MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control expression of thousands of genes in plants and
animals. miRNAs function by guiding Argonaute proteins to complementary sites in 
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) targeted for repression. We determined crystal structures 
of human Argonaute-2 (Ago2) bound to a defined guide RNA with and without target 
RNAs representing miRNA recognition sites. These structures suggest a stepwise
mechanism, in which Ago2 primarily exposes guide nucleotides (nt) 2 to 5 for
initial target pairing. Pairing to nt 2 to 5 promotes conformational changes that
expose nt 2 to 8 and 13 to 16 for further target recognition. Interactions with
the guide-target minor groove allow Ago2 to interrogate target RNAs in a
sequence-independent manner, whereas an adenosine binding-pocket opposite guide
nt 1 further facilitates target recognition. Spurious slicing of miRNA targets is
avoided through an inhibitory coordination of one catalytic magnesium ion. These 
results explain the conserved nucleotide-pairing patterns in animal miRNA target 
sites first observed over two decades ago.
