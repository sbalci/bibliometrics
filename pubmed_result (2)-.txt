OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine cytomegalovirus (CMV)
seroprevalence, low and high avidities, and the frequency of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) positivity and neonatal disease in an obstetric population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera of 32,188 women were tested for CMV IgM and/or CMV
IgG between 2008 and 2017. Those with IgM were tested for antibody avidity. Of
those with low avidity, PCR was offered.
RESULTS: The frequency of CMV IgG and IgM seropositivity was 62% (16,759/26,854) 
and 22% (74/32,188). The number with low avidity was 42. In 36/42, the infants
were PCR tested for CMV and 9 were CMV positive. Only one infant had signs of
congenital CMV infection at the time of birth.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the prevalence of Cytomegalovirus infections in a
tertiary referral center in Turkey. Although universal screening is not
recommended, it can be helpful for the prevention of congenital infection for
seronegative women to be advised to at-risk patients due to high prevalence of
CMV exposure.

BACKGROUND: Ectopia cordis (EC) is a congenital anomaly associated with heart
defects and extracardiac malformations.
OBJECTIVES: We determined the various presentations of EC diagnosed in our center
between 2010 and 2017.
RESULTS: Seven fetuses from six pregnancies with EC were detected, five during
the first trimester. Three were from multiple pregnancies, and both twins had EC 
in one monochorionic-monoamniotic pregnancy. Abdominal wall defects were detected
in six fetuses. Kyphoscoliosis, cephalocele, clubfoot and short umbilical cord
were other abnormalities. Five fetuses were terminated, one fetus died in utero, 
and one baby died on day two of life. Postnatal evaluation performed in all cases
additionally detected cleft lips/palates in two fetuses and tetralogy of Fallot
in one.
CONCLUSION: Outcome is poor for these fetuses, EC can occur in a multiple
pregnancy, most of the abnormalities can be identified in the first trimester and
fetopsy continues to add information to the intrauterine diagnosis.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are orchestrators of the pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) microenvironment. Stromal heterogeneity may explain
differential pathophysiological roles of the stroma (pro- vs. anti-tumoral) in
PDAC. We hypothesized that multiple CAF functional subtypes exist in PDAC, that
contribute to stromal heterogeneity through interactions with cancer cells. Using
molecular and functional analysis of patient-derived CAF primary cultures, we
demonstrated that human PDAC-derived CAFs display a high level of inter- and
intra-tumour heterogeneity. We identified at least four subtypes of CAFs based on
transcriptomic analysis, and propose a classification for human PDAC-derived CAFs
(pCAFassigner). Multiple CAF subtypes co-existed in individual patient samples.
The presence of these CAF subtypes in bulk tumours was confirmed using publicly
available gene expression profiles, and immunostainings of CAF subtype markers.
Each subtype displayed specific phenotypic features (matrix- and immune-related
signatures, vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin expression, proliferation rate),
and was associated with an assessable prognostic impact. A prolonged exposure of 
non-tumoral pancreatic stellate cells to conditioned media from cancer cell lines
(cancer education experiment) induced a CAF-like phenotype, including loss of
capacity to revert to quiescence and an increase in the expression of genes
related to CAF subtypes B and C. This classification demonstrates molecular and
functional inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity of CAFs in human PDAC. Our
subtypes overlap with those identified from single-cell analyses in other
cancers, and pave the way for the development of therapies targeting specific CAF
sub-populations in PDAC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

OBJECTIVE: Stress and obesity lead structural and functional abnormalities in
many organs. This research investigated the effect of these two risk factors on
sperm parameters and histologic structure of testis in rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four male rats were divided into four groups with
six rats in each group as control, stress, obesity, and stress-obesity groups.
The rats of obesity and stress-obesity groups were fed high-fat diet for 12-week 
and obesity was created. Control and stress groups were given standard rat chow
for the same time. Through last 4-week, stress and stress-obesity groups were
applied to chronic mild stress procedure. At the end of the experiment,
epididymal sperm was collected from vas deferens and testes were harvested from
sacrificed animals. Sperm samples were evaluated in terms of concentration and
motility by using Makler Chamber. Sperm smears were stained with Eosin-Y stain
for morphological evaluation, and also histochemically for GABA transporter-1
(GAT1) expression assessment. Testis sections were dyed with Hematoxylin-Eosin
and Johnsen scores were assessed. GAT1 expression was detected in testis sections
by immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL method was used for determining apoptosis in
testis.
RESULTS: In comparison with the control samples in stress, obesity, and
stress-obesity groups sperm concentration and motility decreased, and also the
number of sperm with abnormal morphology increased. Stress, obesity, and
stress-obesity groups showed a significantly decreased in sperm concentration and
motility in comparison with the control group, and also in these groups had
significantly increased number of abnormal sperm compared to control.
Additionally, the testicular structure was deteriorated, and Johnsen scores
decreased. And also GAT1 expression and apoptosis were prominent. These negative 
results, especially, testicular weight, sperm concentration, and Johnsen score
were more observed in the stress-obesity group.
CONCLUSIONS: Stress and obesity may induce male infertility by disrupting both
sperm quality and testis histology. When stress and obesity are coexisting, these
adverse effects are more severe. And also, increased GAT1 expression may be
associated with these effects.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading 
causes of death worldwide and associated with decreased lung function and
inflammation. The heterogeneity of COPD and its molecular and clinical features
hinder efficient patient stratification and introduction of personalized
therapeutic approaches. The available clinical tools do not efficiently predict
the progression and exacerbations of the disease. Areas covered: An overview of
the most recent studies on putative COPD protein biomarkers and the challenges
for implementing their use in the clinical setting is presented. Expert
commentary: Proteomics biomarker discovery in COPD has mostly focused on
approaches evaluating specific proteins on a limited number of samples. The most 
promising protein candidates can be classified into five main biological
categories: extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, inflammation/immune response, 
oxidative stress response, vascular tone regulation, and lipid metabolism. To
efficiently stratify COPD patients and predict exacerbations, it will be
necessary to implement biomarker panels to better represent the complex
pathophysiology of this disease. The application of unbiased proteomics and
bioinformatics followed by appropriate clinical validation studies will
contribute to the achievement of this aim while increasing the number of
validated biomarkers that can enter the qualification processes by the regulatory
entities.

Cystic Anastomosing Hemangioma of the Ovary: A Case Report With
Immunohistochemical and Ultrastructural Analysis.

Gunduz M(1), Hurdogan O(1), Onder S(1), Yavuz E(1).

Author information: 
(1)1 Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.

In this article, we present a case of anastomosing hemangioma that shows cystic
change. The tumor was a unilocular cystic lesion consisting of 2 distinct layers.
The inner layer was composed of a proliferation of capillary-sized blood vessels 
resembling red pulp of the spleen. The outer layer was composed of stromal cells 
that resembled Leydig or steroid cell tumor of the ovary. An immunohistochemical 
examination confirmed endothelial and stromal characteristics of the layers,
respectively. An ultrastructural analysis revealed absence of Reinke crystalloids
in the stromal cells. We conclude that anastomosing hemangioma may rarely arise
from the ovary as a cystic tumor and may be accompanied with luteinization of
stromal cells.

The recent description of noninvasive follicular tumor with papillary-like
nuclear features (NIFTP) creates several diagnostic and therapeutic challenges
for both the pathologist and the attending clinician. Given the concern about
overtreatment of these neoplasms, the best way to manage the patients by a
surgical procedure and post-surgical follow-up is still under discussion. We
aimed to identify predictors of synchronous disease (eg, bilateral cancers) that 
can influence the appropriate type of surgery and long-term surveillance. We
reevaluated the original diagnosis and the presence of contralateral lesions in
94 cases retrieved from our archives that were seen between 2010 and 2017. In 74 
cases, the diagnosis was NIFTP and in 20 cases infiltrative follicular variant of
papillary thyroid carcinoma (IFVPTC). Bilateral disease was found in 17% of the
cases. In 13 (18%) of those cases, NIFTP was the primary lesion, and in three
(15%), it was IFVPTC. The contralateral disease was predominantly invasive: 6
cases of micropapillary carcinoma, 5 of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 3 of IFVPTC,
and 2 of NIFTP. Despite the higher frequency of contralateral disease in NIFTP,
there was no statistically significant difference with IFVPTC. In the patients
with multifocal NIFTP, 2 (15%) of the contralateral malignancies showed
microscopic extrathyroidal extension (P<.05). We conclude that close monitoring
of the contralateral lobe is appropriate in patients with FVPTC, particularly
NIFTP, if they are not submitted to total thyroidectomy.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing which can be
attributed in part to improved ultrasonography (US) methods and increased
detection of incidental thyroid carcinomas (ITC). We aimed to compare ITC with
nonincidental thyroid carcinomas (NITC) in this study.
METHODS: Retrospective analyses of 906 individual patients who were operated for 
benign and malignant thyroid disease and had a final histopathological diagnosis 
of thyroid carcinoma were enrolled in this study. Preoperative US examination and
fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy results were evaluated. The tumor foci in
thyroidectomy specimens that were not represented in preoperative US or FNA
reports were classified as ITC. The tumor foci that match with the lesions
defined in US or FNA results were classified as NITC.
RESULTS: Final histology revealed ITC in 326 patients (36%) and NITC in 580
patients (64% Mean age was 51.7 ± 11.11 in ITC group and 48.15 ± 13.1 in NITC
group (P < .001). In NITC group 322 (55.5%) of the patients were operated for
suspicious cytology while only 29 (8.9%) of the patients in the ITC group were
operated because of this indication (P < .001). There were 1301 cancer foci in
histopathology specimens. Among all these cancer foci, 434 (33.3%) were detected 
incidentally and 867 (66.7%) were detected non-incidentally. About 779 (89.9%) of
nonincidental cancer foci were papillary cancer (PTC), while all of the
incidental cancer foci were PTC. Mean size was 13 mm in NITC group and it was 3
mm in the ITC group and differed significantly between the groups (P < .001).
Tumor size was ≤1 cm in 35.2% of the patients with NITC while 98.5% of patients
with ITC had tumor ≤1 cm. The occurrence of multinodularity was higher in ITC
than the NITC group (P < 001). Median TSH level was higher in patients with NITC 
than ITC while both were in the reference range (1.53 vs 1.03 μIU/mL, P < .001). 
The frequency of thyroiditis detected by US, and thyroid peroxidase antibody and 
thyroglobulin antibody positivities were similar in patients with ITC and NITC
(P = .2, P = .86, and P = .26, respectively). The frequencies of capsular
invasion (29.1% vs 7.9%), extrathyroidal extension (13% vs 4.2%), multifocality
(35.8% vs 24.2%), non-complete resection (9.2% vs 1.8%), and lymph node
metastasis (9.5% vs 1.8%) were significantly higher in the NITC group (P < .001, 
for each). Persistent/recurrent disease in patients with NITC was more frequent
than patients with ITC (P = .004). This outcome was similar for cancers measuring
≤1 cm (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: ITC is often encountered in older patients and frequently determined 
in early stages with more favorable histopathological features and better
prognosis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The accurate identification of hyper functioning
parathyroid gland is needed for definitive surgical treatment in primary
hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasonography and 99mTechnetium sestamibi scintigraphy are
the two most used methods with varying sensitivities. This study aimed to assess 
the value of parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay in preoperative ultrasound guided
fine needle aspiration (FNA)-PTH washout fluid to verify the correct localisation
of lesions with negative or inconclusive scintigraphy results.
METHODS: We evaluated data of 28 lesions in 21 patients who underwent US-guided
parathyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with PTH washout, retrospectively. The
PTH washout results and the reports of parathyroid surgery and imaging studies
were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of operated 28 lesions 23 had positive and 5 had negative washout
results. The median FNA-PTH washout was 2315.5 pg/ ml (min-max: 12.3-6978 pg/
ml). The calculated sensitivity of FNA-PTH washout was 85.7% and the specifity
was 28.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 78.3% and 40.0%,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: FNA-PTH can be used to establish the nature of the lesion,
discriminate parathyroid gland from thyroid lesions or cervical lymph nodes,
improving the surgical outcomes. It can be used to localise parathyroid lesions
preoperatively when negative or discordant ultrasound and scintigraphy findings
are obtained.

Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the uterine cervix is a rare
aggressive tumor. The examination of a cervicovaginal smear from a 31-year-old
patient diagnosed with LCNEC after a cervical polypectomy during the 32nd week of
pregnancy was carried out. The observed atypical cells had large cytoplasm,
increased nucleus: cytoplasm ratio with the nucleus containing coarse, dispersed 
chromatin, and were arranged in a pseudorosette formation, which all confirmed
the diagnosis. In addition, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was determined in the
histopathological examination of the subsequent hysterectomy material. Given the 
rarity of this condition, we present and discuss the case herein.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Koc University School of Medicine, Topkapi /
Zeytinburnu, 34010, Istanbul, Turkey. dertoy@kuh.ku.edu.tr.

BACKGROUND: Massive localized lymphedema (MLL) is a non-neoplastic benign soft
tissue lesion that may be confused with sarcomas or other neoplastic
proliferations both clinically and morphologically. Most occur in morbidly obese 
adults on the lower extremities. The objective of this article is to document a
case of MLL in the retroperitoneal cavity which is a previously unreported site
for this lesion, and to highlight its unusual clinical features.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a non-obese male who had undergone major
abdominal surgery due to bladder extrophy 17 years ago. Abdominal ultrasonography
detected a large incidental mass in the right renal sinus during his
investigation for nephrolithiasis. The lesion extending from renal pelvis down to
pelvis was resected and its histopathological findings were compatible with
massive localized lymphedema.
CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneum has to be added to the list of locations that MLL
can be found. Liposarcoma will be a challenging differential diagnosis when the
lesion is encountered in an unusual site.

Prevalence of high-risk human papilloma virus in liquid-based cervical samples
from Turkish women with normal and abnormal cytology.

Seneldir H(1), Kir G(1).

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul Medeniyet University, Göztepe Research and Training Hospital,
Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of human
papilloma virus (HPV) infection from Turkish women with normal and abnormal
cytology.
METHODS: Our study population consisted of 1252 women with normal and abnormal
cytology. In our clinic, cervical cancer screening was performed by liquid-based 
cytology testing (ThinPrep Pap Test). Reflex high-risk (HR) HPV testing (Cervista
HPV HR and HPV 16/18) was performed in cases with abnormal cytology (n = 330). HR
HPV testing was performed to 922 cases with normal cytology.
RESULTS: HR HPV was detected in 18.7% of negative for intraepithelial lesion or
malignancy (NILM) samples, and in 79.7% of abnormal cytology cases. HPV types 16 
and/or 18 were found in 18.6% and 35.3% of normal cytology cases and abnormal
cytology cases, respectively. Of all 435 HR HPV-positive samples, HPV type 16
and/or 18 prevalence was significantly higher in cases with more severe
cytological abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPV prevalence among Turkish women with normal and abnormal
cytology identified in this study largely concurs with those in other studies
throughout the world. HPV types 16 and/or 18 were detected significantly in
normal cytology cases in our study. We also found that, as has been previously
demonstrated, certain HPV genotypes (16/18) are associated with more severe
pathologies. However, larger epidemiological studies in different regions of

Activating mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase
(TERT) gene are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
of the bladder and upper urinary tract. While the cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene is
commonly mutated in the clinically aggressive plasmacytoid variant of urothelial 
carcinoma (PUC), little is known about their TERT promoter mutation status. A
retrospective search of our archives for PUC and UC with plasmacytoid and/or
signet ring cell features (2007-2014) was performed. Ten specimens from 10
patients had archived material available for DNA analysis and were included in
the study. Intratumoral areas of non-plasmacytoid histology were also evaluated
when present. Samples were analyzed for TERT promoter mutations with Safe-SeqS, a
sequencing error-reduction technology, and sequenced using a targeted panel of
the 10 most commonly mutated genes in bladder cancer on the Illumina MiSeq
platform. TERT promoter mutations were detected in specimens with pure and focal 
plasmacytoid features (6 of 10). Similar to conventional UC, the predominant
mutation identified was g.1295228C>T. In heterogeneous tumors with focal variant 
histology, concordant mutations were found in plasmacytoid and corresponding
conventional, glandular, or sarcomatoid areas. Co-occurring mutations in tumor
protein p53 (TP53, 2 cases) and kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) viral proto-oncogene
(1 case) were also detected. TERT promoter mutations are frequently present in
PUC, which provides further evidence that TERT promoter mutations are common
events in bladder cancer, regardless of histologic subtype, and supports their
inclusion in any liquid biopsy assay for bladder cancer.

OBJECTIVES: According to the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical
Pathology (ASCCP), cervical cytology patients who test positive for atypical
squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and the human papilloma virus
(HPV) positive are recommended to undergo colposcopies. This study compared the
colposcopic biopsy evaluation results of patients with positive cervical cytology
results for ASCUS and HPV with regards to their HPV genotypes.
METHODS: This study included 179 patients who underwent cervical cancer screening
tests between June 2015 and June 2017 and whose results displayed positive
cervical cervical cytology results for ASCUS and HPV. Cytological samples were
classified using the Bethesda system in liquid-based specimens. The Hybrid
Capture II system was used to define the HPV-DNA. Colposcopic diagnoses and
biopsy results were compared in terms of the outcomes of the Pap test and HPV
genotypes.
RESULTS: There were 107 ASCUS/HPV16/18-positive patients. Of the HPV 16/18
positive patients; 28 (26.1%) patients were detected with CIN1, 8 (7.5%) patients
were detected with CIN2, 6 (6%) patients were detected with CIN3, and 1 (0.9%)
patient was detected with cervical cancer. Of the 72 non-HPV 16-18 positive
patients; 8 (11%) patients were detected with CIN1 and 2 (2.7%) patients were
detected with CIN2.
CONCLUSION: This study believes that the ASCCP recommendations, which state that 
a 'colposcopy should be performed on all women with positive cytology for
ASCUS/non-HPV16/18 oncogenic types', is required to be revised. This will reduce 
the rate of the colposcopy procedures by 40% in women with ASCUS/HPV positivity.

Serous effusion fluid is one of the most commonly encountered specimens in
routine cytopathology practice. It provides invaluable information about the
patient and the clinical status; but to get the most of it, specimen handling and
processing must be carried out properly. Cytomorphology is the basis of a
successful analysis which should complemented by ancillary tests when needed. A
wide spectrum of ancillary techniques - ranging from immunocytochemistry and flow
cytometry to different assays of molecular pathology - can be applied to serous
effusions. This article describes the acquisition and management of serous
effusion fluids, methods for preservation and transportation, different
techniques of cytopreparation, application of immunocytochemistry, flow
cytometry, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), as well as DNA
extraction for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing
(NGS). Principles of bio-banking of effusion samples are also discussed which is 
getting more important in correlation with the developments in personalized
medicine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Background: There is no specific marker that shows the disease activity in
Behçet's disease.
Aim: In this study, we aimed to investigate VEGF-B and VEGF gene expressions and 
sTREM-1 levels in association with the activation of Behçet's disease.
Study Design: Case-control study.
Methods: Clinical features of patients who applied in the rheumatology clinic and
were diagnosed with BD according to the international working group's criteria
were investigated. 30 healthy volunteers and 30 patients in the active period
according to the EBDCAF scoring were studied. VEGF-B and VEGF gene expressions
and sTREM-1 levels were studied in the serum samples of the patients and the
control subjects.
Results: The VEGF-B expressions and sTREM-1 levels were higher in the BD than
those in the healthy group, but this difference did not reach statistical
significance. VEGF gene expression was statistically significant (p = 0.008).
Behçet's disease patients with oral aphthae, genital ulcer, eye, joint, vascular,
skin, and neurological involvement were analyzed separately as subgroups. We find
that VEGF gene expression level of Behçet's disease patients with joint
involvement (arthritis/arthralgia) and also VEGF-B and VEGF gene expression of
Behçet's disease with vascular involvement (DVT/thrombophlebitis) were
significantly higher (p = 0.035, p = 0.021). Each subgroup was analyzed with the 
control group. We determined that VEGF gene expression in all subgroups was
significantly higher than that in the control group. At the same time, VEGF-B
levels of patients with genital ulcer and vascular involvement
(DVT/thrombophlebitis) were significantly higher than those in the control group.
Conclusion: VEGF-B and VEGF gene expressions can be activity indicators for BD.
In addition, this study shows that new treatment options should be explored for
Behçet's disease patients with joint and vascular involvement. In the following
years, new treatment methods are needed to investigate for revealing the role of 
the etiopathogenesis of BD and the activation and prognosis of VEGF by examining 
this study and providing much more participation. In our study group, the sTREM-1
levels were high but the results did not reach statistical significance. More
studies are needed with larger groups in order the highlight the exact role of
STREM-1 in Behçet's disease.

Amniotic fluid (AF) is the liquid layer that provides mechanical support and
allows movement of the fetus during embryogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
which have differentiation capacity, are also found in AF-derived cells at a low 
ratio. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play an important role in organ function and
are frequently used in tissue engineering. We examined the differentiation of
AF-derived MSCs (AMSCs) into SMCs. AMSCs were sorted from cultured amniotic cells
and differentiated into SMCs using differentiation agents, including
platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and tumor growth factor β (TGF-β).
Characterization of differentiated SMCs was confirmed morphologically,
molecularly (via quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] and
immunocytochemistry [ICC]), and functionally (using a contractile assay and
fluo-4 calcium signaling assay). Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds were
fabricated, and the attachment capacity of AMSCs was assessed via scanning
electron microscopy. AMSCs were successfully differentiated into SMCs. Our
results indicate that AMSCs change their morphology and exhibit increased
expression of ACTA2 and MYH11, which was confirmed via qPCR and ICC. Furthermore,
functional experiments revealed that differentiated SMCs had both contraction
ability and increased Ca2 concentration in the cytoplasm. Finally, PLGA scaffolds
were prepared and AMSCs were successfully planted onto the scaffolds. The AMSCs
fully differentiated into functional SMCs, and the PLGA polymer is a suitable
scaffold material for AMSCs. With further clinical trials, AF-derived MSC-based
SMC engineering may become a highly efficient treatment option.

Following an injury or resection, the mammalian liver has the capacity to regain 
its former volume and functioning by restoring itself. Studies have demonstrated 
that antioxidants play a role in hepatic regeneration. This study investigated
the effect of 4-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyloxymethyl) phenyl-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (PG)
obtained from Origanum micranthum on liver regeneration. Sixty Wistar Albino rats
were used. In the sham-operated group, a midline abdominal laparotomy was
performed without hepatectomy. In the partial hepatectomy (PHx) group, the median
and left lateral lobes were removed. Rats in the PHx group received 20 mg/kg/day 
PG intraperitoneally before being sacrificed at 24, 48, and 72 hrs, and 7 days
later. Liver tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis and electron
microscopic evaluation. We found an increase in mitotic index, and the numbers of
Ki-67 stained hepatocytes in all PHx early stage groups (24 hr, 48hr, 72 hr), but
not in 7-day groups. The regeneration mediators eNOS, iNOS, TNF-α and NF-kB were 
shown to increase in PHx groups. This increase was more prominent dependening on 
time. In the PHx treatment (PHx+PG) groups, while eNOS was still high, iNOS,
TNF-α and NF-kB had decreased. The apoptotic index was markedly high in the PHx
groups; this was prevented by PG treatment. These findings were supported by the 
ultrastructural results. Our findings indicate that PG supports liver
regeneration, hepatocyte proliferation, reduced liver damage, and inflammatory
mediators following PHx.

The modern classification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors relies mainly on
immunohistochemistry for pituitary transcription factors, hormones, and other
biomarkers, including low molecular weight cytokeratins. The transcription factor
GATA2 is required for development of gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs but has not
been used for classification of pituitary tumors. Because of genomic paralogy of 
GATA2 and GATA3, we postulated that GATA3 immunohistochemistry may detect GATA2
in the adenohypophysis. We examined 151 tumors originating from Ondokuz Mayis
University, Turkey (n = 83) and University Health Network, Canada (n = 68).
Initially, 83 tumors (26 gonadotroph, 24 somatotroph, 17 corticotroph, 12
lactotroph, 2 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors that expressed TSH and 2
null cell tumors) from Ondokuz Mayis University were investigated with the GATA3 
monoclonal antibody L50-823. Retrospective review of the files of University
Health Network identified 68 tumors (43 gonadotroph, 3 somatotroph, 2 lactotroph,
1 mammosomatotroph, 9 corticotroph, 7 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors 
with TSH expression, 2 plurihormonal tumors with TSH expression and 1 null cell
tumor) that were examined with the same GATA3 antibody and served as a validation
cohort. All somatotroph, lactotroph and mammosomatotroph tumors and the null cell
tumors were negative for GATA3. Sixty-eight (98.5%) gonadotroph tumors were
positive for GATA3; 64 had diffuse reactivity. Two plurihormonal tumors with TSH 
expression and eight (88.8%) poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors with
variable TSH expression were positive for GATA3. One of 26 (3.8%) corticotroph
tumors was diffusely positive for GATA3. This study shows that GATA3
immunoreactivity is characteristic of pituitary gonadotroph and TSH-producing
tumors. This finding expands the pattern of transcription factors that are used
to classify adenohypophysial tumors and is important in the differential
diagnosis of sellar tumors, as GATA3 expression is also a feature of primary
sellar paragangliomas as well as carcinomas that may metastasize to the sella.

AIM: Juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) have been recently
reclassified into clinico-serological subgroups. Myopathological correlates of
the subgroups are incompletely understood.
METHODS: We studied muscle biopsies from 101 children with clinically and
serologically-defined juvenile IIM from the UK JDM Cohort and Biomarker Study by 
applying the international JDM score tool, myopathological review, and C5b-9
complement analysis.
RESULTS: Autoantibody data were available for 90/101 cases with 18/90 cases
positive for anti-TIF1γ, 15/90 anti-NXP2, 11/90 anti-MDA5, 5/90 anti-Mi2, and
6/90 anti-PmScl. JDM biopsy severity scores were consistently low in the
anti-MDA5 group, high in the anti-Mi2 group, and widely distributed in the other 
groups. Biopsies were classified histologically as perifascicular atrophy
(22/101), macrophage-rich necrosis (6/101), scattered necrosis (2/101), clustered
necrosis (2/101), inflammatory fibre invasion (2/101), chronic myopathic change
(1/101), diffuse endomysial macrophage infiltrates (40/101), and minimal change
(24/101). MDA5 cases segregated with the minimal change group and showed no
capillary C5b-9-deposition. The Mi2 group displayed high severity scores and a
tendency towards sarcolemmal complement deposition. NXP2 and TIF1γ groups showed 
a variety of pathologies with a high proportion of diffuse endomysial macrophage 
infiltrates and a high proportion of capillary C5b-9 deposition.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have a
spectrum of histopathological phenotypes and show distinct complement attack
complex deposition patterns. Both correlate in some cases with the serological
subtypes. Most cases do not show typical histological features associated with
dermatomyositis (e.g. perifascicular atrophy). In contrast, more than half show
relatively mild histopathological changes. This article is protected by

BACKGROUND: Recently a new system for reporting salivary gland fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) cytology was proposed, the Milan System for Reporting Salivary
Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC). Herein, we evaluated diagnostic accuracy of
salivary gland FNA, comparing the system previously used in our hospital with the
Milan system.
METHODS: Salivary gland specimens obtained between 2011 and 2017 were
reclassified according to MSRSGC. Risk of malignancy for each diagnostic category
was determined. Diagnostic yield of both classifications was evaluated.
RESULTS: The cases (n = 388) were classified according to the old system:
nondiagnostic (n = 28), benign (n = 246), atypical (n = 36), neoplastic (n = 57),
suspicious for malignancy (n = 7) and malignant (n = 14). The lesions were
distributed according to the MSRSGC: nondiagnostic (n = 28), non-neoplastic (n
= 89), atypia of undetermined significance (n = 39), benign neoplasm (n = 156),
neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential (n = 55), suspicious for malignancy (n 
= 7) and malignant (n = 14). When considering only benign and malignant cases,
both classifications showed the same sensitivity (62.5%), specificity (100%) and 
similar accuracy (95.8%). Comparison between the two systems showed no
significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Salivary gland FNA has high diagnostic accuracy and assists clinical
management independently of the reporting system used, however, in some cases,
the use of Milan system could be beneficial, since it allows an enhanced category
stratification.

Tumor deposits (TD) are irregular discrete tumor masses in adipose tissue,
discontinuous from the primary tumor, that are described in various cancers. The 
incidence and/or prognostic value of TD in breast carcinomas have not been
studied so far. We reevaluated 145 breast cancer patients, diagnosed and treated 
between 2001 and 2006 at our institution for the presence and incidence of TD.
Histologic type, grade, size of the primary tumor, estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status of the
tumor, and presence of peritumoral lymphovascular invasion were included in the
data. TD were detected in 42 cases (29.0%). The mean age of the patients was
52.2 years (27-82). Most patients (79.3%) had either invasive carcinoma of no
special type (NST) or invasive lobular carcinoma, and most tumors (86.9%) were
either grade 2 or 3. After excluding TD from the number of metastatic lymph
nodes, the pN status of 9 patients changed. Univariate analysis of 110 patients
with follow-up information revealed that the new pN status (p = 0.036), presence 
of local recurrence (p = 0.016) and TD (p = 0.003) were significantly correlated 
with distant metastases. The median follow-up of the patients was 84 months
(5-161), 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 67.2% and 73.7%,
respectively. In multivariate analysis, presence of TD remained independently
associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.002). The probability of distant
metastasis was 3.3 times higher in patients with TD. These results emphasize that
TD are present in breast cancer patients, and that their presence should warn the
clinician in terms of possible distant metastasis. Therefore, presence of TD, the
evaluation of which is neither time consuming nor require sophisticated methods, 
should be included in pathology reports.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) are classified according
to tumor grade. Ki-67 and mitotic count are the two determinants of this
classification. Therefore, Ki-67 scoring becomes very important in classifying
the patients accurately. Eye-balling, counting of cells through the microscope,
automated image analysis systems, and manual counting of printed image are the
four major scoring methods in use. The aim of this study is to show the agreement
between monitor-image method (MIM) and printout-image method (PIM) of Ki-67
scoring. In our study, 120 GEP-NETs from 85 patients diagnosed between January
2005 and July 2017 were evaluated. Thirty-seven cases with either polypectomy or 
resection material were selected. Seven different scoring methods using either a 
monitor-image or a printout-image were applied for Ki-67 scoring. They are as
follows: whole-PIM, 1/9-PIM, whole-MIM, 1/4-MIM, 1/6-MIM, 1/9-MIM, and 1/12-MIM. 
In the comparison of Ki-67 scoring methods, intraclass correlation coefficients
ranging from 0.951 to 0.999 were found. The Bland-Altman analysis showed
near-perfect agreement between whole-MIM and whole-PIM as well as 1/9-MIM and
1/9-PIM. The level of agreements among the other methods were sufficient too, but
there was a relative decrease in the level of agreement as the area of counting
becomes smaller. The average application time decreased from 373.7 to 41.7 s
gradually as the scoring area becomes smaller. Our study shows that there is a
remarkable agreement between the MIM and PIM used in Ki-67 scoring.

To evaluate the association between type of invaded vessels (blood or lymphatic) 
and cervical involvement in endometrial cancer (EC). Pathological slides of 93
patients with EC who had vascular space invasion in hematoxylin-eosin staining
underwent immunohistochemical assay with CD31 and podoplanin. CD31 and podoplanin
were used to identify blood and lymphatic invaded vessels, respectively. Cervical
stromal invasion (CSI) was determined in 21 (30%) patients. The rate of
CD31-positivity was significantly higher in patients with CSI than without (76.2 
and 34.7%, p = 0.001; respectively). Podoplanin-positivity was determined in 47.6
and 81.6% of patients with and without CSI, respectively (p = 0.005). Age,
myometrial invasion and the combination of CD31-positivity with
podoplanin-negativity were found as independent predictors for CSI. Blood vessel 
invasion is an important factor for CSI in EC. Blood vessel invasion rather than 
lymphatic vessel invasion is one of the predominant ways by which EC spreads to
the cervix.

GOAL: We evaluated the potential for prenatal diagnosis of merosin-negative
muscular dystrophies by immunohistochemistry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 12 pregnancies with
merosin-negative muscular dystrophy in a prior child. Chorionic villus sampling
(CVS) was performed between 11th to 13th gestational weeks. Merosin
immunohistochemical studies were performed on trophoblastic cells.
RESULTS: Two of 12 were "merosin-negative," both were from the same family. Fetal
ultrasonographies were evaluated as normal in these pregnancies. Eight of the 10 
merosin-positive cases delivered healthy babies. Two were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis of merosin-negative muscular dystrophies can be
accomplished by immunohistochemical analysis.

BACKGROUND: In the present study, we primarily aimed to correlate the colposcopy 
results of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity and abnormal
cervical screening results. Secondarily, we attempted to define the role of
endocervical curettage (ECC) in the colposcopic evaluation of patients who had
normal cytology and HPV16, which is the most carcinogenic HPV type.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study analyzing the data of patients who had
colposcopies between January 2015 and May 2016 in the Gynecological Oncology
clinic of a single tertiary center. The data were evaluated to identify the
pathologies in patients with HPV positivity and abnormal cervical screening
results. A Colposcopic examination database was evaluated to obtain information
regarding the cervical transformation zone (TZ), which was divided into three
types by the International Federation for Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy. The 
binary variables were reported as counts and percentages.
RESULTS: A total of 1049 patients were included in the analysis. The median age
of the patients was 43 (range: 21-79). Cervical biopsies, ECC results, or both
revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN2+: CIN2, CIN3, and invasive
cancer) lesions in 22% (70/322) of the patients with HPV16 positivity, while this
ratio was 8% (6/78) for patients with HPV18. CIN2+ lesions were detected in the
2.5% of patients with HPV positivity for types other than 16 and 18, as well as
normal cytology. In the group of patients with HPV 16 and normal cytology, CIN2+ 
results were observed in the ECC of 11% of the patients whose colposcopy was
normal regardless of the TZ type. Ten of the patients had invasive cancer.
CONCLUSION: The current study provides evidence for the possible role of routine 
ECC in patients with HPV16, normal cytology, and a normal colposcopy.

Low-grade epilepsy-associated brain tumours (LEAT) are the second most common
cause for drug-resistant, focal epilepsy, that is ganglioglioma (GG) and
dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNT). However, molecular pathogenesis, 
risk factors for malignant progression and their frequent association with
drug-resistant focal seizures remain poorly understood. This contrasts recent
progress in understanding the molecular-genetic basis and targeted treatment
options in diffuse gliomas. The Neuropathology Task Force of the International
League Against Epilepsy examined available literature to identify common
obstacles in diagnosis and research of LEAT. Analysis of 10 published tumour
series from epilepsy surgery pointed to poor inter-rater agreement for the
histopathology diagnosis. The Task Force tested this hypothesis using a web-based
microscopy agreement study. In a series of 30 LEAT, 25 raters from 18 countries
agreed in only 40% of cases. Highest discordance in microscopic diagnosis
occurred between GG and DNT variants, when oligodendroglial-like cell patterns
prevail, or ganglion cells were difficult to discriminate from pre-existing
neurons. Suggesting new terminology or major histopathological criteria did not
satisfactorily increase the yield of histopathology agreement in four consecutive
trials. To this end, the Task Force applied the WHO 2016 strategy of integrating 
phenotype analysis with molecular-genetic data obtained from panel sequencing and
450k methylation arrays. This strategy was helpful to distinguish DNT from GG
variants in all cases. The Task Force recommends, therefore, to further develop
diagnostic panels for the integration of phenotype-genotype analysis in order to 
reliably classify the spectrum of LEAT, carefully characterize clinically
meaningful entities and make better use of published literature.

Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is the second most
common subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after classical PTC (cPTC).
Follicular thyroid lesions such as follicular adenomas/carcinomas, FVPTC, and
noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features
(NIFTP) pose some diagnostic challenges for FNAC. In this study, we aimed to
explore whether FNAC can demonstrate diagnostic clues by re-evaluating cytology
slides from histopathologically diagnosed FVPTC cases. A total of 42 patients
were enrolled in this study: patients were diagnosed with FVPTC via surgical
resection between 2006 and 2016, and all patients were subjected to preoperative 
FNAC, which was conducted at either a private center or at the teaching hospital 
of Kocaeli University and reported by the same cytopathologist (NP). Clinical and
cytomorphological characteristics were reviewed by both authors .Most cases
(76.2%) are diagnosed either Bethesda IV or V. The majority of cases had a high
cellularity (38/42; 90.5%), and the most frequent observations were monolayer and
large syncytial groups of cells (95.2%). While microfollicular structures were
observed in 30 (71.4%) cases, nuclear crowding and large naked nuclei were
observed in all cases. Nuclear grooves were sparsely detected in 23 (54.8%)
cases, and nuclear pseudoinclusions were detected in only six (14.3%) cases.
Because thyrocytes often have a mixed architecture in FVPTC, despite a distinct
follicular morphology, we believe that nuclear overcrowding, enlargement, and
hyperchromasia in cases presenting with increased cellularity are notable clues
for the cytodiagnosis of FVPTC. We believe that the primary aim of FNAC in such
cases is to give preoperative diagnosis as either category IV or V. Nuclear
crowding, monolayered clusters with large syncytial formations, nuclear
enlargement, and hyperchromasia are notable cytomorphologic clues for the
diagnosis of FVPTC on FNAC.

Postmortem Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction Due to Butane Gas Intoxication in a
Child: A Case Report.

Bugra A(1), Das T.

Author information: 
(1)From the Pathology Department, Forensic Council of Turkey, Ministry of
Justice, Istanbul, Turkey.

Volatile substance addiction and toxic gas inhalation are now an important health
problem. The pleasure-based inhalation of butane gas, also known as lighter
refill gas, is especially prevalent among children and young people. The most
important reasons for this situation are that they are cheap and easy to obtain
and lack of legal supervision. The exhaled gas is absorbed through the alveolar
surface and rapidly enters the bloodstream and leads to clinical signs. It can
cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, hallucinations, and euphoria in the
acute phase. In severe cases, bronchospasm, hypoxia, ventricular arrhythmia,
cardiopulmonary arrest, and death can occur. Our case is one of the rare cases in
the literature that was diagnosed by postmortem histopathological examination.
Our case is a 15-year-old girl who was found in front of a tobacco product store.
On gross examination, there was a hemorrhagic area under the aortic valve that
continued to interventricular septum. There was no coronary artery lesion.
Histopathological examination revealed hypereosinophilia and contraction band
necrosis in myocardial fibers, which was more intense in papillary muscle.
Immunohistochemical studies also supported early myocardial ischemic changes.
Upon toxicological examination, butane gas was detected in lung and blood
samples.

AIM: To identify the value of processing multiple sections to detect metastasis
in lymph nodes (LNs) dissected during gynecologic cancer surgery, and to evaluate
the sizes of metastatic LNs in each region to compare with the largest one.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 362 patients who had
gynecologic cancer with at least one metastatic LN. Slides of 627 metastatic LN
specimens were categorized according to the processing technique into single and 
more than one section (MOS) groups. In the MOS group, the LNs were cut into 2 or 
3 parallel slices because their greatest dimensions exceeded 0.5 cm. Sizes of LN 
metastatic foci (MF) were measured and defined as follows: MF ⩽2 mm as
micrometastasis and MF >2 mm as macrometastasis. The largest LN diameters among
the metastatic LNs and the largest LNs in those regions were measured. Groups
were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS: Sixty-five (10.3%) of the metastatic LNs included in this study had
micrometastases and 40 (6.3%) of them had MF ⩽1 mm. The rate of micrometastasis
was higher in the MOS group than in the single-section group (11.8% vs 8.5%,
respectively). Twenty-eight percent (n = 175) of metastatic LNs were not the
largest, and 55.5% of those were less than 1 cm in diameter.
CONCLUSION: Methods of LN processing and macroscopic evaluation are not
standardized, and processing single sections from LNs may overlook
micrometastases. The detection rate of micrometastases can be improved by
processing multiple sections from LNs.

INTRODUCTION: Crigler Najjar (CN) disease is a genetic disorder which results in 
increased unconjugated bilirubin level. Liver parenchyma was previously
considered structurally normal. Recent reports describe significant fibrosis in
the liver parenchyma of patients with CN syndrome.
CASE REPORT: We present a patient with persistent unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia, clinically diagnosed as CN-2, with a UGT1 A1 p. H39D
(c.115C > G) (His → Asp) mutation. She required hepatic transplantation at the
age of 17.5 years for biliary cirrhosis. Explanted liver histopathology revealed 
regenerative cirrhotic nodules with dilated bile ducts filled with bile plugs.
CONCLUSION: CN can develop significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis requiring liver
transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: ROS1 is an orphan receptor protein tyrosine kinase which is supposed
to undergo genetic rearrangement in carcinogenesis. In the current study, we
aimed to investigate the frequency and clinicopathologic features associated with
ROS1 gene fusion and ROS1 protein expression in patients with ovarian serous
carcinoma or serous borderline tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples of 102 patients with high or low grade
serous carcinoma and borderline serous tumors were selected randomly from the
archives of Department of Gyneco-pathology, and analyzed for ROS1 gene
expression. (Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method was used to assess 
ROS1 gene rearrangement, while ROS1 protein expression was analyzed using
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The study consisted of 94 cases of high-grade serous carcinoma (92.1%), 
2 cases of low-grade serous carcinoma (%2) and 6 cases of serous borderline tumor
(5.9%). ROS1 gene rearrangement analysis revealed that 4 patients (3.9%) were
FISH-positive; whereas the immunohistochemical analysis yielded only 1 patient
(0.9%) exhibiting faint positive expression of ROS1 protein. Given the low
incidences of ROS1 gene rearrangement and protein expression, their relationships
with clinicopathologic parameters could not be statistically analyzed.
CONCLUSION: Although rare, patients with ovarian serous carcinoma or serous
borderline tumor may exhibit ROS1 gene rearrangement and ROS1 protein expression.
Further large-scale studies are necessary to explore the clinicopathologic
significance of ROS1 gene expression in ovarian serous carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Our aim is to investigate whether the maternal serum levels of first 
and second trimester serum analytes are altered in women with epilepsy in
pregnancy.
METHODS: Maternal serum biochemical markers (estriol, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP],
human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG], free β hCG, pregnancy-associated plasma
protein-A) were compared in a series of 122 pregnant women with epilepsy and in a
cohort of 122 normal pregnant women. The serum samples were obtained between
11-13 6/7 weeks and 16-18 weeks gestation.
RESULTS: Second trimester serum estriol levels, expressed as multiples of the
median (MoM), in the epileptic group (1.55 ± 0.77 MoM) were significantly higher 
than those in the control patients (1.13 ± 0.40 MoM) (p < 0.001). Of the women
with epilepsy, 66.3% (n = 81) were exposed to antiepileptic drugs.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that otherwise uncomplicated pregnant epileptic
women had higher second trimester (18-20 weeks of gestation) estriol levels
compared to non-epileptic pregnant women.

OBJECTIVE: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for evaluation of spongiform
nodules ≥20 mm or observation without FNA was recommended by American Thyroid
Association. However, this was a weak recommendation supported by moderate
quality evidence. We aimed to assess malignancy risk in spongiform nodules.
METHODS: From January 2015 to June 2016, an experienced endocrinologist performed
B-mode greyscale ultrasonography and observed 96 spongiform nodules among 3748
ultrasound procedures. Power Doppler ultrasonography and ultrasound-guided FNA
were performed to 96 spongiform nodules. Both colour elastography and strain
ratio measurements of dominantly solid areas were performed.
RESULTS: All spongiform nodules had benign cytology. Fifty-two (54.2%) nodules
were ≥20 mm and 44 (45.8%) were smaller than 20 mm in maximum diameter. Presence 
of ultrasonography features related to malignancy was rare; 2% (n = 2)
microcalcification, 9.4% (n = 9) taller than wide shape and 2% (n = 2) marked
central blood flow were noted. None of the nodules had two or more suspicious
features. Ultrasound elastography findings revealed that dominantly solid
components of nodules were usually soft as 66.7% had an elasticity score 1
according to colour scale and mean strain ratio was 1.39 ± 0.99.
CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up with ultrasonography seems to be an efficacious method
even for spongiform nodules larger than 2 cm. Determination of soft appearance
according to colour map on ultrasound elastography and low strain ratio values of
dominantly solid areas may be useful to avoid unnecessary biopsies.

Sex determination is a major area of investigation in forensic anthropology. As
technology has advanced, imaging methods such as computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging are being investigated as alternatives to conventional forensic
anthropological research techniques. This study aimed to investigate the
suitability of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of volumetric cranial computed
tomography (CCT) images for sex estimation from skull morphology. In this study, 
CCT angiography images from the Department of Radiology 2017 archives were used
retrospectively, and 3D images were obtained after the reconstruction of 85 cases
of CCT images. The sex-dependent morphological characteristics of the skull were 
evaluated by three blinded observers and scored on a scale of 1-5 points
according to the "Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains". The
accurate sex estimation rates of the first, second and third observers were 91.8,
92.9 and 92.9%, respectively. The rate of accurate sex estimation for males was
98-100%, while this rate varied between 83.3-86.1% for females. Consistency in
sex estimation between the three observers was 83.5%, with a Kappa value of 0.763
(z = 12.2; p = 0.0001*). The glabella was the most effective morphological trait 
used to estimate sex. The results of this study show that sex can be estimated
from morphological features in volume-rendered CCT 3D images. Thus, sex can be
estimated by digital images without the need for maceration processes, and the
transfer of digital data in place of physical material will make it possible to
gain expert opinions in forensic anthropology.

The spectrum of the renal oncocytic tumors has been expanded in recent years to
include several novel and emerging entities. We describe a cohort of novel,
hitherto unrecognized and morphologically distinct high-grade oncocytic tumors
(HOT), currently diagnosed as "unclassified" in the WHO classification. We
identified 14 HOT by searching multiple institutional archives. Morphologic,
immunohistochemical (IHC), molecular genetic, and molecular karyotyping studies
were performed to investigate these tumors. The patients included 3 men and 11
women, with age range from 25 to 73 years (median 50, mean 49 years). Tumor size 
ranged from 1.5 to 7.0 cm in the greatest dimension (median 3, mean 3.4 cm). The 
tumors were all pT1 stage. Microscopically, they showed nested to solid growth,
and focal tubulocystic architecture. The neoplastic cells were uniform with
voluminous oncocytic cytoplasm. Prominent intracytoplasmic vacuoles were
frequently seen, but no irregular (raisinoid) nuclei or perinuclear halos were
present. All tumors demonstrated prominent nucleoli (WHO/ISUP grade 3
equivalent). Nine of 14 cases were positive for CD117 and cytokeratin (CK) 7 was 
either negative or only focally positive in of 6/14 cases. All tumors were
positive for AE1-AE3, CK18, PAX 8, antimitochondrial antigen, and SDHB. Cathepsin
K was positive in 13/14 cases and CD10 was positive in 12/13 cases. All cases
were negative for TFE3, HMB45, Melan-A. No TFEB and TFE3 genes rearrangement was 
found in analyzable cases. By array CGH, complete chromosomal losses or gains
were not found in any of the cases, and 3/9 cases showed absence of any
abnormalities. Chromosomal losses were detected on chromosome 19 (4/9), 3 with
losses of the short arm (p) and 1 with losses of both arms (p and q). Loss of
chromosome 1 was found in 3/9 cases; gain of 5q was found in 1/9 cases. On
molecular karyotyping, 3/3 evaluated cases showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on
16p11.2-11.1 and 2/3 cases showed LOH at 7q31.31. Copy number (CN) losses were
found at 7q11.21 (3/3), Xp11.21 (3/3), Xp11.22-11.21 (3/3), and Xq24-25 (2/3). CN
gains were found at 13q34 (2/3). Ten patients with available follow up
information were alive and without disease progression, after a mean follow-up of
28 months (1 to 112 months). HOT is a tumor with unique morphology and its IHC
profile appears mostly consistent. HOT should be considered as an emerging renal 
entity because it does not meet the diagnostic criteria for other recognized
eosinophilic renal tumors, such as oncocytoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), TFE3 and TFEB RCC, SDH-deficient RCC, and eosinophilic solid and cystic
RCC.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder with worldwide incidence 
of 15%; out of this, it is found in up to 20% in countries like Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia and Bahrain. The standard conventional method of detection is complete
blood count (CBC) followed by hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) or both. In this context, spectral detection of
variants of sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an innovative technique, which when made 
accurate and reliable could be an effective alternative, since the
instrumentation is compact (5 kg) and hence portable. This makes mass screening
even in remote villages possible. In this paper, we give the essential aspects of
fluorescent spectral features of sickle cell trait (SCT), sickle cell disease
(SCD), beta (β) thalassemia trait (BTT) + SCD, and beta (β) thalassemia disease
(BTD) + SCD. All the above four major variants could be discriminated among
themselves and also from the normal control blood sample. All these analyses
could be carried out with 5 ml of blood, in a time period of 10 minutes. The
results of this paper give strong support for an alternative method, a spectral
technique, for molecular-level diagnosis of sickle cell anemia and other closely 
related blood disorders.

Lipomatous tumors accompanied by spindle cell component are not frequently
encountered, and there are still problems regarding their differential diagnosis,
nature, and nomenclature. To contribute to ongoing efforts, we present the
clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of 20 cases of
spindle cell lipomatous tumors with atypical features that may also be called
atypical spindle cell/pleomorphic lipomatous tumors. Of the patients, 13 were men
and 7 were women with an average age of 57.5 years. The most commonly affected
site was the extremities. Twelve tumors arose in the subcutaneous tissue, while
eight cases were located in the deep soft tissues. Tumor margins were often
ill-defined with invasion into the surrounding tissues. Microscopic examination
revealed a wide spectrum of histologic features. All cases consisted of poorly
marginated proliferation of mildly atypical spindle cells set in a fibrous or
myxoid stroma with a variable amount of adipocytic component showing variation in
adipocyte size and scattered nuclear atypia and frequent univacuolated or
multivacuolated lipoblasts. Tumor cellularity and the relative proportion of the 
components were highly variable. One tumor showed morphologic features evocative 
of dedifferentiation and another one exhibited histological features resembling
pleomorphic liposarcoma. None of the patients had recurrence or metastasis at
follow-up.

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is dysregulated in different types of
neoplasms including colorectal cancer (CRC). Aberrant activation of this
signaling pathway is a key early event in the development of colorectal
neoplasms, and is mainly caused by loss of function mutations in Adenomatous
Polyposis Coli (APC), and less frequently by β-catenin stabilization mutations
via missense or interstitial genomic deletions in CTNNB1. In this study, we have 
defined an immunohistochemical algorithm to dissect Wnt pathway alterations in
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissues. Basically, consecutive
sections of tumor specimens were stained by immunohistochemistry with two
different monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin: one (anti-active β-catenin
antibody) recognizes hypo-phosphorylated β-catenin and the other recognizes the
total pool of β-catenin. We validated the strategy in the HCT116 CRC cell line
which has an in-frame deletion of β-catenin serine 45, and then studied human
tumor microarrays containing colon adenomas, CRCs, solid pseudopapillary
neoplasms of the pancreas as well as the whole tissue sections of CRCs, desmoid
fibromatosis, and pilomatrixoma of the skin. In some tumors, we found strong
β-catenin cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining with the total β-catenin antibody
but no staining with the anti-active β-catenin antibody. This was inferred to be 
an altered/mutant β-catenin staining pattern. All six colon adenomas of the 126
total adenomas studied for the altered/mutant β-catenin staining pattern had
presumptively pathogenic point mutations or deletions in CTNNB1. Four of 10 CRCs 
with the alterated/mutant β-catenin staining pattern studied in depth, from 181
total CRCs from tissue microarray, had pathogenic CTNNB1 mutations. The
frequencies of CTNNB1 alterations in non-colonic tumors with altered/mutant
β-catenin staining ranged between 46 and 100%. Our results demonstrate that the
immunohistochemical approach described here can detect oncogenic forms of
β-catenin in primary tissue samples and can also highlight other tumors with
presumptive novel defects activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Evaluation of Ethanol Interference on Routine Biochemical Tests.

Gümüs A(1).

Author information: 
(1)Haseki Training and Research Hospital, Medical Biochemistry Laboratory,
Istanbul, Turkey.

Objectives: Ethanol is a widely consumed drug in almost every society. In this
study, the potential interfering effect of ethanol on routine biochemical tests
was evaluated.
Methods: Serum pools were prepared from blood samples collected from patients
seeking treatment at the emergency department. Five separate groups were formed
by adding ethanol to the samples, so the final concentrations were negative: 50
mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL, and 400 mg/dL. Each group was divided into 20
portions, and routine biochemical tests were measured from each portion. The
coefficient of variation (CV), bias, and total error values were calculated for
the measured parameters.
Results: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT; EC 2.6.1.2) and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) activities decreased in proportion to the ethanol level. High 
negative biases were observed, suggesting a dose-dependent negative interference.
The total error values calculated for direct bilirubin and urea were higher than 
the allowable total error reported in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988. For direct bilirubin, it was observed that the cause of this 
shift was due to the increase in CV values.
Conclusions: We conclude that ethanol may cause interference in the measurement
of some biochemical tests, whereas the most prominent effect was observed for LDH
and ALT.

Objectives: To analyze consistency of reference limits and widths of reference
intervals (RIs) calculated by six procedures and evaluate a protocol for merging 
intrainstitutional reference data.
Methods: The differences between reference limits were compared with "optimal"
bias goals. Also, widths of the RIs were compared. RIs were calculated using
Mayo-SAS quantile, EP Evaluator, and four International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine methods: parametric and nonparametric (NP) with
and without latent abnormal values exclusion (LAVE). Regression parameters from
cotested samples were evaluated for harmonizing intrainstitutional reference
data.
Results: Mayo-SAS quintile, LAVE(-)NP, and EP Evaluator generated similar RIs,
but these RIs often were wider than RIs from parametric procedures. LAVE
procedures generated narrower RIs for nutritional and inflammatory markers.
Transformation with regression parameters did not ensure homogeneity of merged
data.
Conclusions: Parametric methods are recommended when inappropriate values cannot 
be excluded. The nonparametric procedures may generate wider RIs. Data sets
larger than 200 are recommended for robust estimates. Caution should be exercised
when merging intrainstitutional data.

University , Mugla , Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: The aim is to obtain normal newborn umbilical cord diameters for
use it in the evaluation of congenital umbilical hernia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The umbilical cord diameter (UCD) at the abdominal wall,
maternal age, birth weight, gestational age at birth, birth height, head, chest
and abdominal circumferences, and the time of measurement after birth was noted.
RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation and median (minimum-maximum) values of the UCD
were 9.9 ± 1.9 mm, 10.0 (5-16 mm), respectively. There was a significance for a
positive low correlation between birth height and UCD (p = .039, r = .143). No
other birth parameter had a significant correlation with UCD. The gender of the
newborn (p = .95) and the type of delivery (p = .056) did not affect UCD.
CONCLUSION: These data may be used in determining the normality of UCD, which
could be helpful in the evaluation of umbilical hernias.

BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal
malignancy. Hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, are expressed in the
majority of ccRCC. Targeting immune checkpoints with the blockade of PD-1 and its
ligand PD-L1 reorganizes T-cell activity in tumor microenvironment and provides
important antitumor responses. PD-L1 upregulation has been found to be
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) dependent. Our aim is to demonstrate the
association between PD-L1 and HIF expression and to reveal the role of PD-L1 in
prognosis and its association with tumor microenvironment.
METHODS: Surgical specimens from 145 patients diagnosed with ccRCC, who had
undergone radical or partial nephrectomy, were retrospectively analyzed.
Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMA) was performed to demonstrate
expressions of PD-L1, HIF-1α, and HIF-2α in tumor cells and PD-1, CD4, and CD8 in
lymphocytes to assess lymphocyte density in tumor microenvironment.
RESULTS: PD-L1 tumor cell expression was detected in 20/125 (13.8%) cases, which 
correlated with higher levels of PD-1, CD4, CD8 and HIF-2α expression. Low or
high expression of HIF-1α was similar in PD-L1-positive cases. When
PD-L1-positive cases were compared with negative ones, there was no significant
difference in terms of prognostic factors. However, the number of WHO/ISUP grade 
3-4 tumors was significantly higher in PD-L1-positive cases than in negative
ones.
CONCLUSION: PD-L1 tumor cell expression is strongly associated with increased
HIF-2α expression and presence of dense lymphocytic infiltration in ccRCCs. Our
findings confirm that PD-L1 positivity is associated with high ISUP nucleolar
grade. The association between PD-L1, HIF, and lymphocyte density in tumor
microenvironment must be clarified and especially taken into account in
combination treatment.

Chemotherapeutic agents are not very effective in treating advanced endometrial
cancers (ECs). Recent studies have demonstrated the immune evasion mechanism of
tumors and possible remedies. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are immunomodulator
molecules that have been the focus of research in lung cancer, melanoma, and
renal cell cancer. However, there are few studies concerning EC. This
retrospective study aimed to determine PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 expression
immunohistochemically in EC, and to study their correlation with
clinicopathologic tumor characteristics. This study comprised 127 patients with
EC. Anti PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 antibodies were examined immunohistochemically on
sections obtained from tissue microarray paraffin blocks. No staining with PD-1
in tumor cells was seen; however, we found positive staining in tumor cells at
36.2% with PD-L1 and 64.4% with PD-L2, and at 61.6% with PD-1, 36.2% with PD-L1, 
and 93.2% with PD-L2 in immune cells. When comparing staining and
clinicopathologic findings , most of the PD-L1 negative tumors (both in tumor and
immune cells) were FIGO Stage I, which was significantly higher than stage
II-III-IV tumors (P<0.05). There was a statistically significant association
between the FIGO grade and the PD-L1 score in immune cells (P=0.009), and between
staining of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and age (P=0.004, 0.013, and 0.043,
respectively). Interaction between PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 may be a potential
target for immunotherapy in elderly and advanced stage EC patients.

Intraepithelial lymphocytosis (IELosis) with or without villous abnormality is a 
characteristic feature of gluten sensitivity (GS) including celiac disease (CD)
and non-celiac-GS, although various conditions may also be associated with
IELosis. In order to distinguish GS from the other causes of IELosis, a threshold
for IEL counts is necessary. We aimed to determine a cut-off value for IELs and
monitor its value in the spectrum of GS in a large cohort. For this purpose, the 
duodenal biopsies from four groups of individuals including Types 1 (n = 88) and 
3 (n = 92) CD, non-CD IELosis (n = 112), and control (n = 82) cases, all strictly
defined by their clinical, laboratory, and serologic features, were evaluated.
The number of IELs/100 enterocytes and their distribution pattern on H&E- and
CD3-immunostained sections were assessed for each group. Kruskal-Wallis test and 
ROC curve analysis for discriminant value were employed for statistics. The IEL
counts showed an increasing trend through the spectrum of mucosal pathology
including controls (12.06; 21.40), non-CD IELosis (28.62; 39.46), Type 1 CD
(49.27; 60.15), and Type 3 CD (58.53; 71.74) both on H&E- and CD3-immunostained
sections, respectively (p < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed 20.5 on H&E and 28.5 on
CD3 as the IEL cut-off values with a sensitivity of 95.9 and 87.7% and a
specificity of 98.8% and 93.9%, respectively, for controls. IELs showed a diffuse
distribution pattern per biopsy piece and per villus (90.9%, 100%, respectively) 
in nearly all of Type 1 CD cases (p < 0.001). An IEL cut-off value of 20.5 on H&E
together with a diffuse distribution pattern seem to be the most discriminant
features for the diagnosis of CD, even for the milder forms of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to examine the influence of smoke exposure of
variable duration on the ultrastructure of and histopathologic and morphologic
alterations in the olfactory epithelium.
METHODS: A total of 24 Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to three groups 
and fed a standard rat chow and tap water. Experimental rats in groups I and II
were exposed to cigarette smoke in a glass cabin over a period of 2 months for 5 
or 15 min, respectively, four times daily; control rats (group III) were not
exposed to cigarette smoke. After dissection, all tissue specimens were processed
using routine procedures for TEM.
RESULTS: Groups I and II exhibited the presence of intraepithelial inflammatory
cells and especially deep invaginations in the nuclear membrane of supporting
cells. Extended intercellular spaces, cytoplasmic protrusions on the apical
surface of supporting cells, atrophy of microvilli and olfactory neuron cilia as 
well as numerous electron-dense granular structures and lysosome-like structures 
were observed to an increasing degree from group I to group II. Particularly in
group II, both supporting cells and olfactory neurons exhibited a cytoplasmic
edema, mitochondrial degeneration, and numerous vacuolar structures, as well as
apoptotic and minimal necrotic changes. In this group, hyperplasia of basal cells
was also observed.
CONCLUSION: Our electron microscopic findings show that cigarette smoke leads to 
toxic degenerative changes in the rat olfactory mucosa.

This experiment evaluated Panduratin A (PA), a chalcone isolated from
Boesenbergia rotunda rhizomes, for its hepatoprotectivity. Rats were subjected to
liver damage induced by intra-peritoneal injection of thioacetamide (TAA). PA was
tested first for its acute toxicity and then administered by oral gavage at doses
5, 10, and 50 mg/kg to rats. At the end of the 8th week, livers from all rats
were excised and evaluated ex vivo. Measurements included alkaline phosphatase
(AP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl
transferase (GGT), serum platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming
growth factor (TGF-β1), and hepatic metalloproteinase enzyme (MMP-2) and its
inhibitor extracellular matrix protein (TIMP-1). Oxidative stress was measured by
liver malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrotyrosine levels, urinary 8-hydroxy 2-
deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), and hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities. The
immunohistochemistry of TGF-β1 was additionally performed. PA revealed safe dose 
of 250 mg/kg on experimental rats and positive effect on the liver. The results
suggested reduced hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activity as verified from the
attenuation of serum PDGF and TGF-β1, hepatic MMP-2 and TIMP-1, and oxidative
stress. The extensive data altogether conclude that PA treatment could protect
the liver from the progression of cirrhosis through a possible mechanism
inhibiting HSCs activity.

BACKGROUND: In 2016, the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology (PSC) issued a new
classification scheme for respiratory cytology. We aim to evaluate our samples
according to this classification and to assess risk of malignancy and diagnostic 
yield of different cytological modalities.
METHODS: Respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchial wash/brush, BAL and FNA)
obtained between 2007 and 2016 were reclassified according to PSC guidelines.
Risk of malignancy for each diagnostic category was determined. Diagnostic yield 
was evaluated based on three-categorical approach.
RESULTS: One thousand, two hundred and ninety respiratory specimens were
retrieved, of which 280 had histologic follow-up. Samples were reclassified as
nondiagnostic 16%, negative for malignancy 53%, atypical 5.4%, neoplastic (benign
neoplasm/low-grade carcinoma) 0.4%, suspicious for malignancy 2.1% and malignant 
23.1%. Risk of malignancy for each category was 64.01% for ND, 48.27% for NM,
59.09% for A, 100% for N-B-LG; 90% for SM and 89.74% for M. When only malignant
cases were considered positive tests, cytology sensitivity was 55% and
specificity 88%.
CONCLUSION: Our results were in line with PSC guidelines, but the use of multiple
cytological techniques may cause some discrepancies in overall diagnostic yield
and in estimated risks of malignancy, which is important due to the widespread
utilization of different cytological procedures.

Gallbladder dysplasia can progress to cancer and may be associated with increased
cancer risk at other biliary tract sites. Thus, its accurate identification is
relevant both for etiologic understanding and for clinical purposes. Data on the 
frequency and distribution of gallbladder dysplasia are lacking owing to limited 
gallbladder sampling and inability to visualize dysplasia grossly. An expert
pathology group used consensus criteria to review 140 totally sampled consecutive
cholecystectomy specimens from Chilean women. Three cases (2%) revealed
incidental invasive carcinoma, all T2, along with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). The
surface areas covered by dysplasia or cancer in these cases were 9%, 37%, and
87%. Although the first longitudinal ("diagnostic") section of the whole
gallbladder captured HGD or cancer in all 3 cases, the deepest focus of invasive 
carcinoma was not present in this section. Fourteen additional cases (10%) had
low-grade dysplasia (LGD), which was typically very focal (covering <5% of the
surface) and most often occurred in the fundus. LGD was not present in the
diagnostic section of 5 cases (38%) and would have been missed without additional
sampling. None of the cancers or dysplasias were grossly visible. Although HGD
and carcinoma are likely to be identified in "diagnostic" sections, accurate
staging requires total sampling. LGD is typically very focal and would often be
missed in routine practice. To identify cancer precursors, additional sampling,
particularly of the fundus, may be warranted. The predominance of LGD in the
fundus also provides etiologic insight, supporting the contribution of gallstones
and chronic inflammation.

BACKGROUND: To assess the prognostic importance of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX),
a hypoxic biomarker, after neoadjuvant treatment in Stage III non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients.
METHODS: Tissue CA IX expression was examined after surgical resection in 77
patients who had undergone neoadjuvant treatment. The effects of CA IX
overexpression and other clinical factors on disease-free survival and overall
survival were investigated.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT)
courses and gender emerged as significant independent predictors for disease-free
survival, where administration of 2-3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT)
(HR, 3.2 [95% CI 1.3-7.6], p = 0.009) and female gender were associated with poor
survival (HR, 3.2 [95% CI 1.3-7.7], p = 0.009). The only significant independent 
predictor for overall survival was recurrence (HR, 5.6 [95% CI 2.4-12.8],
p < 0.001). On the other hand, CA IX overexpression was not associated with
disease free survival (p = 0.560) or overall survival (p = 0.799).
DISCUSSION: Our results do not suggest a prognostic role for CA IX overexpression
in stage III NSCLC patients who received neoadjuvant treatment.

Laminin receptor 1 may have a role in the progression from endometrial
hyperplasia with or without atypia to endometrial cancer. Therefore, we aimed to 
investigate the pattern, percentage, and intensity of laminin receptor 1
expression in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic endometrium. Paraffin blocks
of 131 specimens with the diagnoses of normal endometrium (n=25), endometrial
hyperplasia with atypia (n=21) or without atypia (n=55), and endometrial cancer
(n=30) were immunostained with laminin receptor 1 antibody, and its expression
percentage, pattern, and intensity in the epithelial cytoplasm, basement
membrane, and endometrial stroma of these tissues were assessed. When compared
with hyperplasia with or without atypia and endometrial cancer, the percentage of
nonstaining with laminin receptor 1 in the epithelial basement membrane was
higher (96%), and the percentage of <50% staining with laminin receptor 1 was
lower (4%) in the normal endometrium (P=0.001). While a progressive increment in 
staining percentage and density of epithelial cytoplasm and basement membrane was
noted through an orderly progression from normal endometrium to endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia, endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, and cancer of
endometrium (P<0.001), such a relationship was not found for the staining
percentage and density of endometrial stroma (P>0.05). Disease
progression-related gradual increment in laminin receptor 1 expression in the
epithelial basement membranes of hyperplastic endometrium with or without atypia 
and cancer of endometrium reveals that it may play a substantial role in the
transition from premalignant to the malignant state endometrial lesions.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we retrospectively evaluated cases of patients who had
undergone appendectomy in our hospital and aimed to present the efficiency of
diagnostic tests and demographic data of cases. Pathological reports were
analyzed for the following parameters: age, gender, and pathological diagnosis.
In addition, the demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients
with unusual histopathologic findings were evaluated in detail, and reanalysis of
archived resected appendix specimens was carried out.
METHODS: Files of 2047 patients (1329 males, 718 females, sex ratio: 1.85, age
range: 1-87 years, mean age: 26, 50 years), who had been operated with a
diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the emergency department of Bezmialem Vakıf
University Medical Faculty from November 2011 to June 2014, were retrospectively 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Cases were separated into 2 groups. Cases with histopathologic
examination reported as acute appendicitis constituted group 1 (n = 2013,
98.34%), and cases with pathologic findings other than acute appendicitis
constituted group 2 (n = 34, 1.66%). The second group consisted of 8 low-grade
mucinous neoplasms, 7 mucoceles, 6 carcinoid, 5 granulomatous inflammation, 4
intraluminal Enterobius vermicularis, 1 endometriosis externa, 1 adenocarcinoma
infiltrated to serosa, 1 mesenteric cyst, and 1 low-grade adenocarcinoma formed
in mucinous cystic neoplasm background.
CONCLUSION: Acute appendicitis is the most common emergency surgical condition.
Although most of the resected appendectomy specimens showed typical
histopathologic findings, some (1.66%) showed unusual histopathologic findings.
Even if the macroscopic appearance of the specimen is normal or acute
appendicitis, we suggest routine histopathological examination.

Juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) is a rare benign tumor of the craniofacial bones
differing from other fibro-osseous lesions in terms of early age of onset,
aggressive clinical behavior, and high recurrence rate. Histopathologically, it
is divided into two as trabecular JOF (TrJOF) and psammomatoid JOF (PsJOF). In
PsJOF, psammoma-like spherical ossicles constitute pathognomonic
histopathological images, whereas TrJOF has trabeculae of fibrillary osteoid and 
woven bone. Despite the histopathologic separation, both lesions have similar
clinical behavior, thus the treatment procedure is also the same. Complete
surgical resection is preferred for the treatment. We report a rare case of PsJOF
involving the maxillary sinus and resultant facial symmetry in a 13-year-old
female child.

Background: Mucins may show aberrant expression, localization, and/or
glycosylation in multiple malignancies. However, information regarding expression
of these mucins is mostly unknown in urothelial tumors.
Aim: This study was conducted for examining the expressions of membrane
associated and secreted mucin (MUC1) and a secreted gel-forming mucin (MUC2) in
urothelial tumors of the urinary bladder.
Subjects and Methods: Archival transurethral resection materials of 97 urothelial
carcinoma cases were reexamined light microscopically and graded according to the
2004 WHO Classification. Pathological stage was given as pTa, pT1, and pT2.
Demonstrative sections were recut for immunohistochemistry for MUC1 and MUC2. The
results were statistically analyzed, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results: The positivity for MUC1 and MUC2 was 89.7% and 44.3%, respectively.
Independent from pathological stage of the tumor, MUC1 expression showed
statistically significant correlation with tumor grade (P < 0.05). We did not
find any correlation between pathological stage and MUC1 and MUC2 expression (P >
0.05). MUC1 staining pattern in papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant
potential cases was more commonly apical and superficial (luminal cell layer
only). Intermediate cells ± basal cells or isolated cells or islands of tumor
cells with cytoplasmic and/or circumferential membrane positivity for MUC1 and
MUC2 were more commonly observed in both low- and high-grade carcinomas. The
difference between groups in terms of MUC1 and MUC2 staining was statistically
significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: The staining patterns of both mucins are different between
urothelial papillary tumors and may be used to make a differentiation, especially
for low-grade papillary urothelial lesions. This difference may also be important
in the carcinomatous transformation of urothelial neoplastic and preneoplastic
lesions.

molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2-positive, triple-negative) of breast cancer.

Turkey.

Background/Aims: Human epididymal secretory protein 4 (HE4) is originally
described as an epididymis-specific protein but more recently suggested to be a
putative serum tumor marker for some tumors, including breast carcinomas. In this
study, we aimed to investigate the interactions between HE4 expression and
molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas.
Methods: HE4 expressions were studied in 242 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
breast carcinoma specimens and their association with different pathological and 
clinical parameters was evaluated.
Results: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HE4 was negative in 3 (1.2%)
cases, weakly positive (1+) in 7 (2.9%) cases, moderately positive (2+) in 58
(24.0%) cases, and strongly positive (3+) in 174 (71.9%) cases. A correlation
between IHC HE4 staining grade and molecular groups was detected (P = 0.005).
Furthermore, it was found that HE4 expression was strongly associated with
histological tumor grade, c-erbB2 expression, and positive fluorescence in situ
hybridization test results that detect human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)/neu amplification (P = 0.022, P = 0.014, and P = 0.011).
Conclusion: This study showed that HE4 expression is associated with HER2/neu
amplification in breast cancers. These results may be commented as HE4 expression
rises in patients with HER2/neu amplification. As is known, HER2/neu
amplification is a poor diagnostic factor in breast cancer and HE4 expression is 
possibly associated with poor prognosis.

Background: Investigation of morphological differences in relation with
serological variables between primary versus secondary Sjögren's syndrome
associated with systemic scleroderma (Scl-SS).
Materials and Methods: A total of 69 primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and Scl-SS 
patients were grouped according to the American-European Consensus Group
criteria. Serum autoantibody information was obtained from the patient records.
Hematoxylin and eosin sections of the minor salivary gland biopsy were
reevaluated, and the lymphocyte focus score (FS), plasma cell focus, and fibrosis
rates were all evaluated.
Results: There were 43 pSS and 26 Scl-SS cases. Both biopsy and autoantibody were
positive in 16 pSS cases while only biopsy was positive in 25 cases and only
antibody in 1 case. Both biopsy and antibody were positive in 5 Scl-SS cases
while only biopsy was positive in 18 and only antibody in 3 cases. The plasma
cell focus was statistically significantly higher in pSS cases (P = 0.003). No
difference was seen between Sjögren' syndrome (SS) subtypes in terms of
lymphocyte FS, fibrosis, and autoantibody positivity.
Conclusion: We found that plasma cell focuses could be found more frequently in
pSS than Scl-SS. In addition, our study reveals that the coexistence of SS and
systemic scleroderma decreases the incidence of FS value ≥1 compared to pSS.

Specific or nonspecific findings of sexual abuse may be observed upon examination
of a child. Examination of the genital area is extremely important for the
identification of child sexual abuse (CSA). However, medical conditions detected 
in the child's genital area may be misinterpreted as signs of CSA. Herein, we
present a case of a child with suspected CSA who was treated in the intensive
care unit. The following incidental findings were obtained upon anal examination:
dilatation, ecchymosis, laceration, and hemorrhage. This report aims to discuss
the anal examination findings that can mimic CSA.

The identification of prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) represents an area of increasing interest. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), a
hypoxia marker, correlates with tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. 
However, the role of CA-IX in GBM remains largely unknown. In the present study, 
we evaluated the prognostic role of CA-IX in GBM patients. In total, 66
consecutive patients with GBM who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy and
adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide were retrospectively reviewed, and all
patients received temozolomide chemotherapy for at least 3 months. Kaplan-Meier
curves and log-rank tests were used for analysis of progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS), and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model
was employed to identify factors with an independent effect on survival. The
median OS was longer in patients with low levels of CA-IX expression (18 months) 
compared to patients overexpressing CA-IX (9 months) (P = 0.004). There was not a
statistically significant difference in median PFS (3.5 vs. 8 months, P = 0.054) 
between patients with high or low levels of CA-IX expression. In multivariate
analysis, the variables that were identified as significant prognostic factors
for OS were preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score (KPS) (hazard ratio
(HR), 3.703; P = 0.001), CA-IX overexpression (HR, 1.967; P = 0.019), and
incomplete adjuvant temozolomide treatment (HR, 2.241; P = 0.003) and gross-total
resection (HR, 1.956; P = 0.034). Our findings indicated that CA-IX may be a
potential prognostic biomarker in the treatment of GBM.

Author information: 
(1)1 Istanbul Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Trichoblastoma (TB) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are 2 different
neoplasms composed of basaloid cells and have overlapping histopathological
features. We compared the immunoexpression of CD10, T-cell death-associated gene 
51 (TDAG51), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), androgen receptor (AR), insulinoma-associated
protein 1 (INSM1), and nestin for the differential diagnosis of these tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed a total of 27 BCC and 27 TB cases, including 4
TB lesions in nevus sebaceous and 3 malignant TB lesions for CD10, TDAG51, CK20, 
AR, INSM1, and nestin expression.
RESULTS: Staining for CK20, TDAG51, INSM1, and stromal CD10 was significantly
more common in TB cases than in BCC cases ( P < .001). Epithelial CD10 and AR
staining was significantly more common in BCC cases than in TB cases ( P < .001).
The difference between the groups for nestin staining was not significant ( P >
.05). Stromal CD10 staining was the most sensitive marker (96.3%) and INSM1 the
least sensitive (55.6%) marker for TB. TDAG51 showed 100% specificity for TB. A
larger number of CK20 positive cells was found in the cases associated with nevus
sebaceous than in the other TBs.
CONCLUSION: All the selected markers except nestin were useful for the
differential diagnosis between TB and BCC. CD10 and TDAG51 were more useful than 
the other markers. The use of CK20 could be preferred in nevus sebaceous lesions.
INSM1 was less effective in highlighting Merkel cells within the lesion than
CK20.

Androgen receptor (AR) expression is an emerging prognostic marker that has been 
observed in 25% to 75% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) that lack
estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 overexpression. TNBCs are
treated with AR-targeted therapies and standardized evaluation of AR expression
may help guide patient management. Basal-like TNBCs are a subgroup of TNBCs
defined by positive immunoreactivity for CK5/6 or EGFR that carry a worse
prognosis. However, it's unclear whether basal-like TNBCs have a different rate
of AR positivity or if AR expression is predictive of disease-free survival (DFS)
in this patient group. Here, we examined a total of 185 TNBCs for AR and CK5/6
using tissue microarrays (TMAs). Among all samples, 32% were AR positive using a 
1% cutoff, and 24% were AR positive using a 10% cutoff. Ninety (49%) TNBCs were
CK5/6 positive with lower intensity of AR expression compared to CK5/6-negative
cases. There was no significant difference in pathologic stage, tumor size,
histologic grade and type, or lymph node stage after stratifying by AR and CK5/6 
positivity. AR-positive TNBCs had better overall survival (OS) and DFS compared
to AR-negative TNBCs. In addition, increased AR expression carried a
dose-dependent effect on DFS. AR expression, nodal status and tumor size were
significant predictors of disease-free and overall survival in a multivariable
model adjusted for CK5/6 expression, age, histologic grade, and mitotic rate. In 
conclusion, our data demonstrated that AR positivity is a favorable prognostic
factor for triple-negative breast cancers.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. Complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) has long been considered as a crucial step for metastasis initiation. It
has, however, become apparent that many carcinoma cells can metastasize without
complete loss of epithelial traits or with incomplete gain of mesenchymal traits,
i.e., partial EMT. Here, we aimed to determine the similarities and differences
between complete and partial EMT through over-expression of the EMT-associated
transcription factor Slug in different HCC-derived cell lines.
METHODS: Slug over-expressing HCC-derived HepG2 and Huh7 cells were assessed for 
their EMT, chemo-resistance and stemness features using Western blotting,
qRT-PCR, neutral red uptake, doxorubicin accumulation and scratch wound healing
assays. We also collected conditioned media from Slug over-expressing HCC cells
and analyzed its exosomal protein content for the presence of chemo-resistance
and partial EMT markers using MALDI-TOF/TOF and ELISA assays, respectively.
RESULTS: We found that Slug over-expression resulted in the induction of both
complete and partial EMT in the different HCC-derived cell lines tested. Complete
EMT was characterized by downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of ZEB2.
Partial EMT was characterized by upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of
vimentin and ZEB2. Interestingly, we found that Slug induced chemo-resistance
through downregulation of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 and
upregulation of the ABC transporter ABCG2, as well as through expression of
CD133, a stemness marker that exhibited a similar expression pattern in cells
with either a complete or a partial EMT phenotype. In addition, we found that
Slug-mediated partial EMT was associated with enhanced exosomal secretion of
post-translationally modified fibronectin 1 (FN1), collagen type II alpha 1
(COL2A1) and native fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG).
CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that the exosomal proteins identified may 
be considered as potential non-invasive biomarkers for chemo-resistance and
partial EMT in HCC.

The hematolymphoid infiltrations are challenging lesions in endocrine organs and 
tissues. The fourth edition of WHO classification of tumors of endocrine organs
and the fourth edition of WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and
lymphoid tissues are recently published. The updates in both fields include some 
new disease descriptions and prognostic markers. Our aim in this review article
is to give practical diagnostic information about the most frequently seen
hematolymphoid involvements of the pituitary gland, thyroid, and adrenal tissue. 
We designed the text in the order of organs and the contents according to the
disease frequency. The pituitary gland and cellar region are the most frequently 
involved with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although it is very rare,
Erdheim-Chester disease has recently been included in the classification and
still needs more clear diagnostic definitions. Lymphoproliferative thyroid
lesions and presentations create diagnostic problems for the pathologists.
IGG4-related disease and its relation with thyroiditis is a new concept. There
are many unknowns on pathobiology of the disease spectrum and discussion on
defined diagnostic criteria of the IGG4-related thyroid diseases. The overlapping
features of thyroiditis and primary thyroid lymphomas also create diagnostic
difficulties. The frequently recognized primary hematolymphoid lesions of the
endocrine organs may not be difficult to diagnose since they are expected
lesions. The secondary involvement of hematolymphoid neoplasia may be more
difficult to diagnose for an endocrine pathologist. In this review article, we
aim to give brief description of the diseases and practical diagnostic approach
by using optimum markers guided by the latest WHO classifications.

Objective: Elevated serum Mac 2-binding protein (M2BP) levels have been observed 
in some cancers. As far as we know, its importance has not been investigated in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The investigated problem of this study
was to evaluate whether there was a difference between ESCC patients and the
control group in terms of M2BP. Also, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of 
serum M2BP alone or in combination with the CEA for patients with ESCC.
Material and Methods: Blood serum samples were collected from 50 healthy donors
and 150 patients with ESCC. M2BP levels of all 200 samples were quantified by
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Patients who had been diagnosed with
ESCC and did not have any other malignancies were enrolled to study.
Results: The two groups did not significantly differ in terms of age (p > 0.05). 
In the control group, the mean serum M2BP level was 14.97 ± 3.46 ng/mL. The mean 
serum M2BP level of the ESCC patients was 176.65 ± 22.14 ng/mL. The serum M2BP
level was significantly higher in patients with ESCC than in the control group (p
< 0.001). Gender was also comparable in both groups (p = 0.695).
Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrated that this marker may be associated with
the mechanism of the disease. Despite that serum M2BP is not a specific marker
for ESCC, it can be used as an adjuvant biomarker for the diagnosis of ESCC.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) within tailgut cysts (TC) are usually
seen in middle-aged females. A 14 year-old boy who underwent surgical excision of
NET within TC is presented to discuss the clinical features, diagnosis and
treatment options.
CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old boy with rectal bleeding and constipation had a 5 × 4 
cm mass detected upon rectal examination. The cystic mass was totally excised.
The histopathological evaluation revealed a low-grade NET within mucularis layer 
of the cyst showing a positive immunhistochemical staining for cytokeratin and
synaptophysin.
CONCLUSION: Although, the malignant transition of TC is commonly observed in
middle age females, males and children can also be affected. This is first report
of a pediatric TC with malignant transformation. Total surgical excision of cysts
is mandatory for local control of the disease and chemotherapy should be reserved
for the patients who have positive surgical margins.

INTRODUCTION: Isotretinoin, a synthetic derivative of vitamin A, is one of the
most potent human teratogens, and is mainly utilized for the treatment of severe 
recalcitrant nodular acne. Retinoic acid embryopathy is well defined in the
literature.
CASE REPORT: The mother was referred for a fetal posterior fossa abnormality,
first detected at 20 weeks of gestation. The mother used isotretinoin until
18 weeks gestation. Ultrasound examination revealed hypertelorism, cerebellar
hypoplasia, vermian agenesis, truncus arteriosus, anotia, thymic aplasia, corpus 
callosum hypoplasia. An intrauterine diagnosis of fetal retinoid syndrome was
confirmed by fetopsy after termination of pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: The typical findings of fetal retinoid syndrome can be visualized
with ultrasound in early second trimester.

coronary arteries. This review summarizes the molecular and cellular mechanisms
involved in the pathogenesis of coronary artery ectasia. Better identification of
the pathophysiologic steps will shed light into the clinical significance and may
have direct implications for the management strategies of this disease.
Additionally, understanding the underlying etiology may help to improve treatment
modalities specific to coronary artery ectasia.

AIMS: To evaluate the relationship between expression of myxovirus-resistance
protein A (MxA) protein on muscle biopsies by immunohistochemistry and disease
activity in juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients. Also, another aim was to
investigate whether the expression of MxA is related with myositis-specific
autoantibodies (MSA) status in JDM patients.
METHODS: 103 patients (median aged 6.3, interquartile range 0.5-15.9) enrolled in
the Juvenile Dermatomyositis Cohort and Biomarker Study (JDCBS). Muscle biopsies 
were stained with MxA and scored. Clinical data at initial presentation were
collected and autoantibodies were analysed. Multiple linear regression analysis
was performed to estimate the association between MxA expression on muscle fibres
and muscle disease activity, and MSA status.
RESULTS: Expression of MxA protein on JDM samples was identified in 61.2%. There 
was a significant association between MxA scores and Childhood Myositis
Assessment Scale (CMAS) (P = 0.002), and Manual Muscle Testing of Eight Muscles
(MMT8) (P = 0.026). CMAS and MMT8 scores were significantly lower in the group of
patients with strong MxA expression. MxA scores differed according to MSA
subgroups (P = 0.002). Patients with positive nuclear matrix protein 2
autoantibodies had strong MxA expression, whereas anti-melanoma
differentiation-associated gene 5 positive patients had no or weak MxA
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the significant association between level of MxA 
expression on muscle fibres and clinical measures of muscular disease activity in
JDM patients and MSA status. This confirms type I interferonopathies in muscle
fibres of JDM patients which could help with improving treatment outcome in JDM
patients and underscoring the distinct pathophysiological pathways in different
MSA status.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate fetuses of terminated pregnancies with oligo-or
anhydramnios (OAH) to further investigate the association between maternal
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms and fetal urinary tract
malformations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 16 pregnancies with OAH 
(with normal fetal karyotype) that were intentionally terminated before 22nd
gestational week. Fetal autopsy was performed in all cases. We evaluated cases
for presence of DNA methylation pathway-related gene polymorphisms.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that renal abnormalities and disorders exist in 75% of
the cases. Pulmonary system anomalies and single umbilical artery were the most
frequently observed associated abnormalities. Polymorphisms with known reduced
MTHFR activity were found in 81.8% (9/11) of the cases.Association between
urinary system abnormalities and polymorphisms with known reduced MTHFR activity 
was observed in 88.8% (8/9) of the cases.
CONCLUSION: Physicians should keep in mind that polymorphisms with known reduced 
MTHFR activity may be associated with urinary tract abnormalities and OAH.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) includes circulating DNA fragments, which can be obtained
from different human biological samples. cfDNA originates either from apoptotic
and/or necrotic cells or is actively secreted by cancer cells. As yet, a
quantification and size distribution assessment of seminal plasma cfDNA from
prostate cancer patients has never been assessed. To discover a novel, sensitive,
non-invasive biomarker of prostate cancer, through the fluorometric
quantification and the electrophoretic analysis of seminal cfDNA in prostate
cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. The concentration of seminal
plasma cfDNA in prostate cancer patients was 2243.67 ± 1758 ng/μl, compared to
57.7 ± 4.8 ng/μl in healthy individuals (p < 0.05). Electrophoresis sites
distribution patterns were different; ladder fragmentation was associated with
prostate cancer patients and apoptotic electrophoretic fragmentation with healthy
individuals. Human seminal fluid can be a valuable source of cfDNA in the setting
of liquid biopsy procedures for the identification of novel oncological
biomarkers. Seminal plasma cfDNA in prostate cancer patients is significantly
more concentrated than that of age-matched, healthy controls. Fluorometric
measurement and electrophoretic assessment allow a reliable quantification and
characterization of seminal plasma cfDNA, which can be used routinely in prostate
cancer screening programs.

The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, the presence of a mucinous
component, and signet ring cells are well-known criteria for identifying patients
at a high risk for recurrence and determining the therapeutic approach for
early-stage colon cancer (eCC). Nevertheless, recurrence can unexpectedly occur
in some eCC cases after surgical resection. The aims of the present study were to
evaluate the relation of dysregulated MACC1, c-MET, and NM23-H1 expression with
the histopathological features of tumors in recurrence formation in eCC cases. A 
total of 100 sporadic eCC patients without poor prognosis factors were evaluated 
in this study. The relationship between the altered expression of MACC1, c-MET,
and NM23-H1 and pathological microenvironmental features, including the presence 
of tumor budding and desmoplasia, were assessed. The primary outcomes, including 
5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were also measured.
Compared with nonrecurrent patients, the expression level of MACC1 was 8.27-fold 
higher, and NM23-H1 was 11.36-fold lower in patients with recurrence during the
5-year follow-up (p = 0.0345 and p = 0.0301, respectively). In addition, the
coexistence of high MACC1 and low NM23-H1 expression and tumor budding was
associated with short OS (p < 0.001). We suggest that the combination of reduced 
NM23-H1, induced MACC1, and the presence of tumor budding are promising
biomarkers for the prediction of recurrence and may aid the stratification of
patients with stage II colon cancer for adjuvant chemotherapy.

Treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a clinically challenging
problem due to intriguing clinical and pathologic features of TNBC and natural or
induced resistance to existing therapies. However, a great understanding of
features of TNBC particularly associated with BRCA mutations has led to the
development of different therapeutic approaches. Besides, identification of TNBC 
subtypes contribute to investigation of the underlying molecular differences and 
development of new strategies for the treatment of TNBC patients. In this review,
we discussed the definition and characteristic properties of TNBC. We summarized 
an up-to-date description of the reported clinical trials of novel targeted
strategies especially PARP inhibitors (PARPi) due to novel and highly potent for 
the treatment of TNBC. Additionally, we reviewed published studies which
investigated the prevalence and types of BRCA1/2 mutation in breast cancer
patients to assess and draw attention of association of BRCA status with TNBC.
Consequently, the definition subtype of TNBC has important predictive value for
the development of new therapeutic agents in the treatment of TNBC. Additionally,
the incidence and types of mutations in BRCA-related pathways may be affected by 
ethnic origin and contribute to the risk of developing TNBC.

AIM: A 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) is recommended for screening all
pregnant women for gestational diabetes mellitus. In this study, the effect of
GCT on the thiol/disulfide balance was investigated.
METHODS: One-hundred women that underwent a 50 g GCT at 24-28 weeks of gestation 
(63 positive and 37 negative results) were evaluated in terms of thiol/disulfide 
in serum samples at test hours 0 and 1.
RESULTS: Compared to the baseline values (hour 0), after the glucose load (hour
1), the thiol and native thiol/total thiol (p < 0.0001) of the GCT-positive women
were reduced whereas the values of glucose, disulfide, disulfide/native thiol,
disulfide/total thiol (p < 0.0001) and total thiol increased (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: In GCT-positive pregnant individuals, the glucose load increases
oxidative stress by changing the thiol/disulfide homeostasis. Such an effect is
not observed in healthy pregnancies.

Recent studies suggest that nerve growth factor (NGF) protects olfactory cells
and axons from injury in vitro. Eighteen Wistar-Albino rats randomly divided into
three groups: control group, diabetic group without NGF, and diabetic with NGF.
Intranasal NGF (6 µg/day) was administered over a 5-day period. At the end of
30 days, the olfactory epithelium (OE) of NGF-applied diabetic rats regenerated, 
the epithelium thickness was significantly higher, and caspase-3 expression was
not significantly different from the control. The current results demonstrate
that intranasally administered NGF significantly reversed OE morphological
changes in diabetes by decreasing diabetes-related cell death and inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Galectins are animal lectins that bind to surface glycoproteins
expressed at the fetal-maternal interface. The aim of this prospective
case-control study was to investigate the possible relationship between levels of
maternal serum galectin-7 and threatened abortion (TA) and to determine whether
serum galectin-7 had any prognostic value.
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between August 2014 and February
2015. Included in the study were 31 consecutive pregnant women who were
hospitalized for TA between 6 and 14 weeks of gestation and 33 healthy
gestational age matched pregnant women without any symptoms of miscarriage. Serum
galectin-7 levels were measured via ELISA.
RESULTS: The mean serum galectin-7 levels of the two groups were not
significantly different (31 TA patients: 2.84 ± 0.43 pg/mL, 33 controls: 2.785 ± 
0.32 pg/mL, p = 0.543). Six pregnancies in the TA group resulted in abortion
(19.4%).
CONCLUSION: Serum galectin-7 was not useful for predicting prognosis in TA.

Background: We aimed in our study to research the role of new cytokines such as
IL-35, IL-22, and IL-17 that may form a target for novel treatment approaches.
Methods: IL-10, IL-17, TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-22, and IL-35 serum levels of allergic
rhinitis (AR) patients were measured using ELISA method. Allergic sensitization
was demonstrated by the skin prick test. Patients only with olive tree
sensitivity were evaluated for seasonal AR (SAR). Patients only with mite
sensitivity were included in the study for perennial AR (PAR). AR clinic severity
was demonstrated by the nasal symptom scores (NSS).
Results: In total, 65 AR patients (patient group), having 31 PAR and 34 SAR
patients, and 31 healthy individuals (control group) participated in the study.
Cytokine levels between the patient group and the control group were compared;
IL-17 (p = 0.038), IL-22 (p = 0.001), and TGF-β (p = 0.031) were detected as high
in the patient group, and IFN-γ (p < 0.001) was detected as low in the patient
group. When correlation analysis was made between age, gender, prick test result,
NSS, AR duration, and cytokine levels in the patient group, a negative
correlation was detected only between IFN-γ (p = 0.032/r = -0.266) level and NSS.
Conclusions: Accompanied by the literature information, these results made us
think that T cell subgroups and cytokines have an important role in AR
immunopathogenesis. It is thought that future studies to be conducted relating to
this subject will form new targets in treatment.

Context: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is one of the most frequent epithelial tumors 
worldwide.
Aims: We aimed to investigate the protein expressions of caspase-8, p53, murine
double minute 2 (mdm2), and p14ARF in nonmuscle UCs and to correlate the findings
with clinicopathological characteristics.
Settings and Design: : A total of 50 patients who had pTa and pT1 tumors were
analyzed.
Subjects and Methods: The protein expressions of caspase-8, p53, mdm2, and p14ARF
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test was done using SPSS version 16.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results: Cytoplasmic caspase-8 expression was significantly higher in pT1 UCs
while nuclear caspase-8 expression was significantly higher in pTa UCs (P = 0.005
and P = 0.011, respectively). Cytoplasmic caspase-8 expression was also higher in
high-grade UCs (P = 0.035). The expression of p53, mdm2, and p14ARF was not also 
related with pathological stage or grade (P > 0.05 for all). The p14ARF
expression was related with nuclear caspase-8 expression in most of the patients.
Complete agreement among nonmuscle UCs for immunohistochemical expression of p14 
and nuclear caspase-8 was seen in 41 cases, and the pairwise kappa agreement
value was substantial (κ =0.614). The patients who had recurrence were positive
for both p53 and mdm2 or either p53 or mdm2 (P = 0.025).
Conclusions: These results suggested that the staining pattern of caspase-8 might
be helpful for determining of the stages in nonmuscle UC. It was also showed that
the expression status of p53 and mdm2 were related with the recurrence.

Aim: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have a prognostic value in breast
cancer (BC); however, because of the lack of standard evaluation methods, we
aimed to assess the interobserver agreement of stromal TILs (sTILs) and
intratumoral TILs (iTILs) as well as the effect of hot spot areas and molecular
subtyping on the overall agreement.
Methods: The study consisted of 121 haematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained
slides of invasive BC samples obtained from the pathology archives. The TIL
assessment was based on the International TIL Working Group recommendations for
the percentage of sTILs and was conducted by four pathologists. The percentage of
iTILs, the number of lymphocytes in hot spot areas (iTILs-HS), and the overall
interobserver agreement for the molecular subtypes were evaluated. The interclass
correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess interobserver agreement among
the four pathologists.
Results: : The ICC score among the observers for the sTIL percentages was 0.74,
and the individual ICC values for each molecular subtype were 0.55, 0.88, and
0.79 for luminal, HER2-positive, and triple-negative tumors, respectively. The
compliance value for the iTILs was 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) =
0.06-0.48], whereas the compliance value for the iTILs-HS was 0.63 (95% CI =
0.49-0.71). The compliance values for the iTILs-HS subtypes were 0.72, 0.43, and 
0.55 for luminal, HER2-positive, and triple-negative tumors, respectively.
Conclusion: The IWTILG recommendations are reproducible and reliable. The
interobserver agreement of the sTIL percentages was considerably higher for the
triple-negative and HER2-positive cases than the luminal cases, whereas the
interobserver agreement for the assessment of iTILs-HS in tumors was higher for
the luminal subtype.

BACKGROUND: Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a maturation defect characterized by
immature woven bones and stroma. However, especially in craniofacial bones,
lamellation can be seen and this is associated with the maturation.
AIM: To show maturation in FD and discuss the factors that may affect the
maturation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-five FD cases were divided into three subgroups
according to the lamellation percentage as Groups 1, 2 and 3 (low, moderate and
high lamellation, respectively). Each group was compared in terms of the
peritrabecular clefting (PTC), stromal cellularity and the age. The lesions under
pressure and the ones that are not were compared in terms of lamellation
percentage.
RESULTS: A significant statistical difference was found between Groups 1 and 3 in
terms of PTC, stromal cellularity, histologic pattern suggesting maturation
(p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggested a strong relation between lamellation and
maturation. Lamellation was more prominent in the bones under pressure than the
others. Considering lamellation as a finding of maturation, it is possible to
establish a relation between maturation and pressure. Therefore, future studies
should focus on the question if the pressure could be a factor for maturation and
it could be used for treating FD.

Primary breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine features (NEBC) is an uncommon
tumor. In the classification of WHO 2012, these tumors were categorized as: 1-
neuroendocrine tumor, well-differentiated; 2- neuroendocrine carcinoma, poorly
differentiated/small cell carcinoma; and 3- invasive breast carcinoma with
neuroendocrine differentiation. In this study, we reviewed NEBC except poorly
differentiated/small cell carcinoma variant in order to define the morphological 
growth patterns and cytonuclear details of these tumors. All breast surgical
excision materials between 2007 and 2016 were re-evaluated in terms of
neuroendocrine differentiation. Thirty-six cases showing positive staining for
synaptophysin and/or chromogranin A in ≥50% of tumor cells were included in the
study. All cases were female with a mean age of 67.4. Mean tumor diameter was
26 mm. Multifocality was noted in 5 cases. Grossly, they were mostly infiltrative
mass lesions. T stages, identified in 34 cases, were as follows: 13 cases with
pT1; 19 pT2 and 2 pT3. We described schematically 4 types of patterns depending
on predominant growth pattern, except one case: 1) Large-sized solid cohesive
groups (6 cases), 2) Small- to medium-sized solid cohesive groups with
trabeculae/ribbons and glandular structures (6 cases), 3) Mixed growth patterns
(20 cases), 4) Invasive tumor with prominent extracellular and/or intracellular
mucin (3 cases). The tumor cells were mostly polygonal-oval with
eosinophilic/eosinophilic-granular cytoplasm. The nuclei of tumor cells were
mostly round to oval with evenly distributed chromatin. Only 5 cases showed high 
grade nuclear and histological features. Molecular subtypes of the cases were as 
follows: 33 luminal A, 2 luminal B, and 1 triple negative. NEBC should come to
mind when a tumor display one of the morphological patterns described above,
composed of monotonous cells with mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism and
abundant eosinophilic/eosinophilic granular or clear cytoplasm, especially in
elderly patients.

Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of death in men and the fifth
common cause of death in women worldwide. Currently, available advanced imaging
modalities can predict R0 resection in most patients in the perioperative period.
The aim of this study is to determine the role of serum CK18, MMP-9, and TIMP1
levels in predicting R0 resection in patients with gastric cancer. Fifty
consecutive patients scheduled for curative surgery with gastric adenocancer
diagnosis between 2013 and 2015 were included in the study. One milliliter of
blood was taken from the patients included in the study to examine CK18, MMP-9,
and TIMP1. CK18, MMP-9, and TIMP1 levels were positively correlated with
pathological N and the stage (P < 0.05). The CK18, MMP-9, and TIMP1 averages of
those with positive clinical lymph nodes and those in clinical stage 3 were found
to be higher than the averages of those with negative clinical lymph nodes and
those in clinical stage 2 (P < 0.05). Although serum CK18, MMP-9, and TIMP1 preop
measurements in patients scheduled for curative surgery due to gastric
adenocarcinoma did not help to gain any idea of tumor resectability, we concluded
that our study had valuable results in significantly predicting N3 stage.

OBJECTIVE: There are no up-to-date records on head and neck masses (HNMs) in
Somalia. This cytological study is the first to demonstrate the benefits and
findings of fine-needle aspiration cytology in evaluating HNMs in the adult
population of Somalia.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 116 aspiration samples were taken from different levels 
of the neck region, except for the thyroid. Cases were classified as salivary
gland, lymph node, or soft tissue/cystic lesions. They were classified according 
to age, gender, and cytological diagnosis.
RESULTS: Patients included 54 (46.6%) males and 62 (53.4%) females, with a mean
age of 40.6 years. Seventy-two patients (62.1%) had benign lesions, while 44
(37.9%) had malignant lesions. Necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis (n = 51,
70.8% of the benign findings) and lymph node metastasis of squamous cell
carcinoma (n = 13, 29.5% of the malignant findings) were the most frequent
findings.
CONCLUSION: Fine-needle aspiration is a useful procedure in the diagnosis of neck
masses. It is a cheap and easy guiding method for diagnosing granulomatous
lymphadenitis and advanced-stage metastatic cancers, which are common in this
country.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as an important tool for
regenerative medicine and experimental treatments. Unveiling the ultrastructural 
changes during the differentiation of MSCs might help us to understand the nature
of the process and to develop novel therapeutic approaches. For this purpose,
human umbilical cord (hUC) was chosen as MSC source. In the first place, MSCs
were isolated from sub-amniotic, intervascular and perivascular areas of hUC by
enzymatic and tissue explant method to determine the most favorable region of hUC
and technique for further processing. Therefore, microscopic and growth kinetics 
analyses showed that there was no clear difference in the morphologies and
proliferation rates among the hUC-MSC groups. Flow cytometric analysis showed
that CD44 and CD90 MSC markers were highly expressed, while CD34 and CD45
hematopoietic stem cells markers were expressed at low degree. Because our
preliminary results showed that there was no conspicuous superiority among the
hUC-MSCs groups, whole UC was utilized as a source, and tissue explant method was
applied to isolate MSCs for further differentiation analysis. At the 1st and 3rd 
week of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, ultrastructural analysis
showed an increase in the number of secondary lysosomes in comparison with the
undifferentiated status. Increase in the mitochondrial content was also detected 
at the 1st week of adipogenic differentiation. Consequently, ultrastructural
changes including increase in the number of mitochondria and secondary lysosomes 
during the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation could be attributed to the
switch in energy metabolism of the MSCs and increment in the lysosomal activity
respectively.

Poorly differentiated chordomas are rare musculoskeletal tumors. Case 1. A
42-year-old lady presented with quadriparesis of 2 months' duration. Radiologic
imaging disclosed a soft tissue mass in her left prevertebral- and paravertebral 
cervical region. Case 2. A 4-year-old male child presented with neck pain and
restricted head movements of 1-year duration. Radiologic imaging revealed a
contrast enhancing, paraspinal soft tissue mass in his cervical region.
Microscopic examination in both the cases revealed a cellular malignant tumor
composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic cells with interspersed mitotic
figures, along with focal myxoid change and necrosis. By immunohistochemistry,
tumor cells in both cases were diffusely positive for pan cytokeratin (AE1/AE3)
and brachyury, whereas these were negative for INI1/SMARCB1. Tumor cells in the
second case were also positive for glypican3. The first case developed pulmonary 
metastasis, while the second case developed recurrence. Poorly differentiated
chordomas are uncommon tumors, invariably characterized by loss of INI1. These
tumors can be rarely seen in adults and need to be differentiated from their
diagnostic mimics, in view of treatment implications and their relatively
aggressive clinical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS)
is characterized by bladder distension without urinary tract obstruction,
decreased or absent intestinal peristalsis and microcolon. Although the
definitive cause remains unknown, changes in the ACTG2 gene are thought to be
responsible for the intestinal and bladder hypoperistalsis.
CASE REPORT: This female newborn with MMIHS had a c.532C>A /p.Arg178Ser
heterozygous de novo mutation detected in the ACTG2 gene. Normal immature
ganglion cells, normal calretinin punctate positivity, maintence of smooth muscle
actin immunoreactivity, and decreased numbers of interstitial cells of
Cajal(ICCs) were detected.
CONCLUSION: This previously unreported c.532C>A /p.Arg178Ser heterozygous de novo
mutation in the ACTG2 gene may lead to a severe form of MMIHS.

We aimed to investigate the expressions of p27 kinase inhibitory protein 1
(p27Kip1) and calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) in adenomas and normal parathyroid 
tissue and to evaluate the relationship of these molecules with clinical and
biochemical parameters in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Fifty-one patients 
with histopathologically confirmed parathyroid adenomas and 20 patients with
normal parathyroid glands (which were removed incidentally during thyroid
resection) were included. Immunohistochemical stainings of CaSR and p27Kip1 were 
performed in surgical specimens. Clinical features, biochemical parameters, and
BMD measurements of patients with PHPT were evaluated retrospectively.
Expressions of p27Kip1 and CaSR were decreased in parathyroid adenomas, compared 
to normal glands (p < 0.05). High intensity of CaSR staining (3+) was more
frequent in normal parathyroid tissue (75%) than adenomas (12%) (p < 0.01).
Hypertension was not observed in patients with high staining intensity of CaSR
(p = 0.032). There was a negative association between CaSR expression and body
mass index (BMI) (p = 0.027, r = - 0.313). There was no significant relationship 
between p27Kip1 and CaSR expressions, serum calcium, plasma parathormone,
25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, and bone density (p > 0.05). The expressions of
p27Kip1 and CaSR were decreased in PHPT patients. This reduction may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of PHPT. However, neither p27Kip1 nor CaSR
expression was found to be useful in predicting prognosis or severity of disease.

Background: As histopathological findings of parathyroid carcinoma are not
certain, the diagnosis of tumors with degenerative changes may be difficult. In
these cases, immunohistochemical markers are beneficial. We aimed to research the
acceptability of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), Galactin-3, Cyclin D1, and
Ki-67 as helpful markers in parathyroid tumors in cases which are difficult to
diagnose.
Materials and Methods: Those cases who had been diagnosed with atypical
parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid carcinoma between 2010 and 2015 were
reevaluated. İmmunohistochemical markers were applied to this cases.
Results: About 21 cases were parathyroid adenoma, 14 were atypical adenoma, and
10 cases were parathyroid carcinoma. According to the immunohistochemical
results, global loss of CaSR staining was seen in 50% (5/10) of the patients with
carcinoma while there was no loss of staining in those with parathyroid adenoma
(P = 0,001). Global loss of CaSR staining was found in only one out of 14 cases
with atypical adenoma. The expression of Galactin-3 was found to be positive in
40% (4/10) of carcinoma cases, 71.4% (10/14) of those with atypical adenoma, and 
14.3% (3/21) of those with adenoma (P = 0,002). Cyclin D1 expression was
determined to be positive in 70% (7/10) of patients with carcinoma, 71.4% (10/14)
of atypical adenoma cases, and 23.8% (5/21) of those with adenoma. The Ki-67
proliferation index was seen to be above 5% in 50% (5/10) of carcinoma cases and 
35,7% (5/14) of those with atypical adenoma.
Conclusion: In these studies, it has been emphasized that the global loss of CaSR
staining was used as a negative marker in the diagnosis of carcinoma. In this
study, we have also confirmed that the global loss of CaSR staining is a useful
marker to determine potential increased malignancy.

Evaluation of the osteopontin in oral peripheral and central giant cell
granuloma.

Aksakalli N(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Tumor Pathology, Istanbul University, Institute of Oncology,
Istanbul, Turkey.

Aim: Peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG) and central giant cell granuloma
(CGCG) of the jaws are benign proliferations of spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells 
and multinucleated giant cells. Despite the histopathologic similarities, they
have markedly different clinical behavior. PGCG shows low recurrence rate whereas
CGCG shows a variable clinical behavior ranging from nonaggressive lesions to
aggressive lesions characterizing by pain, rapid growth, and high recurrence
rate. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare CGCG with PGCG by
immunohistochemistry using Ki-67, osteopontin (OPN), and integrin αvantibodies.
Subjects and Methods: Twenty PGCG and 20 CGCG were selected for
immunohistochemical evaluation of OPN, integrin αv, and Ki-67 in multinucleated
giant cells and mononucleated cells of PGCG and CGCG.
Results: PGCG showed higher Ki-67 immunoreactivity in mononucleated cells
compared to CGCG (P < 0.05). There was no reactivity with Ki-67 in multinucleated
giant cells of both groups. Mononucleated cells in CGCGs demonstrated increased
OPN and integrin αvexpressions in comparison with PGCGs (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: The clinic behavior of CGCG being more aggressive than PGCG might be
explained by the high expression of OPN and integrin αv. Further studies are
necessary to evaluate the other OPN receptors and their role on the biologic
behavior of these lesions.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate a novel frozen section analysis technique during robot
assisted radical prostatectomy with 2 distinct advantages: evaluation of the
entire circumference and easier reconstruction for whole mount evaluation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Istanbul Preserve was performed on patients who underwent
robotic prostatectomy with nerve sparing between 10/2014 and 7/2016. Gland was
sectioned at 3-4mm intervals from apex to bladder neck. Entire tissue
representing margins (except for the most anterior portion) was circumferentially
excised and microscopically analyzed. In margin positivity, approach was
individualized based on extent of positive margin and Gleason pattern. A matched 
cohort was established for comparison. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively 
maintained database was performed. Impact of FSA on PSM rate was primarily
assessed.
RESULTS: Data on 170 patients was analyzed. Positive surgical margin was reported
in 56(33%) on frozen section. Neurovascular bundle was partially or totally
resected in 79% and 18%. Conversion of positive margin to negative was achieved
in 85%. Overall positive margin rate decreased from 22.5% to 7.5%. Nerve sparing 
increased from 87% to 93%. Location of positive margin at frozen was at the
neurovascular bundle area in 39%; thus Istanbul Preserve detected 61% additional 
margin positivity compared to other techniques. Reconstruction for whole mount
was easy.
CONCLUSION: Istanbul Preserve is a novel technique for intraoperative FSA during 
RARP allowing for microscopic examination of the entire prostate for margin
status and easy re-construction for whole mount examination. It guarantees safer 
margins together with increased rate of nerve sparing.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid nodules diagnosed as Bethesda category IV [follicular
neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN)] are recommended for
surgery. However, only 10%-40% of these nodules turn out to be malignant on
histopathological examination. Therefore, selection for surgery of nodules
diagnosed as Bethesda category IV is important. We aimed to define predictive
factors for malignancy and factors associated with triage to surgery.
METHODS: The records of all patients with nodules who underwent fine needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and classified by Bethesda reporting system as FN/SFN
between January 2011 and July 2017 at our institution were reviewed. Univariate
and multivariate analysis were performed to select independent factors associated
with thyroid cancer, and with triage to surgery. Using independent risk factors
for malignancy predictive index categories were created.
RESULTS: Among 6910 nodules that underwent FNAB, 180 (2.6%) were diagnosed as
FN/SFN. Of the 180 patients, 139 (77%) underwent surgery with the associated
malignancy rate of 37% (51/139) (upper boundary). Risk of malignancy among all
FN/SFN nodules was 28% (lower boundary). Solid structure, size ≥ 4 cm,
microcalcification, hypoechogenicity, and increased vascularization were found to
be significant and independent risk factors associated for malignancy. None of
the clinical and ultrasound factors were associated with triage to surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that using predictive factors for malignancy in 
the Bethesda IV category as risk indices, 17% of patients who had nodules without
any risk factors could be spared surgery. Predictive indices could be considered 
for the malignancy risk and for selection of patients for surgery.

BACKGROUND: ZEB2 is a transcriptional repressor that regulates
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through binding to bipartite E-box
motifs in gene regulatory regions. Despite the abundant presence of E-boxes
within the human genome and the multiplicity of pathophysiological processes
regulated during ZEB2-induced EMT, only a small fraction of ZEB2 targets has been
identified so far. Hence, we explored genome-wide ZEB2 binding by chromatin
immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) under endogenous ZEB2 expression
conditions.
METHODS: For ChIP-Seq we used an anti-ZEB2 monoclonal antibody, clone 6E5, in
SNU398 hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibiting a high endogenous ZEB2
expression. The ChIP-Seq targets were validated using ChIP-qPCR, whereas
ZEB2-dependent expression of target genes was assessed by RT-qPCR and Western
blotting in shRNA-mediated ZEB2 silenced SNU398 cells and doxycycline-induced
ZEB2 overexpressing colorectal carcinoma DLD1 cells. Changes in target gene
expression were also assessed using primary human tumor cDNA arrays in
conjunction with RT-qPCR. Additional differential expression and correlation
analyses were performed using expO and Human Protein Atlas datasets.
RESULTS: Over 500 ChIP-Seq positive genes were annotated, and intervals related
to these genes were found to include the ZEB2 binding motif CACCTG according to
TOMTOM motif analysis in the MEME Suite database. Assessment of ZEB2-dependent
expression of target genes in ZEB2-silenced SNU398 cells and ZEB2-induced DLD1
cells revealed that the GALNT3 gene serves as a ZEB2 target with the highest, but
inversely correlated, expression level. Remarkably, GALNT3 also exhibited the
highest enrichment in the ChIP-qPCR validation assays. Through the analyses of
primary tumor cDNA arrays and expO datasets a significant differential expression
and a significant inverse correlation between ZEB2 and GALNT3 expression were
detected in most of the tumors. We also explored ZEB2 and GALNT3 protein
expression using the Human Protein Atlas dataset and, again, observed an inverse 
correlation in all analyzed tumor types, except malignant melanoma. In contrast
to a generally negative or weak ZEB2 expression, we found that most tumor tissues
exhibited a strong or moderate GALNT3 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation that ZEB2 negatively regulates a GalNAc-transferase 
(GALNT3) that is involved in O-glycosylation adds another layer of complexity to 
the role of ZEB2 in cancer progression and metastasis. Proteins glycosylated by
GALNT3 may be exploited as novel diagnostics and/or therapeutic targets.

PURPOSE: One of the recently developed polyamine (PA) analogues, N 1
,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSpm), has been found to act as an apoptotic inducer
in melanoma, breast, prostate and colon cancer cells. Also, its potential to
induce autophagy has been established. Unfolded protein responses and starvation 
of amino acids are known to trigger autophagy. As yet, however, the molecular
mechanism underlying PA deficiency-induced autophagy is not fully clarified.
Here, we aimed to determine the apoptotic effect of DENSpm after autophagy
inhibition by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or siRNA-mediated Beclin-1 silencing in
colon cancer cells.
METHODS: The apoptotic effects of DENSpm after 3-MA treatment or Beclin-1
silencing were determined by PI and AnnexinV/PI staining in conjunction with flow
cytometry. Intracellular PA levels were measured by HPLC, whereas autophagy and
the expression profiles of PA key players were determined in HCT116, SW480 and
HT29 colon cancer cells by Western blotting.
RESULTS: We found that DENSpm-induced autophagy was inhibited by 3-MA treatment
and Beclin-1 silencing, and that apoptotic cell death was increased by PA
depletion and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) upregulation. We
also found that autophagy inhibition led to DENSpm-induced apoptosis through Atg5
down-regulation, p62 degradation and LC3 lipidation in both HCT116 and SW480
cells. p53 deficiency did not alter the response of the colon cancer cells to
DENSpm-induced apoptotic cell death under autophagy suppression conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: From our results we conclude that DENSpm-induced apoptotic cell
death is increased when autophagy is inhibited by 3-MA or Beclin-1 siRNA through 
PA depletion and PA catabolic activation in colon cancer cells, regardless p53
mutation status.

PURPOSE: Emerging evidence indicates that combining Sorafenib with vitamin K1
(VK1) may result in a synergistic inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
cell migration and proliferation. Despite this synergy, its benefits may be
limited due to drug resistance resulting from cross-talk with the tumor
microenvironment. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling acts as an
important modulator of HCC cell growth, motility and drug resistance. Therefore, 
we aimed to explore the effects of Sorafenib in combination with VK1 and/or
IGF1-R antagonists on HCC cells.
METHODS: Scratch wound migration assays were performed to assess the motility of 
HCC-derived PLC/PRF/5, HLF and Hep3B cells. The synergistic, additive or
antagonistic effects of Sorafenib, VK1 and IGF1-R antagonists on HCC cell
motility were assessed using CompuSyn software. The effects mediated by these
various compounds on HCC cytoskeleton organization were evaluated using DyLight
554 Phalloidin staining. Proliferation and migration-associated signaling
pathways were analyzed in PLC/PRF/5 cells using Erk1/2 and Akt activation kits
and Western blotting (Mek, JNK, Akt, Paxillin and p38), respectively.
RESULTS: The effects of the IGF1-R antagonists GSK1838705A and OSI-906 on HCC
cell migration inhibition after Sorafenib and/or VK1 administration, individually
or in combination, were evaluated. We found a synergistic effect in PLC/PRF/5,
HLF and Hep3B cells for combinations of fixed doses of GSK1838705A or OSI-906
together with different doses of Sorafenib and/or VK1. The levels of synergy were
found to be stronger at higher Sorafenib and/or VK1 concentrations and lower or
absent at lower concentrations, with some variation among the different cell
lines tested. In addition, we found that in PLC/PRF/5 and HLF cells IGF1-R
blockage strongly enhanced the reduction and redistribution of F-actin induced by
Sorafenib and/or VK1 through alterations in the phosphorylation levels of some of
the principal proteins involved in the MAPK signaling cascade, which is essential
for cell migration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that modulation of the efficacy of Sorafenib
through combinations with VK1 and/or IGF1-R antagonists results in synergistic
inhibition of HCC cell migration.

INTRODUCTION: Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is used for the diagnosis and treatment of 
several pulmonary diseases. Conventional smear and Liquid-based cytology (LBC)
methods are applied to cytology samples of various bronchoscopic techniques. If
the cytology sample is sufficient for evaluation, a cell block (CB) can be
prepared from the remaining material. The aim of this study is to identify the
diagnostic value of conventional smear, LBC and CB methods in bronchial
cytological specimens.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 329 samples from 240 patients was made and, of
these, 144 patients were found to have neoplasia. A blind review of the specimens
was performed and all were reclassified individually. The endoscopic findings of 
the 144 patients with neoplasia were analysed retrospectively. The cytological
diagnoses were then compared with the final diagnosis or the endoscopic findings 
of patients with neoplasia. The sensitivity was calculated for each method, both 
separately and together.
RESULTS: It was determined that CB led to a 10.1% increase in the diagnostic
sensitivity for bronchial aspiration (BA) specimens, while no significant
increase was seen in bronchial brush specimens. In BA specimens of neoplasia
patients with normal bronchoscopic findings, while three methods were applied
together with an increase in the number of cases diagnosed as malignant cytology,
there was no significant increase in bronchial brush specimens.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that adding cell block to CB and LBC seemed
to contribute the cytological diagnosis in BA materials significantly. Another
advantage of CB is the opportunity of applying advanced methods such as
immunocytochemical and molecular techniques.

Tumor deposits (TDs), identified in different types of carcinomas are associated 
with poor prognosis. Salivary gland tumors were evaluated for the first time for 
TDs in this series. Pathological and clinical features of 25 salivary gland
carcinomas primarily treated surgically including neck dissection were determined
and all cases were evaluated for TDs in dissection specimens. Seven patients
(28%) had TDs. There was no difference for TDs when histological type, tumor
grade, tumor localization, pT, pN stage, surgical margin, lymphovascular,
perineural invasion, local recurrence, distant metastatic disease and overall
survival were considered. Disease-free survival rates at 12 and 24 months were
52.5%, 28.6% and 73.3%, 57.1%, for cases with and without TDs (P = 0.463).
Overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months for these groups were 85.7% and 57.1
versus 86.7% and 66.7% respectively (P = 0.916). Mean estimated recurrence-free
survival time for all cases, TD negative and TD positive cases were: 171.86,
182.72 and 82.42 months, respectively. Mean estimated overall survival time for
these groups were 175.80, 186.489 and 89.70 months, respectively. TDs were
described in salivary gland tumors for the first time in this series and seem to 
be associated with poor prognosis requiring further evaluation in larger series.

Hydatidiform mole is an aberrant human pregnancy characterized by early embryonic
arrest and excessive trophoblastic proliferation. Recurrent hydatidiform moles
are defined by the occurrence of at least two hydatidiform moles in the same
patient. Fifty to eighty percent of patients with recurrent hydatidiform moles
have biallelic pathogenic variants in NLRP7 or KHDC3L. However, in the remaining 
patients, the genotypic types of the moles are unknown. We characterized 80 new
hydatidiform mole tissues, 57 of which were from patients with no mutations in
the known genes, and we reviewed the genotypes of a total of 123 molar tissues.
We also reviewed mutation analysis in 113 patients with recurrent hydatidiform
moles. While all hydatidiform moles from patients with biallelic NLRP7 or KHDC3L 
mutations are diploid biparental, we demonstrate that those from patients without
mutations are highly heterogeneous and only a small minority of them are diploid 
biparental (8%). The other mechanisms that were found to recur in patients
without mutations are diploid androgenetic monospermic (24%) and triploid
dispermic (32%); the remaining hydatidiform moles were misdiagnosed as moles due 
to errors in the analyses and/or their unusual mechanisms. We compared three
parameters of genetic susceptibility in patients with and without mutations and
show that patients without mutations are mostly from non-familial cases, have
fewer reproductive losses, and more live births. Our data demonstrate that
patients with recurrent hydatidiform moles and no mutations in the known genes
are, in general, different from those with mutations; they have a milder genetic 
susceptibility and/or a multifactorial etiology underlying their recurrent
hydatidiform moles. Categorizing these patients according to the genotypic types 
of their recurrent hydatidiform moles may facilitate the identification of novel 
genes for this entity.

BACKGROUND: According to the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical
Pathology (ASCCP), a co-test is recommended for patients one year after the
detection of non-HPV 16/18 viral types in association with a negative cervical
cytology. In this study, we used immediate colposcopy to evaluate the risks to
the patient during the one year waiting period.
METHODS: We included 544 Hpv-positive/cervical cytology-negative patients who
underwent cervical cancer screening from June 2015 to June 2017. Cytological
specimens were classified using the Bethesta method on a liquid based
preparation. We used the Hybrid Capture 2 system to define HPV DNA. Biopsies were
performed on all patients under colposcopy.
RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-five patients had HPV types 16/18 and 169 had 
non-HPV-16/18 oncogenic types. Of the 169 patients who had non-HPV-16/18
oncogenic types, 151 (89%) had no dysplasia, 16 (9.4%) had CIN 1, and 2 (1.1%)
had CIN 2/CIN 3.
CONCLUSION: For the patients who had cervical cytology negative/non-HPV-16/18
positive, we detected that 1.1% of these women had CIN 2-3. For this reason, by
chasing the algorithm recommended by guidelines, gynecologists take risk missing 
a diagnosis of CIN 2 plus lesion in 1.1% of patients.

Superficial acral fibromyxoma (SAFM) is an uncommon mesenchymal soft tissue tumor
with a predilection for the acral extremites and nail bed involvement. SAFM is
diagnosed with clinicopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Awareness
of this rare tumor is important because of amounts of benign and malignant
neoplasms. We report a case of SAFM in a rare localization in the heel with a new
finding on dermoscopy.

AIMS: We explored the relationships between programmed death-1 (PD-1) and
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and the pathological and clinical
features of thymic epithelial tumours and thymic hyperplasia.
METHODS: We evaluated PD-1 and PDL-1 expressions within epithelial and
microenvironmental components in thymic epithelial tumours (n=44) and thymic
hyperplasias (n=8), immunohistochemically. We compared the results with
demographic, clinical and histopathological features of the cases.
RESULTS: We found 48% epithelial expression and 82.7% microenvironment expression
for PD-1 and 11.5% epithelial expression and 34.6% microenvironment expression
for PD-L1. There was no PD-1 expression, in either the epithelial or
microenvironment, in the thymic hyperplasia group. PD-1 and PD-L1 positivity was 
more significant in thymic epithelial tumours than thymic hyperplasia. Patients
with PD-1-positive microenvironments exhibited significantly shorter mean
estimated survival time than their negative counterparts.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies may
benefit patients due to high release of PD-1 and PD-L1 in thymic epithelial
tumours.

Ameloblastoma is a mostly benign, but locally invasive odontogenic tumor
eliciting frequent relapses and significant morbidity. Recently, mutually
exclusive mutations in BRAF and SMO were identified causing constitutive
activation of MAPK and hedgehog signaling pathways. To explore further such
clinically relevant genotype-phenotype correlations, we here comprehensively
analyzed a large series of ameloblastomas (98 paraffin block of 76 patients) with
respect to genomic alterations, clinical presentation, and histological features 
collected from the archives of three different pathology centers in France,
Germany, and Turkey. In good agreement with previously published data, we
observed BRAF mutations almost exclusively in mandibular tumors, SMO mutations
predominantly in maxillary tumors, and single mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and NRAS. 
KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, CDKN2A, FGFR, and CTNNB1 mutations co-occurred in the
background of either BRAF or SMO mutations. Strikingly, multiple mutations were
exclusively observed in European patients, in solid ameloblastomas and were
associated with a very high risk for recurrence. In contrast, tumors with a
single BRAF mutation revealed a lower risk for relapse. We here establish a
comprehensive landscape of mutations in the MAPK and hedgehog signaling pathways 
relating to clinical features of ameloblastoma. Our data suggest that
ameloblastomas harboring single BRAF mutations are excellent candidates for
neo-adjuvant therapies with combined BRAF/MEK inhibitors and that the risk of
recurrence maybe stratified based on the mutational spectrum.

Non-invasive low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (NILGPUC) of the bladder is
regarded as a relatively indolent disease. However, its propensity for frequent
recurrences constitutes a major clinical problem. Additionally, there is a
progression risk of 10-15% to either a higher grade and/or a higher stage disease
in these tumors. The molecular factors that will predict recurrence and
progression in low-grade pTa bladder carcinoma have not yet been elucidated.
Herein, we investigated the association of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
on chromosome 10 (PTEN) alterations with recurrence and progression in NILGPUC
using immunohistochemistry. Eighty-one cases of bladder cancer initially
diagnosed as NILGPUC in a single institution with follow-up were encountered
after searching medical records. Tissue microarrays (TMA) that contained both
tumor and non-neoplastic mucosa from each case were constructed using paraffin
blocks of transurethral resections. Sections from TMA blocks were stained
immunohistochemically for PTEN protein and were evaluable in 76 cases. Any
absence of staining was recorded and correlated with clinical findings. Ten
patients (13.2%) showed progression and 41 (53.9%) showed recurrence. Reduced
PTEN expression was observed in 29 cases (38.1%). Cases with reduced PTEN had
higher progression rate compared to cases with intact PTEN (p = 0.026). Tumor
relapse was more frequent in cases with reduced PTEN (65.5 vs 46.8%), but this
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.112). On the other hand,
decreased PTEN expression was associated with higher number of recurrence
episodes (p = 0.002). PTEN seems to have a link with the disease course in
NILGPUC of the bladder.

Compared With Elastin Stains, h-Caldesmon and Desmin Offer Superior Detection of 
Vessel Invasion in Gastric, Pancreatic, and Colorectal Adenocarcinomas.

BACKGROUND: The presence of vessel invasion is considered indicative of a poor
prognosis in many malignant tumors. We aimed to compare the sensitivity of
elastin stains (van Gieson's and orcein methods) with 2 smooth muscle markers
(h-caldesmon and desmin) in gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal adenocarcinoma
specimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 27 (29.3%) gastric, 35 (38.0%) pancreatic, and 30 
(32.6%) colorectal resection specimens. We applied a provisional classification
of vessel invasion patterns: type A, a focus with a nearby artery unaccompanied
by a vein; type T, a focus at the invasive front without an unaccompanied artery;
and type X, foci that only appeared by any of the 4 stains used.
RESULTS: There were 369 foci. The smooth muscle markers were more sensitive than 
the elastin stains, and h-caldesmon more sensitive than desmin, in all types.
Among the 139 type A foci, 33 (23.7%) were positive by desmin and h-caldesmon,
whereas the elastin stains were not ( P = .001). h-Caldesmon was the only
positive marker in 11 (7.9%; P = .011). Among the 78 type T foci, 21 (26.9%) were
positive by desmin and h-caldesmon, when both elastin stains were negative ( P = 
.000). In 16 (20.5%) foci, h-caldesmon was the only positive marker ( P = .002). 
Among 152 type X foci, 91 (59.9%) were positive by all markers, 26 (17.1%) by
both desmin and h-caldesmon, and 9 (5.9%) by only the 2 elastin stains ( P =
.001).
CONCLUSION: We recommend these stains for suspect foci in gastric, pancreatic,
and colorectal adenocarcinoma specimens. They might highlight both predictable
and unpredictable foci.

Turkey.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the usability of MUC1 and p53
for differential diagnosis of noninvasive papillary urothelial neoplasias,
especially for distinguishing papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant
potential (PUNLMP) from low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (LGPUC) when the
histologic signs are not obvious.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen biopsy specimens of the patients with PUNLMP, 20
with LGPUC and 13 with high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (HGPUC) were
stained for MUC1 and p53 protein by immunohistochemical methods. Histological
grading was performed according to an algorithm, which allows histological
parameters used in 2004 WHO/ISUP 1998.
RESULTS: We had obvious statistical difference for aberrant expression pattern of
MUC1 between PUNLMP and LGPUC-HGPUC (P = 0.007). Positivity of MUC1 expression in
cytoplasm of basal cells was more observed in HGPUC and LGPUC, whereas PUNLMP was
more often showing apical and superficial positivity of MUC1 expression (P =
0.001 and 0.011). Nuclear p53 protein in HGPUC was obviously more frequent than
that in LGPUC and PUNLMP (P < 0.001). Measures showed statistical difference
among aberrant MUC1 expression, p53 overexpression, and tumor grade (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: MUC1 and p53 may be helpful immunohistochemical markers for
distinguishing PUNLMP from LGPUC and HGPUC, when the histologic signs are not
obvious.

Solid cell nests (SCNs) are usually distinguished on conventional H&E-stained
sections; however, the morphological heterogeneity in SCNs and hyperplasia of
these ultimobranchial body remnants can mimic other diagnostic entities including
but not limited to papillary microcarcinoma. In order to confirm the thyroid
follicular epithelial origin and exclude the possibility of SCNs, most
diagnosticians use immunohistochemical biomarkers of thyroid follicular
epithelial cells and/or those of SCNs. While the expression profile of monoclonal
PAX8 has not been reported previously in SCNs, the status of TTF-1 expression
using the 8G7G3/1 clone has been inconsistent among several studies. Given the
potential diagnostic pitfalls, this series investigated the expression profile of
GATA3, monoclonal PAX8, and TTF-1 (SPT24), along with p63, p40, monoclonal
calcitonin, monoclonal CEA, and HBME-1 in a tissue microarray (TMA) of 56 SCNs.
SCNs were all diffusely and strongly positive for TTF-1 (SPT24), p63, and p40,
and were negative for monoclonal PAX8 and calcitonin. Positivity for GATA3 and
monoclonal CEA was identified in 41 (73.2%) and 36 (64.3%) of SCNs. In addition, 
18 (32.1%) SCNs displayed HBME-1 reactivity. These findings expand the
immunohistochemical correlates of SCNs by demonstrating positivity for GATA3 and 
TTF-1 (SPT24), and negativity for monoclonal PAX8. The identification of
monoclonal CEA expression and HBME-1 in SCNs also underscores the limitations of 
these select biomarkers in the distinction of C cell proliferations and papillary
microcarcinoma, respectively. The findings of this series also suggest that
positivity for TTF-1 (SPT24) alone should not be used to confirm the thyroid
follicular epithelial origin. Therefore, the combined use of TTF-1 (SPT24) and
monoclonal PAX8 in association with p63 or p40 provides an accurate distinction
of SCNs.

Social networking has become a part of daily life for most people. In the era of 
globalization, it has become indispensable for effective communication between
friends and peers across the world. Today, social media use is not restricted
only to our personal lives; it is becoming increasingly incorporated into our
professional lives, as well. Social media platforms are rapidly becoming a
necessary tool for medical professionals. Apt use of social media platforms can
revolutionize scientific communication and collaboration. Pathologists are
increasingly counted among Facebook's 2 billion users and Twitter's 328 million
members. Social media can be a powerful tool not only for individual career
progression but also for raising the public profile of the specialty of
pathology. It is now possible for us to reach out to millions of people,
simultaneously and instantaneously, just by touching a screen. Real-time
interactions between physicians, across geographic borders and subspecialty
borders, will undeniably open unexplored avenues for effective communication,
consultation, research collaboration, and education. Knowledge sharing through
social media will immensely enrich and grow our careers as pathologists; it will 
also enlighten the public and physicians of other specialties as to the crucial
role of pathologists in patient care. We discuss the uses of Facebook and Twitter
in modern day pathology, its implication in routine daily practice, pros and
cons, and tips for effective social media use by pathologists.

This paper gives an update on the local distributions of HCV genotypes in Aydin
province of Turkey, provides a comparison with the previous records, and
discusses the potential causal reasons shaping the evolving genotype profiles.
Patient files from 2011 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed, and newly detected
cases were documented. Out of 286 patients, male and female ratios were
determined to remain nearly the same (~50%). Genotype 1 was still the most common
(90.2%), followed by genotype 3 (5.9%), genotype 2 (2.1%), and genotype 4 (1.4%) 
in frequency. There were international patients (4.50%). One patient had
genotyped 2+3 together. Genotypes 4 and 2+3 were detected for the first time, and
the patients with genotype 4 were interestingly all male and also domestic
individuals. However, these patients traveled or lived abroad in the past due to 
occupational reasons, thereby likely acquired the infection while abroad. HCV
surveillance system is currently inadequate and some infected patients may go
undetected in the province. Remapping the regional distribution of HCV genotypes 
from time-to-time is required for identifying the local dynamics and causes
leading to it. This process enhances the clinical preparation and readiness for
the better management of the disease.

The relationship between PAX2 and another anti-apoptotic gene, BCL-2, has been
shown in a limited number of studies. The aims of this study are to investigate
the value of PAX2 and BCL-2 expressions in lesions which have been defined as
nonatypical hyperplasia in terms of detecting EIN and to evaluate the relations
of these proteins in EIN. For this purpose, 108 cases of non-atypical endometrial
hyperplasia diagnosed from 2006 to 2011 were re-evaluated. Immunohistochemical
studies with PAX2 and BCL-2 were performed in 20 cases with EIN and 34 cases with
benign hyperplasia. The mean BCL-2 immunohistochemistry scores of benign
hyperplasia and EIN cases were 4.06 ± 1.04 and 4.63 ± 2.03, respectively. The
mean BCL-2 score of EIN cases was significantly higher than benign hyperplasia
(p = 0.021). The mean PAX2 scores of benign hyperplasia and EIN cases were
4.32 ± 1.07 and 2.19 ± 2.34, respectively. The mean PAX2 scores of EIN cases were
significantly lower than benign hyperplasia (p = 0.001). BCL-2 expression was
increased compared to normal endometrium in 66.7% of EIN cases, and PAX2
expression was decreased in 73.3%. Consistent with this, in 60% of cases, BCL-2
expression was increased compared to normal endometrium, while PAX2 expression
was decreased. BCL-2 and PAX2 protein expression changes occur in early phases of
endometrial tumorigenesis. These changes are often seen as a simultaneous
increase in BCL-2 expression and decrease in PAX2 expression.

INTRODUCTION: Ovotesticular disorder of sex development (OT-DSD) is a rare
disorder of sexual differentiation characterized by the presence of both
testicular and ovarian tissue in an individual and the majority of cases have
been reported with 46,XX karyotype. In 46,XX cases, testicular differentiation
may occur due to the translocation of SRY to the X chromosome or to an autosome.
CASE REPORT: Herein, we present a female newborn with a combination of trisomy 13
and SRY (-) XX OT-DSD.
CONCLUSION: Trisomy 13 is a relatively common and well-known chromosomal disorder
in which disorders of sexual differentiation are not frequent. In the absence of 
SRY, overexpression of pro-testis genes, or decreased expression of
pro-ovarian/anti-testis genes have been suggested as underlying mechanisms of
testicular formation. The findings in this patient were suggestive of an
underlying genomic disorder associated with FGF9 and/or SPRY2.

High-fat diet (HFD) and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats provide useful
animal model for type II diabetes mellitus. Oxidative stress and advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) play a role in the development of diabetic
complications. Carnosine (CAR) has anti-oxidant and anti-glycating properties. We
investigated the effects of CAR on oxidation and glycation products in HFD+STZ
rats. Rats were fed with HFD (60% of total calories from fat) for 4 weeks, and
then a single dose of STZ (40 mg/kg; i.p.) was applied. Rats with blood glucose
levels above 200 mg/dl were fed with HFD until the end of the 12th week. CAR
(250 mg/kg body weight; i.p.; five times a week) was administered to the rats for
the last four weeks. CAR significantly decreased serum triglyceride (TG) (57.7%),
cholesterol (35.6%) levels and hepatic marker enzyme activities of HFD+STZ rats. 
It significantly reduced serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) (23.7%), AGEs
(13.4%) and advanced oxidized protein products (AOPP) (35.9%) and hepatic TG
(59%), ROS (26%), malondialdehyde (MDA) (11.5%), protein carbonyl (PC) (19.2%)
and AGE (20.2%) levels. Liver steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning were also
significantly reduced. However, CAR treatment did not alter serum glucose and
blood glycated haemoglobin and hepatic anti-oxidant enzyme activities/mRNA
expressions in HFD+STZ rats. Our results indicate that CAR decreased accumulation
of oxidation and glycation products, such as MDA, AGE, AOPP and PC in the serum
and liver and ameliorated hepatic dysfunction in HFD+STZ rats. This effect may be
related to its anti-oxidative, anti-glycating, and anti-lipogenic potential.

AIMS: Spindle cell proliferation within clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
is usually considered as a sarcomatoid differentiation. Low-grade spindle cell
proliferation (LG-SCP) in ccRCC was first described in 2001. This phenomenon is
not common and can pose diagnostic challenges, particularly in core biopsies. The
aim of this study was to describe morphological, immunohistochemical and
molecular characteristics of ccRCCs with LG-SCP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven cases of ccRCC with LG-SCP were retrieved from
approximately 21 000 renal tumours in our registry. Ten cases of conventional
ccRCC and 10 cases of typical sarcomatoid ccRCC were included as control groups. 
Morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) were analysed. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene abnormalities
were also analysed using molecular genetics. Among ccRCC with LG-SCP cases, there
were five males and five females (clinical information was not available in one
case) with a median age of 67 years (mean: 68.5, range: 60-81 years). Average
tumour size was 7.1 cm (median:7.5, range:1.7-12 cm). Follow-up data were
available in nine cases (mean: 44.78 months), with no aggressive behaviour seen. 
On average, LG-SCP areas constituted 5-80% of tumour volume (mean: 32.3%).
Necrotic/regressed areas were seen in all cases ranging from 5% to 30%. LG-SCP
was clearly epithelial, with no mitoses or any evidence of mesenchymal
differentiation. Immunohistochemical profile of LG-SCP was consistent with
'conventional' ccRCC. Compared with sarcomatoid ccRCC, some EMT markers showed
alteration in LG-SCP, including lower expression of N-cadherin and Zeb1 as well
as higher expression of E-cadherin. However, there were no significant
differences in EMT markers between LG-SCP and conventional ccRCC. Abnormalities
in VHL (mutations, LOH3p) were found in six of 11 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that LG-SCP in ccRCC have comparable
immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics to those seen in 'conventional'
ccRCC. Further, immunohistochemical analysis of EMT markers showed that LG-SCP
did not differ from 'conventional' ccRCC. We believe that LG-SCP is a part of
morphological heterogeneity in ccRCCs and that they may not represent an initial 
stage of sarcomatoid differentiation. This is supported further by the fact that 
ccRCC with LG-SCP did not display more aggressive behaviour than 'conventional'
ccRCC.

This study investigated whether a high-fructose (HFr) diet changes the morphology
of seminiferous tubules (ST) in rats and resveratrol (RES) has a possible
restoring effect in this sense. Fructose (30%; w/v) was administered to rats
alone or together with RES (50 mg/L) in drinking water for 8 weeks. In the HFr
group, destruction of the germinal epithelium led to the detection of immature
germ cells in the lumen. HFr diet gave rise to a decrease in the ST diameters
(p < 0.05), Johnsen's tubular biopsy score values (p < 0.001), and an increase in
the apoptotic index (p < 0.05). Ultrastructurally, HFr feeding increased lipid
accumulation (p < 0.01), mitochondrial damage, and acrosomal abnormalities in
spermatogenic cells. Treatment of HFr -fed rats with RES improved the reduced ST 
diameters and overall general histological and ultrastructural abnormalities of
the STs, but did not change the increased apoptotic index.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatotoxicity is a major complication of acetaminophen (APAP), a
widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug. Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally
occurring diphenol and it has anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory
properties.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, the beneficial effects of RSV on APAP-induced
hepatotoxicity was investigated in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Group 1: Ethanol, Group 2: Saline, Group 3: RSV
(10 mg/kg/ip), Group 4: APAP (1000 mg/kg/ip/single dose), Group 5: APAP+RSV
(20 min after administration of APAP). The rats were sacrificed 24 h after
administration of APAP. Light and electron microscopic changes were evaluated.
Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and
superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in liver tissue.
RESULTS: Rats of the ethanol, saline, and RSV groups did not present any
histopathological alterations. In the APAP group, we observed vascular
congestion, necrosis, inflammation, sinusoidal dilatation, and loss of glycogen
content. In the APAP+RSV group, these changes were markedly reduced. iNOS
immunostaining showed very weak positive stained hepatocytes the sections of
control, saline, and RSV groups. However, in the APAP group, iNOS immunostaining 
was most evident in pericentral hepatocytes. In the same areas in APAP+RSV group,
intensity of iNOS immunostaining decreased. A significant increase in MDA and
decreases in GSH level, CAT, and SOD activity indicated that APAP-induced
hepatotoxicity was mediated through oxidative stress. Significant beneficial
changes were noted in tissue oxidative stress indicators in rats treated with
RSV.
CONCLUSION: These biochemical, histopathological, and ultrastructural findings
revealed that RSV reduced the severity of APAP-induced alterations in liver.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment 
on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats
using light and electron microscopic techniques.
METHODS: Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and
DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day 
dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D
group, 6 mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed
simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the
28 days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for
histological examinations.
RESULTS: FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a
significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group.
Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA
group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles 
were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated
granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in
interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that
atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the 
androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian
morphology and functions. Vitamin D has positive effects on the hormonal and
structural changes observed in PCOS, but it has been concluded that long-term use
may be more beneficial.

Intramucosal lipomas are rare and easily overlooked by pathologists, despite
their diagnostic significance for Cowden syndrome (PTEN hamartoma tumor
syndrome), an inherited multiorgan cancer syndrome. Only 25-35% of patients
harbor identifiable PTEN mutations, thus clinical features, like intramucosal
lipomas, remain the mainstay of diagnosis. The significance and diagnostic
approach to intramucosal lipomas have not been thoroughly addressed in the
literature. Intramucosal lipomas are mimicked by pseudolipomatosis coli, an
artifactual mucosal gas infiltration from endoscopic insufflation. This
differential was investigated by morphology and S-100 immunohistochemistry.
Twenty-five colonic intramucosal lipomas were identified from 176 archival
gastrointestinal lipomas from 1998 to 2017. Controls included 40 submucosal
lipomas and 30 pseudolipomatoses. S-100 immunohistochemistry on all 95 lesions
confirmed delicate fat vacuole membranous and nuclear S-100 staining in lipomas
absent from pseudolipomatoses. Differentiating morphology between intramucosal
lipoma and pseudolipomatosis, respectively, included consistently large, regular 
fat vacuoles (92% vs 7%), associated spindle cells (80% vs 0%), and mucosal
lymphoid aggregate involvement (12% vs 80%). Of the 25 intramucosal lipomas, five
patients (20%) had confirmed Cowden syndrome (four with PTEN mutations). In four 
of these Cowden patients, the intramucosal lipoma was the index diagnostic
lesion. Three (12%) intramucosal lipoma patients had additional clinical features
associated with Cowden syndrome, but did not meet the diagnostic criteria.
Sporadic-type intramucosal lipomas were identified in 17 patients (68%) without
evidence of Cowden syndrome, including three with normal PTEN genetic testing. No
distinguishing endoscopic or pathologic polyp features were identified between
sporadic and syndromic intramucosal lipomas. These data provide evidence that
intramucosal lipomas are important harbingers of Cowden syndrome, making up
approximately one-third of this series, the largest in the literature. We also
show for the first time that two-thirds of intramucosal lipomas are sporadic.
Gastrointestinal pathologists, gastroenterologists, and geneticists should
increase their awareness of this subtle but diagnosable lesion strongly
associated with Cowden syndrome.

Inexpensive, rapid, and reliable tests for detecting the presence and drug
susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are urgently needed
to control the transmission of tuberculosis. In this study, we aimed to assess
the accuracy and speed of the microscopic-observation drug susceptibility (MODS) 
assay in the identification of MTBC and detection of multidrug resistance. Sputum
samples from patients suspected to have tuberculosis were simultaneously tested
with MODS and conventional culture [Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture, BACTEC MGIT™ 
960 (MGIT) system], and drug susceptibility testing (MGIT system) methods. A
total of 331 sputum samples were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity of MODS
assay for detection of MTBC strains were 96% and 98.8%, respectively. MODS assay 
detected multidrug resistant MTBC isolates with 92.3% sensitivity and 96.6%
specificity. Median time to culture positivity was similar for MGIT (8 days) and 
MODS culture (8 days), but was significantly longer with LJ culture (20 days)
(p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Median time to availability of the
susceptibility results was significantly (p < 0.0001) shorter with MODS assay
(8 days) than MGIT system (20 days). In conclusion, MODS is an inexpensive and
rapid test with good performance characteristics for direct diagnosis of
tuberculosis and detection of multidrug resistance.

This study aimed to evaluate the morphometric measurements in cases with
papillary thyroid carcinoma, and determine a cut-off value to support diagnosis. 
Fifty cases with a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were included
in the study with their Galectine-3, CK-19 and HBME-1 immunohistochemical
staining results. Demographic and clinical data gathered from pathology reports, 
which included demographic information such as patients' sex, age, macroscopic
tumor size, number of tumor focuses; prognostic parameters such as lenfovascular 
invasion, perineural invasion, thyroid capsule invasion; and results of
immunohistochemical CK- 19, Galectin-3 and HBME-1 staining. Longest nuclear
diameters of 150 tumor cells and 150 normal thyrocytes of each case were manually
measured in an image analysis software, and mean longest nuclear diameters
(MLND-TC and MLND-NC), and also tumor cell/normal cell longest nuclear diameter
ratio (TC/NC-LNDR) were calculated. MLND-TC was higher than MLND-NC. The cases
with higher MLND-TC had increased risk of capsule invasion in case of a negative 
staining with Galectine-3, HBME-1, or CK-19. When TC/NC-LNDR was high, number of 
tumor focus tended to be multiple and lymphovascular invasion risk was also
increased. Subtypes of PTC were not differed regarding staining patterns. And
finally, increased TC/NC-LNDR was associated with increased risk of having poor
prognostic factors. The results of this study suggest that MLND-NC, MLND-TC, and 
TC/NCLNDR are valuable and easy-to-use measures, which can assist routine
histology practice.

HER2 amplification has been demonstrated in 15-25% of invasive breast carcinomas 
and can be assessed using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods. 
Here, we compared the accuracy of dual SISH to manual FISH in HER2 (2+) breast
carcinoma and evaluated the feasibility of dual SISH method in routine practice. 
Sixty HER2 (2+) consecutive tumor samples diagnosed between January 2009 and
February 2013 were selected. Demographic, histological and immunohistochemical
features and FISH results were recruited from patient records and compared to
dual SISH results. Nine (15%) of the 60 tumor samples were excluded from
statistical analysis due to lack of interpretable SISH signals. HER2 staining
percentages by immunohistochemistry differed between 20 and 80%. HER2
amplification was shown in 7 (13.7%) and 8 (15.7%) patients by FISH and SISH,
respectively. Very good agreement was observed between FISH and SISH methods
(kappa value: 0.92). Significant correlation was found between HER2 staining
percentage and FISH positivity, in contrast to SISH positivity (p=0.012 vs.
p=0.069). Our results are consistent with previously reported literature,
indicating SISH can be used to determine HER2 status. However, preanalytical and 
analytical problems may cause inadequate or uncountable signals, making
interpretation impossible for the pathologist and highlighting the importance of 
standardization and quality control programs.

Cellular phones are major sources of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) that can
penetrate the human body and pose serious health hazards. The increasingly
widespread use of mobile communication systems has raised concerns about the
effects of cellphone radiofrequency (RF) on the hippocampus because of its close 
proximity to radiation during cellphone use. The effects of cellphone EMR
exposure on the hippocampus of rats and the possible counteractive effects of
Ginkgo biloba (Egb761) were aimed to investigate. Rats were divided into three
groups: Control, EMR, and EMR+Egb761. The EMR and EMR+Egb761 groups were exposed 
to cellphone EMR for one month. Egb761 was also administered to the EMR+Egb761
group. Specifically, we evaluated the effect of RF exposure on rat hippocampi at 
harmful EMR levels (0.96 W/kg specific absorption rate [SAR]) for one month and
also investigated the possible impact of Ginkgo biloba (Egb761) using
stereological, TUNEL-staining, and immunohistochemical methods. An increase in
apoptotic proteins (Bax, Acas-3) and a decrease in anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2)
immunoreactivity along with a decrease in the total granule and pyramidal cell
count were noted in the EMR group. A decrease in Bax and Acas-3 and an increase
in Bcl-2 immunoreactivity were observed in rats treated with Egb761 in addition
to a decrease in TUNEL-stained apoptotic cells and a higher total viable cell
number. In conclusion, chronic cellphone EMR exposure may affect hippocampal cell
viability, and Egb761 may be used to mitigate some of the deleterious effects.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to discuss smartphone usage in telecytology and
determine intraobserver concordance between microscopic cytopathological
diagnoses and diagnoses derived via static smartphone images.
METHODS: The study was conducted with 172 cytologic material. A pathologist
captured static images of the cytology slides from the ocular lens of a
microscope using a smartphone. The images were transferred via WhatsApp® to a
cytopathologist working in another center who made all the microscopic
cytopathological diagnoses 5-27 months ago. The cytopathologist diagnosed images 
on a smartphone without knowledge of their previous microscopic diagnoses. The
Kappa agreement between microscopic cytopathological diagnoses and smartphone
image diagnoses was determined.
RESULTS: The average image capturing, transfer, and remote cytopathological
diagnostic time for one case was 6.20 minutes. The percentage of cases whose
microscopic and smartphone image diagnoses were concordant was 84.30%, and the
percentage of those whose diagnoses were discordant was 15.69%. The highest Kappa
agreement was observed in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration
(1.000), and the lowest agreement was observed in urine cytology (0.665). Patient
management changed with smart phone image diagnoses at 11.04%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that easy, fast, and high-quality image capturing 
and transfer is possible from cytology slides using smartphones. The
intraobserver Kappa agreement between the microscopic cytopathological diagnoses 
and remote smartphone image diagnoses was high. It was found that remote
diagnosis due to difficulties in telecytology might change patient management.
The developments in the smartphone camera technology and transfer software make
them efficient telepathology and telecytology tools.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the performance of computer-assisted liquid-based
cytology, primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening, and
cytology-hrHPV cotesting with regards to the detection rate of cervical cancer
precursor lesions.
METHODS: A total of 22,653 computer-assisted liquid-based cytology specimens
interpreted between 2013 and 2015 were included in the study. We compared the
false-negative rates and sensitivities for computer-assisted liquid-based
cytology, primary hrHPV screening and cytology-hrHPV cotesting among women with
normal and abnormal cytologies. Among 1,748 women who had undergone cotesting,
249 underwent follow-up biopsies.
RESULTS: For detecting biopsy-confirmed high-grade lesions, the sensitivities of 
using hrHPV, Pap tests, and cytology-hrHPV cotesting were 90.67%, 88%, and
98.67%, respectively, while the false-negative rates for hrHPV and Pap tests were
9.3% and 12%, respectively. The false negative rate for cotesting was only 1.3%.
CONCLUSION: Based on the significantly high sensitivity and lower false-negative 
rates achieved, we conclude that the combination of cytologic screening with
hrHPV testing is the best preferred strategy for detection of cervical precursor 
lesions in our country's conditions.

BACKGROUND: Genetic factors play a large role in cancer, and thus, there is a
great desire to understand the effects of different genes in cancer and to also
develop gene therapy for better treatments. Therefore, the development of
alternative diagnosis and therapy modalities is of utmost importance. The aim of 
our study was to illuminate the role of ESM1 (endothelial cell-specific
molecule-1, also known as Endocan) in proliferation and migration of head and
neck cancer, thus helping to pave the way for new treatment modalities and
predictive biomarkers.
METHODS: ESM1 expression was shown with immunofluorescence assay using confocal
laser scanning microscope in primary and metastatic head and neck cancer cells.
ESM1 expression was knocked down by RNA interference in head and neck cancer
cells. Knockdown efficiency was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and
Western blot. Cell proliferation and migration assays were performed by
xCELLigence real-time cell analysis system.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence assay showed nuclear localization and high expression
of ESM1 in primary and metastatic head and neck cancer cells. ESM1 mRNA and
protein levels were significantly decreased in ESM1-knockdown cells compared to
control. ESM1-knockdown cells showed reduced proliferation and migration activity
when compared to control cells.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ESM1 has roles on proliferation and
migration of head and neck cancer cells.

Primary cardiac lymphoma is a rare type of extranodal lymphoma that involves only
heart and/or pericardium. It is usually observed in immunodeficient people.
However, immunocompetent patients may also suffer from this disease. Most primary
cardiac lymphomas are of B-cell lineage, and they usually present as diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with concurrently
high MYC and BCL2 expression, which is named as double-expressor lymphoma (DEL), 
is a rare subtype of DLBCL. Here we report a rare case of a primary cardiac DEL
in an immunocompetent 65-year old Chinese woman. Echocardiography and magnetic
resonance imaging revealed a mass of 6.6 cm×5.6 cm in the right atrium. No tumor 
formations were observed in other organs. Histopathologic examination showed that
the cardiac tumor was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, non-germinal center B-cell
type by Hans algorithm. The tumor cells showed high MYC and BCL2 protein
expression by immunohistochemistry, with high proliferative index.

Genetic variations in DNA repair genes may affect DNA repair capacity therefore
increase risk for cancer. In our study, we evaluted the relation between DNA
repair gene polymorphisms XRCC1 rs1799782, rs25487, rs25489; XPC rs2228000,
rs2228001; XPD rs1799793, rs13181; XRCC3 rs861539; RAD51B rs10483813, rs1314913
and breast cancer risk for 202 Turkish cases in total, in which 102 patients with
breast cancer and 100 controls. Genotyping of the DNA samples was carried out by 
multiplex PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
with time of flight measurement (MALDI-TOF) using Sequenom MassARRAY 4 analyzer. 
Genotype and allele distributions were calculated between the groups. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. rs25487 AA genotype and A
allele was found to be increased in the control group (respectively, OR 0.16 95% 
CI 0.02-1.06, p = 0.058; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.36, p = 0.043) and rs861539 T
allele was found to be decreased in the patient group (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.01-2.30,
p = 0.049). No association with breast cancer was found for the remaining SNPs.
Our findings suggest that XRCC1 rs25487 AA genotype and A allele, XRCC3 rs861539 
T allele may have protective effects in breast cancer for Turkish population.

INTRODUCTION: To assess the pendrin expression density in placental bed biopsies 
from preeclampsia cases in comparison with healthy term controls.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective case-control study with 106 placental bed
biopsies obtained during cesarean deliveries. Pendrin expression was evaluated by
immunohistochemical staining in different hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
RESULTS: Pendrin immunostaining frequency was higher in the hypertensive
disorders group (p: 0.024), which was a result of the high frequency in the
early-onset preeclampsia group. Uterine artery pulsatility indices were higher in
pendrin positive patients than in the negatives in the case group. Gravidity was 
not found to affect the pendrin expression frequency in the placental bed.
CONCLUSION: Placental ischemia seems to be an important determinant of pendrin
expression in pregnant decidua. Increased pendrin density in early-onset
preeclampsia could be a pathogenetic mechanism in or a part of the adaptational
response to the development of the hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically investigate the 
presence and localization of ADAMTS 1, 4, 5, 8 and 9 in decidual and chorionic
tissues in first trimester pregnancy losses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted with early pregnancy failure
decidual and chorionic tissue samples from 36 pregnant women in the first
trimester of pregnancy (ongoing pregnancies, missed miscarriages, anembryonic
pregnancies) Results: It was observed that the decidual and chorionic tissue
levels of ADAMTS 1, 4, 5, and 8 in ongoing pregnancies were more intensely
expressed when compared with miscarriages. ADAMTS 1 expression was not observed
in the anembryonic pregnancies, ADAMTS 4, 5, and 8 were less intensely expressed.
ADAMTS 9 showed no staining in any group.
CONCLUSION: ADAMTS 1 may be necessary during the decidualization and implantation
stages of early normal pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer
worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a leading etiological factor
in cervical carcinoma.The aim of this study was to compare HPV positivity, EGFR
and TOP2A gene copy number variations and cervical cytologic findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 100 female volunteers between
21-64 years old. Cytologic analysis was performed using the liquid-based cytology
technique. HPV DNA testing was performed in all cases. Copy number variations
that belong to EGFR and TOP2A genes evaluated by using FISH analysis.
RESULTS: Cytologic analysis of the cervical samples revealed abnormal findings in
13 of the 100 study subjects. ASCUS , LSIL, HSIL were determined in 8, 2 and 3
cases respectively as the result of cytologic analysis on all cases. Forty-one
(41%) of the 100 women were HPV-positive. Chi-square analysis confirmed that
HPV-positive women showed significantly more abnormal cytology (P = 0.035). EGFR 
deletion, TOP2A deletion and both EGFR and TOP2A deletion were determined in 1, 8
and 1 cases respectively. We found no statistical difference in abnormal
cytologic findings between subjects with these gene deletions and subjects with
normal gene copy numbers (P > 0.05 for both). No cases of amplification were
determined for either gene.
CONCLUSION: As a result, HPV positivity and the determination of changes that may
occur in the gene copy number in patients with abnormal cytology can be an
important tool on account of prognosis. Research with more patients may be
suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome, uterine anomalies, and chromosomal
aberrations are identifiable causes of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Herein,
our aim is to investigate the relationship between celiac disease (CD) specific
antitransglutaminase antibodies (ATA) and unexplained RPL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross sectional case-control study conducted on
86 women (45 RPL and 41 controls) in a tertiary level maternity hospital. Elisa
kit was used to determine ATA IgA and IgG levels.
RESULTS: One (2.2%) patient with ATA IgG positivity was present in the RPL group.
There were three (7.3%) cases with positive for ATA IgA in the control group, and
one (2.2%) case in the study group. No statistically significant differences were
observed between the groups in terms of ATA IgG and IgA.
CONCLUSION: There is no association between CD markers and unexplained RPL. For
the present, we do not recommend screening for ATA IgA and ATA IgG in patients
with a history of RPL.

PURPOSE: Aldo-keto reductases (including AKR1B1 and AKR1B10) constitute a family 
of oxidoreductases that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes
and cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Available data indicate that,
despite their similarities in structure and enzymatic functions, their roles in
CRC may be divergent. Here, we aimed to determine the expression and functional
implications of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in CRC.
METHODS: AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 gene expression levels were analyzed using publicly
available microarray data and ex vivo CRC-derived cDNA samples. Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data and The
Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) proteome data were analyzed to determine the effect 
of high and low AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 expression levels in CRC patients.
Proliferation, cell cycle progression, cellular motility, adhesion and
inflammation were determined in CRC-derived cell lines in which these genes were 
either exogenously overexpressed or silenced.
RESULTS: We found that the expression of AKR1B1 was unaltered, whereas that of
AKR1B10 was decreased in primary CRCs. GSEA revealed that, while high AKR1B1
expression was associated with increased cell cycle progression, cellular
motility and inflammation, high AKR1B10 expression was associated with a weak
inflammatory phenotype. Functional studies carried out in CRC-derived cell lines 
confirmed these data. Microarray data analysis indicated that high expression
levels of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 were significantly associated with shorter and
longer disease-free survival rates, respectively. A combined gene expression
signature of AKR1B10 (low) and AKR1B1 (high) showed a better prognostic
stratification of CRC patients independent of confounding factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite their similarities, the expression levels and functions of
AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 are highly divergent in CRC, and they may have prognostic
implications.

In cases of fall from a height, the presence of laryngohyoid fracture or bleeding
at autopsy constitutes a suspicion of strangulation before trauma in these types 
of cases. This study has aimed to investigate the incidence of laryngohyoid
fractures in nonhomicidal fall from height cases, and their relationship with
age, sex, height of fall, body mass index, and other injuries.A total of 170
cases proven to be nonhomicidal falls from height with certain witnesses and
evidences in 4683 autopsy cases in 2013 were included in this study.The mean age 
of the patients included in the study was 39.96 ± 22.25, and 70.6% of the cases
were men. It was found that 118 (69.4%) of the deaths were accidental and 52
(30.6%) were suicidal. Laryngohyoid fracture was determined in 9.4% of the cases.
In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, it was found that as the height
increased, the incidence of hyoid bone fracture increased, and as the age
increased, the incidence of thyroid cartilage fracture increased significantly.
Furthermore, in cases with cervical spine fractures, the incidence of hyoid bone 
fracture, and in cases with clavicle or cervical spine fractures, the incidence
of thyroid cartilage fracture were observed to be significantly higher.When there
is a suspicion in falls from height with laryngohyoid fractures, the height of
fall, the age of case, and the injury in the adjacent bones contribute to the
determination of the cause and manner of death.

The diagnosis of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) confined to the
adrenal gland can be challenging. Although there are diagnostic and prognostic
molecular tests for ACC, they remain largely unutilized. We examined the
diagnostic and prognostic value of altered reticulin framework and the
immunoprofile of biomarkers including IGF-2, proteins involved in cell
proliferation and mitotic spindle regulation (Ki67, p53, BUB1B, HURP, NEK2), DNA 
damage repair (PBK, γ-H2AX), telomere regulation (DAX, ATRX), wnt-signaling
pathway (beta-catenin) and PI3K signaling pathway (PTEN, phospho-mTOR) in a
tissue microarray of 50 adenomas and 43 carcinomas that were characterized for
angioinvasion as defined by strict criteria, Weiss score, and mitotic rate-based 
tumor grade. IGF-2 and proteins involved in cell proliferation and mitotic
spindle regulation (Ki67, p53, BUB1B, HURP, NEK2), DNA damage proteins (PBK,
γ-H2AX), regulators of telomeres (DAXX, ATRX), and beta-catenin revealed
characteristic expression profiles enabling the distinction of carcinomas from
adenomas. Not all biomarkers were informative in all carcinomas. IGF-2 was the
most useful biomarker of malignancy irrespective of tumor grade and
cytomorphologic features, as juxtanuclear Golgi-pattern IGF-2 reactivity
optimized for high specificity was identified in up to 80% of carcinomas and in
no adenomas. Loss rather than qualitative alterations of the reticulin framework 
yielded statistical difference between carcinoma and adenoma. Angioinvasion
defined as tumor cells invading through a vessel wall and intravascular tumor
cells admixed with thrombus proved to be the best prognostic parameter,
predicting adverse outcome in the entire cohort as well as within low-grade ACCs.
Low mitotic tumor grade, Weiss score, global loss of DAXX expression, and high
phospho-mTOR expression correlated with disease-free survival, but Weiss score
and biomarkers failed to predict adverse outcome in low-grade disease. Our
results underscore the importance of careful morphologic assessment coupled with 
ancillary diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of ACC.

Infantile fibrosarcomas (IFS) represent a distinct group of soft tissue tumors
occurring in patients under 2 years of age and most commonly involving the
extremities. Most IFS show recurrent ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusions, sensitivity to
chemotherapy, and an overall favorable clinical outcome. However, outside these
well-defined pathologic features, no studies have investigated IFS lacking
ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, or tumors with the morphology resembling IFS in older
children. This study was triggered by the identification of a novel SEPT7-BRAF
fusion in an unclassified retroperitoneal spindle cell sarcoma in a 16-year-old
female by targeted RNA sequencing. Fluorescence in situ hybridization screening
of 9 additional tumors with similar phenotype and lacking ETV6-NTRK3 identified 4
additional cases with BRAF gene rearrangements in the pelvic cavity (n=2),
paraspinal region (n=1), and thigh (n=1) of young children (0 to 3 y old).
Histologically, 4 cases including the index case shared a fascicular growth of
packed monomorphic spindle cells, with uniform nuclei and fine chromatin, and a
dilated branching vasculature; while the remaining case was composed of compact
cellular sheets of short spindle to ovoid cells. In addition, a minor small blue 
round cell component was present in 1 case. Mitotic activity ranged from 1 to
9/10 high power fields. Immunohistochemical stains were nonspecific, with only
focal smooth muscle actin staining demonstrated in 3 cases tested. Of the
remaining 5 BRAF negative cases, further RNA sequencing identified 1 case with
EML4-NTRK3 in an 1-year-old boy with a foot IFS, and a second case with
TPM3-NTRK1 fusion in a 7-week-old infant with a retroperitoneal lesion. Our
findings of recurrent BRAF gene rearrangements in tumors showing morphologic
overlap with IFS expand the genetic spectrum of fusion-positive spindle cell
sarcomas, to include unusual presentations, such as older children and
adolescents and predilection for axial location, thereby opening new
opportunities for kinase-targeted therapeutic intervention.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Tractor is regarded as a key equipment in
agriculture, and it is also used for transportation and transfer purposes in
addition to its agricultural use. Accidents resulting in death in farmlands are
frequently encountered. Tractor-related fatalities are the most common ones among
the deaths after farm accidents. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics
of tractor-related deaths and to discuss the measures that could be taken to
prevent these deaths.
METHODS: In this study, 42 cases who underwent postmortem examination and/or
autopsy because of tractor fatalities in the province of Elazig between January
2005 and December 2016 were examined retrospectively with such variables as sex, 
age, month and season of incident, cause of incident, location of incident,
position of case, and injured region.
RESULTS: Of the cases, 36 (85.7%) were male, and 6 (14.3%) were female. The
youngest case was 2 years old, and the oldest case was 83 years old; the mean age
was 43.3 ± 25.0 years. Examining the deaths regarding the cause of incident
showed that tractor rollover was the most common cause (42.9%). This was followed
by being run over by the tractor (19.0%). Of the cases, 24 (57.1%) were drivers, 
10 (23.8%) were passengers, and 8 (19.0%) were pedestrians.
CONCLUSIONS: Tractor-related fatalities due to tractor rollover are most often
seen. To reduce the deaths caused by this reason, drivers should have special
training and technical support, use helmets and seatbelts in the tractor, and
have a health check at certain intervals (especially the drivers at advanced
age).

BACKGROUND: Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) is increasing in many communities. We
investigated whether ST alters the cytological and cytomorphometric features of
buccal mucosa cells.
METHODS: Twenty male participants who had used Nicotiana rustica Linn.-containing
ST (Maras powder) for at least 10 years, and 20 healthy male controls who did not
use ST, were included in this study. After rinsing the mouth with water, samples 
were taken using a toothbrush from the buccal mucosa of subjects in both groups. 
Samples were gently spread over a glass slide. After applying a cytofixative
spray, the Papanicolaou method was used to stain the slides. The presence of
dysplasia, dyskeratosis, parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis,
karyorrhexis, and pyknosis was evaluated by light microscopy, as were the
increment amount of candida, cocco-bacillus, and Leptotrichia buccalis.
Cytomorphometric analysis was performed and at least 20 cells with well-defined
borders were evaluated from each slide, and the cellular diameter (CD), nuclear
diameter (ND), and nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio of the cells were analyzed using
a 60× objective.
RESULTS: Other than the presence of dysplasia and candida, all measured
cytological parameters were significantly higher in the ST users than in the
non-ST users. Furthermore, CD was lower while nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was
higher in the ST users than in those non-ST users.
CONCLUSION: Cytological changes associated with the use of ST, include
dyskeratosis, parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, karyorrhexis,
pyknosis together with increase in the bacterial population of cocco-bacillus and
L. buccalis. There were no significant differences in patients with dysplasia in 
spite of reduction of CD, increased nuclear size and N/C ratio.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma has a distinctive morphology and immunophenotype,
including cytokeratin 7 and CD68 co-expression. Despite the distinct findings,
accurate diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma continues to be a challenge.
Recently, fibrolamellar carcinomas were found to harbor a characteristic somatic 
gene fusion, DNAJB1-PRKACA. A break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) assay was designed to detect this fusion event and to examine its
diagnostic performance in a large, multicenter, multinational study. Cases
initially classified as fibrolamellar carcinoma based on histological features
were reviewed from 124 patients. Upon central review, 104 of the 124 cases were
classified histologically as typical of fibrolamellar carcinoma, 12 cases as
'possible fibrolamellar carcinoma' and 8 cases as 'unlikely to be fibrolamellar
carcinoma'. PRKACA FISH was positive for rearrangement in 102 of 103 (99%)
typical fibrolamellar carcinomas, 9 of 12 'possible fibrolamellar carcinomas' and
0 of 8 cases 'unlikely to be fibrolamellar carcinomas'. Within the
morphologically typical group of fibrolamellar carcinomas, two tumors with
unusual FISH patterns were also identified. Both cases had the fusion gene
DNAJB1-PRKACA, but one also had amplification of the fusion gene and one had
heterozygous deletion of the normal PRKACA locus. In addition, 88 conventional
hepatocellular carcinomas were evaluated with PRKACA FISH and all were negative. 
These findings demonstrate that FISH for the PRKACA rearrangement is a clinically
useful tool to confirm the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma, with high
sensitivity and specificity. A diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma is more
accurate when based on morphology plus confirmatory testing than when based on
morphology alone.

We present 1470 surgical resections for thymoma identified in the pathology files
of 14 institutions from 11 countries with the purpose of determining and
correlating a simplified histological classification of thymoma and pathological 
staging with clinical outcome. The study population was composed of 720 men and
750 women between the ages of 12 and 86 years (average, 54.8 years). Clinically, 
137 patients (17%) had a history of myasthenia gravis, 31 patients (3.8%) of
other autoimmune disease, and 55 (6.8%) patients of another neoplastic process.
Surgical resection was performed in all patients. Histologically, 1284 (87.13%)
cases were thymomas (World Health Organization types A, B1, and B2, and mixed
histologies), and 186 (12.7%) were atypical thymomas (World Health Organization
type B3). Of the entire group, 630 (42.9%) were encapsulated thymomas, and 840
(57.9%) were invasive thymomas in different stages. Follow-up information was
obtained in 1339 (91%) patients, who subsequently were analyzed by univariate and
multivariate statistical analysis. Follow-up ranging from 1 to 384 months was
obtained (mean, 69.2 months) showing tumor recurrence in 136 patients (10.1%),
whereas 227 died: 64 (28.2%) due to tumor and 163 (71.8%) due to other causes.
Statistical analysis shows that separation of these tumors into thymoma and
atypical thymoma is statistically significant (P = .001), whereas tumor staging
into categories of encapsulated, minimally invasive, and invasion into adjacent
organs offers a meaningful clinical assessment with a P = .038. Our findings
suggest that our simplified histological schema and pathological staging system
are excellent predictors of clinical outcome.

Breast cancer causes death mostly due to distant metastasis. During metastasis,
cancer cells create new conditions in which normal tissue structure can be
disturbed. Nephronectin, which is the primary ligand for α8β1 integrin, plays an 
important role in kidney development. There are conflicting findings regarding
its role in cancer progression and metastasis, especially in breast carcinoma.
The aim of this study was to determine changes in nephronectin expression in
primary tumor tissues and metastatic visceral organs, using metastatic and
non-metastatic cell lines in a mouse model of breast cancer. In our study,
4T1-Liver Metastatic and 4T1-Heart Metastatic cells, originally derived from
4T1-murine breast carcinoma, and non-metastatic 67NR carcinoma cells were used.
Cancer cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary gland of 8-10 week-old
Balb-c mice. Primary tumors, lung, liver tissues were collected on 12th and 25th 
days after the tumor injection. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine
expression of nephronectin in tissues. We also investigated the expression levels
of the protein by using western blot technique. We found that lung and liver
tissue of control animals (not-injected with tumor cells) expressed nephronectin 
which was lost in animals bearing metastatic tumor for 25 days. In accordance,
nephronectin staining of lung and liver was preserved in animals injected with
non-metastatic 67NR tumors. These results demonstrate that loss of nephronectin
may play an important role in formation metastatic milieu for cancer cells. This 
is the first study demonstrating that tumor-induced loss of nephronectin
expression in visceral organs in which metastatic growth takes place.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare nonaspiration (NAS) and aspiration (AS)
techniques in the evaluation of fine-needle cytology of lymph node (FNC-LN) in
terms of diagnostic adequacy of cytologic material.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three superficial cervical LNs in 75 patients who
underwent NAS and AS-FNC-LN in the same visit were evaluated. Cytological results
were categorized as diagnostic and nondiagnostic.
RESULTS: The rates of malignancy were 13.8% in AS versus 16.3% in NAS technique, 
whereas nondiagnostic cytology was detected in 43.1% and 25.2%, respectively
(P = .549 and P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic adequacy rate in NAS-FNC-LN was significantly higher 
than AS-FNC-LN. However, NAS technique seems to be more simple and comfortable.
We suggest both NAS and AS-FNC-LN in cytologic evaluation of suspicious cervical 
LNs until the diagnostic accuracy is determined with prospective studies.

INTRODUCTION: Hydatid disease is an endemic parasitic infection caused by
Echinococcus granulosus mostly seen in the Mediterranean countries. The most
affected organ is the liver, however hydatidosis can be found anywhere in the
human body.
METHODS: The records of patients who were diagnosed with hydatid disease in our
hospital from December 2005 to February 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. The
cases were evaluated and recorded depending on their gender, age and the
localization of the cysts.
RESULTS: A total of 329 patients diagnosed over a 10-year period were included in
our study. There were 202 females (61.4%) and 127 males (38.6%). The hydatid
cysts were located in the liver in 257 (78.1%) patients and in unusual locations 
in 72 (21.9%) patients. The most common unusual site for hydatid cysts was the
spleen followed by bones, central nervous system, soft tissue, the kidney and the
gall bladder. Amongst these 72 patients who had hydatid cysts in unusual
locations; 33 patients had concomitant liver hydatidosis, whereas 39 patients had
primary involvement of unusual sites. Two patients with malignancies also had
hydatid cysts in different locations.
CONCLUSION: Hydatid disease affects many organs in the body and therefore it can 
pose a major diagnostic dilemma and it may mimic other entities. In endemic
areas, a differential diagnosis of hydatid disease should be considered for
cystic masses in any anatomical location.

Clinicopathologic characteristics of paraduodenal (groove) pancreatitis (PDP)
remain to be fully unraveled. In this study, 47 PDPs with preoperative enhanced
images available were subjected to detailed comparative analysis in conjunction
with pathologic findings. PDP were predominantly in males (3:1) with a mean age
of 50 years, and 60% had a preoperative diagnosis of cancer. Mean lesional size
was 3.1 cm. Three distinct subtypes were identified by imaging. Solid-tumoral
(type-1) with groove-predominant (type-1A, 36%) forming a distinct solid band
between the duodenum and pancreas often with histologic microabscesses (69% vs.
33% in others), and pancreas-involving (type-1B, 19%) forming a pseudotumoral
mass spanning into the head-groove area, always diagnosed preoperatively as
"cancer," but often lacked parenchymal atrophy of the body (44% vs. 92%).
Cyst-forming (type-2) had groove-predominant (type-2A, 15%), often accompanied by
Brunner gland hyperplasia, and pancreas-predominant (type-2B, 15%) were in
younger (mean: 44 y) females (57% vs. 18%) and had less alcohol/tobacco abuse
(50/33% vs. 81/69%). Ill-defined (type-3; 15%) often had main pancreatic duct
dilatation (mean: 5.6 vs. 2.8 mm). The capricious presentations of PDP could be
attributed to variable effects of different mechanistic and precipitative
etiopathogenetic factors such as disturbed accessory duct outflow (dilated
Santorini duct, 87%), aggravated by alcohol (77%) with superimposed stasis in the
main ampulla (previous cholecystectomy, 47%; choledocholithiasis, 9%), strictured
Wirsung duct (68%), and some likely exacerbated by ischemia (hypertension [59%], 
tobacco abuse [64%], arteriosclerosis in the tissue [23%]). In conclusion, our
study identified 3 distinct types of PDP and each may reflect different
pathogenetic contributing factors.

BACKGROUND: Thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4) is a protein that is linked to a number of
important biological actions and recently tumor progression and poor prognosis of
some tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate Tβ4 expression in gastric
GISTs and correlate with some clinicopathological characteristics related with
prognosis and clinical outcome in order to add further data to the current
literature.
METHODS: Tβ4 antibody was applied to the 4μm-thick paraffin sections of 57
gastric GISTs by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Tβ4 expression was found to be directly corrrelated with higher risk
groups, tumor size, mitotic count, cellularity, and necrosis while it was
inversely correlated with overall survival (OS) by univariate analysis (p=0.000, 
p=0.001, p=0.000, p=0.025, p=0.023, and p=0.042, respectively). The direct
association between Tβ4 expression and risk groups were also supported by
multivariate analysis (p=0.000, β=0.497, t=4.374).
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of Tβ4 was found to be related with predictive
characteristics for tumor progression and adverse prognosis. Thus, we suggest
that overexpression of Tβ4 might play a role in the progression of gastric GISTs 
and might be used as a potential prognostic tool as well as a target for novel
therapies.

OBJECTIVE: The Bethesda classification was introduced in 2008 to provide
standardisation in the evaluation of thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology
(FNAC). We compared the diagnostic value of pre-Bethesda and Bethesda
classification systems in the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid
nodules.
METHODS: Medical records of patients who underwent a thyroidectomy between June
2007 and June 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Nodules evaluated with FNAC
before March 2010 were classified as pre-Bethesda (non-diagnostic, benign,
indeterminate, suspicious for malignancy and malignant), and those evaluated
after March 2010 were considered Bethesda (non-diagnostic, benign, atypia of
undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance,
follicular neoplasia/suspicious for follicular neoplasia, suspicious for
malignancy and malignant). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of the two classification
systems were calculated.
RESULTS: There were 1810 nodules in the pre-Bethesda and 5115 nodules in the
Bethesda group. The non-diagnostic rate was significantly higher, and benign and 
suspicious for malignancy rates were lower in Bethesda compared with the
pre-Bethesda group (P<.001 for each). When benign cytology was considered
negative, and indeterminate, follicular neoplasia/suspicious for follicular
neoplasia, suspicious for malignancy and malignant cytologies were considered
positive, results for pre-Bethesda and Bethesda were as follows: sensitivity,
78.9% and 78.5%; specificity, 86.6% and 97.0%; PPV, 42.8% and 72.6%; NPV, 97% and
97.8%; and accuracy, 85.7% and 95.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Among operated nodules, percentages of benign and suspicious for
malignancy cytologies decreased, and percentages of non-diagnostic and uncertain 
cytologies increased with the implementation of Bethesda. The diagnostic value of
FNAC seems to have increased with the use of Bethesda classification.

Childhood enteropathies are a group of diseases causing severe chronic
(>2-3 weeks) diarrhoea often starting in the first week of life with the
potential for fatal complications for the affected infant. Early identification
and accurate classification of childhood enteropathies are, therefore, crucial
for making treatment decisions to prevent life-threatening complications.
Childhood enteropathies are classified into four groups based on the underlying
pathology: (i) conditions related to defective digestion, absorption and
transport of nutrients and electrolytes; (ii) disorders related to enterocyte
differentiation and polarization; (iii) defects of enteroendocrine cell
differentiation; and (iv) disorders associated with defective modulation of
intestinal immune response. While the intestinal mucosa is usually normal in
enteropathies related to congenital transport or enzyme deficiencies, the
intestinal biopsy in other disorders may reveal a wide range of abnormalities
varying from normal villous architecture to villous atrophy and/or inflammation, 
or features specific to the underlying disorder including epithelial
abnormalities, lipid vacuolization in the enterocytes, absence of plasma cells,
lymphangiectasia, microorganisms, and mucosal eosinophilic or histiocytic

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to determine the malignancy
risk for nodules categorised as atypia or follicular lesions of undetermined
significance atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of
undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) and to investigate the predictors of
malignancy.
METHODS: All nodules diagnosed as AUS/FLUS on fine needle aspiration (FNAs)
performed between January 2011 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed.
Clinical data, ultrasonographic features, follow-up data and the final
pathological results were recorded. After further exclusion, only nodules that
underwent surgical excision were included in the final analysis. The malignancy
rate and the range of malignancy rates were calculated. Clinical and ultrasound
features were examined to determine the predictors of malignancy.
RESULTS: During the study period, FNA was performed on 9938 nodules, and 1019
(10.2%) nodules were diagnosed as AUS/FLUS. After further exclusion, 976 nodules 
were evaluated. After the initial diagnosis of AUS/FLUS, 139 (14.2%) patients
underwent surgery, 518 (53.1%) had repeated FNAs. A total of 305 (31%) had
undergone surgical excision at different time points. For surgically confirmed
nodules, the malignancy rate after the initial FNA was 34.5% (the lower and upper
thresholds for the malignancy rate were 19.3% and 66.3%, respectively), and 37.9%
after the repeated FNA. No ultrasound feature was determined as a predictor,
whereas age (>55 years) was a predictor for malignancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall malignancy rate for nodules diagnosed as AUS/FLUS and
the malignancy rate for nodules that underwent repeated FNA after AUS/FLUS were
higher than the expected malignancy rates of the National Cancer Institute. It
is, therefore, suggested that the current recommendations should be reconsidered.

BACKGROUND: Microvillous inclusion disease (MVID) is one of the most severe
congenital diarrhea disorders, caused by a genetic defect in enterocyte
differentiation and polarization.
CASE REPORT: We describe a neonate who presented with severe weight loss,
hypernatremic dehydration and metabolic acidosis due to intractable diarrhea due 
to MVID, confirmed by electron microscopy.
CONCLUSION: MVID can present with severe weight loss, hypernatremic dehydration
and metabolic acidosis that is life threatening. The diagnosis is made by typical
findings on light microscopy and electron microscope of small bowel biopsies. The
only therapeutic options at this time are total parenteral nutrition and bowel
rest and intestinal transplantation.

Leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei (LBN) have significant cytologic atypia, but high
mitotic rate and tumor cell necrosis are absent. Although it is a benign
leiomyoma variant, recurrent cases have been described. In this study, we
investigated the clinical and pathologic features of LBN and compared them with
related studies. A total of 30 patients diagnosed with LBN in our department were
included in this study. In all cases, clinical data (age, complaint, surgery
type), macroscopic features (size, location, number of leiomyomas, necrosis, and 
hemorrhage), microscopic features (bizarre cell distribution, bizarre cell
density, cellularity, mitotic rate, tumor margin, necrosis, nuclear
pseudoinclusions, karyorrhectic nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with
perinucleolar clearing, cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions, staghorn vessels,
and alveolar-type edema), and follow-up data (recurrence and survival period)
were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 49.76 yr (range: 38-89 yr).
Twenty-two patients (73%) had undergone hysterectomy and 8 patients (27%) had
undergone myomectomy. The mean tumor diameter was 6.12 cm (range: 0.5-25 cm). The
tumor was intramural in 11 patients (37%), subserosal in 7 patients (23%), and
submucosal in 4 patients (13%). Microscopically, the bizarre cell distribution
was focal in 8 patients (27%), multifocal in 12 patients (40%), and diffuse in 10
patients (33%). Bizarre cell density was low in 15 patients (50%), intermediate
in 8 patients (27%), and high in 7 patients (23%). The mean mitotic count was 1.4
(0-4) in 10 high-power fields, and the tumor margin was regular in all cases. We 
observed pseudoinclusions in 24 of 30 (80%) tumors, karyorrhectic nuclei in 21 of
30 tumors (70%), prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with perinucleolar clearing in
12 tumors (40%), cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions in 11 tumors (37%), staghorn
vessels in 9 tumors (30%), and alveolar-type edema in 9 tumors (30%). In
addition, we examined the follow-up records of 26 patients (average duration:
58.1 mo). One patient had a smooth muscle tumor in the L3-L4 paravertebral region
at 67 mo after hysterectomy. This tumor did not share similar microscopic and
immunohistochemical findings to the patient's earlier uterine tumor. The
definitive diagnosis of uterine smooth muscle tumors is important for the
determination of the prognosis of the patient and the most appropriate
therapeutic approach. As in several recent studies, our series has shown that LBN
has a benign clinical course. However, other malignant morphologic criteria such 
as high mitotic rate and tumor cell necrosis should be excluded in the diagnosis 
of LBN.

Coexisting Primary Ovarian and Omental Hydatid Disease Mimicking an Ovarian
Neoplasm: A Case Report.

Hydatid disease is a parasitic infection that most commonly affects the liver and
lungs, although the disease can arise in any part of the body. Cysts may mimic
many benign and malignant conditions. The diagnosis cannot be confirmed
preoperatively in all cases. A 44-yr-old menopausal woman was admitted to the
department of gynecology with complaints of abdominal distention. A fixed
abdominopelvic mass was identified. Radiology revealed a 20-cm mass with branched
septations and solid components. CA-125 level was 55 kU/L, and Risk of Malignancy
Index-2 score was 880. These findings suggested the presence of an ovarian
neoplasm, and laparotomy was performed. Cystic masses measuring 22 cm and 4 cm,
originating from the omentum majus and left ovary, respectively, were found
during surgery. Frozen-section analysis revealed hydatid disease. Infracolic
omentectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy
were performed. Results of a serum Echinococcus hemagglutination test performed
immediately after surgery were negative. The patient was prescribed albendazole
for 6 mo and discharged on the third postoperative day with no complaints. The
incidence of hydatid disease in the female reproductive system is very rare;
however, clinicians must be aware of this disease and take necessary precautions 
while operating because any spillage may lead to anaphylactic shock and increased
risk of recurrence.

Expression of the neonatal splice variant of the voltage-gated sodium channel
α-subunit (VGSC) subtype Nav1.5 (nNav1.5), encoded by the gene SCN5A, was shown
earlier to be upregulated in human breast cancer (BCa), both in vitro and in
vivo. Channel activity promoted BCa invasion of Matrigel®in vitro and metastasis 
in vivo. Consequently, expression of nNav1.5 has been proposed as a functional
biomarker of BCa cells with metastatic potential. Here, we have determined
immunohistochemically both nNav1.5 and total VGSC (tVGSC) protein expression in a
range of adult human tissues. Some VGSC protein was expressed in normal colon,
small intestine, stomach, prostate, bladder and breast. As expected, high levels 
of VGSC protein were expressed in brain, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. On
the other hand, nNav1.5 protein was not expressed in any of the normal tissues
tested except breast where a low-level of protein was present. In comparison to
normal breast, nNav1.5 protein expression in BCa was consistently widespread and 
occurred at a significantly higher level. We also questioned whether there was
any relationship between the nNav1.5 protein expression and the estrogen receptor
(ERα) status of BCa and obtained the following results. First, all cases lacking 
nNav1.5 were positive for ERα. Second, in all ERα-negative tissues, nNav1.5
protein was expressed in plasma membrane. Third, however, in ERα-positive cases, 
nNav1.5 protein expression was observed in both plasma membrane and cytoplasm. In
conclusion, nNav1.5 protein has a restricted expression pattern among human
tissues. High level expression occurs in BCa and associates with ERα status.
These results further support the proposition that nNav1.5 is a novel biomarker
of metastatic BCa.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to compare the cytomorphological
features and cytopathological diagnoses in thyroid aspiration materials prepared 
by SurePath® (SP) and conventional cytology (CC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) materials from 180 thyroid
nodules were divided into two groups to prepare three conventional smears and one
SP slide. Twenty-nine cytomorphological features of thyroid lesions were compared
in the CC and SP slides. The Kappa coefficiency was determined for each. The
cytopathological diagnosis of CC and SP were compared.
RESULTS: The feature with the lowest Kappa coefficient was the haemorrhagic
background, whereas nuclear molding had the highest Kappa coefficient. The rates 
of the atypical and suspicious cytopathological diagnostic categories were
decreased, whereas the rates of benign and malignant categories were increased in
SP. When the cytopathological diagnoses of CC and SP were compared with the
histopathological diagnoses of the 31 thyroidectomy materials, the results were
similar.
CONCLUSION: The common problems seen in CC, such as an excessive number of
slides, a haemorrhagic background and air drying artefact in the SP method were
not encountered. Through these advantages, the rate of the indeterminate
cytopathological diagnosis was low in SP. In addition to those advantages, the
increased rates of non-diagnostic cases, the difficulty in evaluating the
cytomorphologic features owing to tridimensional structures and the smaller size 
of the cells and the presence of tridimensional structures uninterpreted
microscopically were the disadvantages of SP. The present results showed that SP 
could be used instead of CC in thyroid cytopathology.

We aimed to investigate burnout and posttraumatic stress symptoms in mortuary
staff members who work for the Council of Forensic Medicine where more than 4500 
autopsies are annually performed.The data were collected from 142 mortuary staff 
members from the Council of Forensic Medicine, Turkey. The participants were
divided into the following 4 groups: forensic medicine specialists (n = 40,
28.2%), forensic medicine residents (n = 54, 38.0%), autopsy technicians (n = 24,
16.9%), and other staff members (n = 24, 16.9%). All of the participants
completed a brief sociodemographic form and standardized questionnaires to assess
health symptoms, such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Posttraumatic Symptom 
Screening Scale.Forensic medicine staff members are at risk for developing
psychological health symptoms, such as burnout or posttraumatic stress, due to
work-related stressors. We observed that autopsy technicians seemed to have more 
emotional exhaustion and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, whereas resident
doctors had a lower sense of personal accomplishment.

Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) 
has an effective role in both diagnosis and management of patients with lung
cancer. There are many reasons could cause false positivity on PET/CT.A
60-year-old man was admitted a mass on thorax CT and diagnosed as squamous cell
carcinoma. Lobectomy with lymph node dissection was performed after evaluation of
distant metastases. There were pathological lymph nodes detected on PET/CT at six
month following period. Endobronchial ultrasonography guided transbronchial
needle aspiration was performed for differantial diagnosis. The pathologic
diagnosis was granuloma which developed in response to suture material. We
interpreted this granulomatous reaction as gossypiboma which developed against
long-left or forgotten suture material. In conclusion, based on this case,
gossypiboma (or granulomatous inflammation in response to foreign bodies) should 
be also considered in differential diagnosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes with
PET positivity in a previously operated patient.

AIMS: Retinoic acid (RA) has a vital importance in order to ensure continuity and
morphology in many tissues. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have significant
roles in proliferation, the formation of cancers, and metastasis. In this study
the effects of RA on MMP-2 production in cells of rat uterus were investigated.
METHODS: Twenty-four adult Spraque Dawley rats were divided into two groups, the 
experimental group was treated with 40mg/kg/day 13-cis RA for 5days by gavage.
Uterine tissue sections were treated with BrdU and MMP-2 antibodies, evaluated
using light microscopy. Tissues were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and evaluated
using transmission electron miroscopy.
RESULTS: MMP-2 immunoreactivity decreased in the stromal cells compared with the 
control group and no staining of MMP-2 was observed in glandular epithelium in
the experimental group. BrDU labeling of cells showed significant decrease in
RA-treated group versus control group cells. Based on the electron microscopy
evaluation, the surface epithelial cells of the experimental group showed
vacuolization, and an accumulation of lipofuscin bodies was also observed in the 
gland epithelium. Cells involving autophagic vacuoles contained excess lipid
granules in the entire uterus layers especially localized at the border of the
endometrium and myometrium.
CONCLUSION: RA had negative effects on cell proliferation and cell morphology and
inhibited MMP-2 expression.

Sclerosing stromal tumors of the ovary are very rare. We report the case of a
29-year-old pregnant woman who presented with a history of preterm labor and
gestational hypertension. A huge mass measuring 30 cm in greatest dimension was
recognized on the right ovary during cesarean section. Signet ring cell
infiltration was seen during intraoperative frozen section consultation. She
underwent a right salpingo-oophorectomy, and the permanent diagnosis was
sclerosing stromal tumor infiltrated by signet ring cells. Pregnancy-related
changes were seen in tumor morphology. Signet ring cells were immunoreactive with
antibodies MUC5ac, MUC2, and EMA. Thus, stromal cells were immunoreactive with
antibodies inhibin and calretinin. Endoscopic biopsy of the stomach showed a
signet ring cell carcinoma, from which the metastasis had originated. This is the
first reported case in the literature, and is notable for its challenging
differential diagnosis, which included a pregnancy luteoma and primary signet
ring stromal tumor of the ovary.

Residents' career choices and professional motivation can be affected from
perception of their role and recognition within a medical team as well as their
educational and workplace experiences. To evaluate pathology trainees'
perceptions of their pathology residency, we conducted a 42-item survey via a
web-based link questioning respondents' personal and institutional background,
workplace, training conditions, and job satisfaction level. For the 208 residents
from different European countries who responded, personal expectations in terms
of quality of life (53%) and scientific excitement (52%) were the most common
reasons why they chose and enjoy pathology. Sixty-six percent were satisfied
about their relationship with other people working in their department, although 
excessive time spent on gross examination appeared less satisfactory. A set
residency training program (core curriculum), a set annual scientific curriculum,
and a residency program director existed in the program of 58, 60, and 69%
respondents, respectively. Most respondents (76%) considered that pathologists
have a direct and high impact on patient management, but only 32% agreed that
pathologists cooperate with clinicians/surgeons adequately. Most (95%) found that
patients barely know what pathologists do. Only 22% considered pathology and
pathologists to be adequately positioned in their country's health care system.
Almost 84% were happy to have chosen pathology, describing it as "puzzle
solving," "a different fascinating world," and "challenging while being crucial
for patient management." More than two thirds (72%) considered pathology and
pathologists to face a bright future. However, a noticeable number of respondents
commented on the need for better physical working conditions, a better organized 
training program, more interaction with experienced pathologists, and deeper
knowledge on molecular pathology.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) plays a key role in the early evaluation of patients
with thyroid nodules; however, from 15% to 30% of FNA specimens are cytologically
indeterminate. Molecular testing has proven useful when applied to indeterminate 
thyroid FNAs, and its use has been endorsed in the American Thyroid Association
guidelines. In addition to the noncommercial ("in-house") application of v-Raf
murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), rat sarcoma (RAS), rearranged in
transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma (RET/PTC), and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor γ/paired box gene 8 (PPARγ/PAX8) testing, there
are currently 3 commercially available molecular panels that vary in their
relative reported performances, strengths, and limitations. Here, we discuss the 
role of molecular testing for indeterminate thyroid aspirates, taking into
consideration the recent reclassification of the encapsulated follicular variant 
of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) as "noninvasive follicular neoplasm with
papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP)." Cancer Cytopathol 2017;125(6

Our group and others have previously demonstrated the presence of TERT promoter
mutations (TERT-mut) in 60-80% of urothelial carcinomas and some of their
histologic variants. Five other genes have been frequently implicated in bladder 
cancer: FGRF3, TP53, PIK3CA, HRAS, and CDKN2A. In the current study, we sought to
determine the prevalence of mutations in TERT and these five other genes in de
novo papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) of the
urinary bladder. A retrospective search of our archives for PUNLMP was performed 
and 30 de novo cases were identified and included in the study. We found
mutations in TERT (TERT-mut) and FGFR3 (FGFR3-mut) to be the most common
alterations in the cohort (63 and 60%, respectively). The majority of the
TERT-mut-positive tumors (84%) had a g.1295228C > T alteration with the remaining
tumors demonstrating g.1295250C > T. Approximately one fourth of tumors had TP53 
mutations. These findings support the potential utility of a uniform genetic
mutation panel to detect bladder cancers of various subtypes.

BACKGROUND: Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA) is an autosomal
recessive disorder due to mutations in ITGA6 and/or ITGB4, resulting in altered
expression of α6β4 integrin. EB-PA can also occur with aplasia cutis.
CASE REPORT: We present a newborn with EB-PA and aplasia cutis, born of
consanguineous parents, with a homozygous c.3793+1G>A mutation affecting ITGB4,
previously described only in the heterozygous state with other mutations.
CONCLUSION: The previously unreported homozygous c.3793+1G>A mutation affecting
ITGB4 causes a severe form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric
atresia and aplasia cutis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunohistochemical expressions of HIF-1α, CA9 and 
CXCR4 in resected human CRC specimens in relation to clinicopathologic and
prognostic variables.
METHODS: A total of 186 patients (mean(SD) age: 56.7(12.6) years, 54.0% were
males) with colorectal adenocarcinoma were included in this retrospective study. 
Resection specimens of the primary tumor were reviewed to confirm the diagnoses
and the stage of the disease. Data on age, gender, tumor characteristics
(localization, size, macroscopic growth pattern, histologic type, grade,
angiolymphatic invasion, TNM stage), applied treatments and clinical outcome
(overall survival, local recurrence and distant metastasis) were obtained from
the hospital records. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue specimens was
performed to determine HIF-1α, CA9 and CXCR4 expressions.
RESULTS: Overall, 94.0% of cases showed HIF-1α immunoreactivity, 89% showed CXCR4
immunoreactivity, and 15.6% showed CA9 immunoreactivity, while weak expression of
immunohistochemical markers was noted in 51.1%, 93.0% and 50.5% of cases,
respectively. HIF-1α expression was higher among males than in females (median
(min-max) final score of 6 (0-9) vs. 3 (0-9), p=0.013). CA9 expressed at higher
levels in ulcerovegetative and depressed tumors than in polypoid ones [0(0-9) vs.
0(0-6), p=0.039]. CXCR4 expression was significantly higher in tumors <5cm than
≥5cm [6(0-9) vs. 3(0-9), p=0.028] and in grade 1-2 than grade 3 tumors [4(0-9)
vs. 3(0-9), p=0.030]. No significant difference was noted in survival with
respect to strength of HIF-1α, CA9 and CXCR4 immunoreactivity.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings revealed weak-to-moderate HIF-1α and
CXCR4 immunoreactivity in majority of resection samples, and weak CA9
immunoreactivity in majority of CA9 positive cases. Other than gender (HIF-1α),
macroscopic growth pattern (CA9) and tumor size and histologic grade (for CXCR4),
none of the clinicopathologic and prognostic factors investigated were associated
with expression of immunohistochemical markers and level of immunoreactivity had 
no impact on survival.

BACKGROUND: Nephrogenic adenoma is an uncommon benign lesion that occurs at
several sites in urinary tract, from the renal pelvis to urethra, with the
highest frequency in urinary bladder. Nephrogenic adenoma displays a broad
spectrum of architectural and cytological features. Hence, recognition of its
characteristic histopathological features is needed to distinguish this lesion
from its mimickers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective series of 21 cases of nephrogenic adenoma 
in 18 patients, which were diagnosed in our department between 2010 and 2016,
were analyzed. All histological slides were reviewed by two pathologists and the 
diagnosis of each case was confirmed. Immunohistochemistry was performed for
PAX-8 in all cases. CK7, PAX-2, PSA, p53, p63, GATA-3 and α-methylacyl-CoA
racemase (AMACR) were applied in problematic cases.
RESULTS: The most common location of the lesion was urinary bladder (14 patients)
followed by renal pelvis (2 patients), ureter (1 patient) and urethra (1
patient). A history of urothelial carcinoma and repeated TUR procedures were
observed in 12 patients. There were 2 pediatric patients aged 3 years. Both of
them had undergone previous urosurgery because of megaureter in one and bladder
exstrophy in the other. Other clinical antecedents included bladder diverticulum 
(1 patient), cystitis (1 patient) and nephrolithiasis (1 patient). Recurrence of 
lesion was seen in two patients (once in one case and twice in the other one).
The median time to disease recurrence in these patients was 11 months (range,
2-20 months). Histologically, the lesions exhibited various morphological
findings, with mixed (15 cases, 71.4%), pure tubular (3 cases, 14.3%), pure
papillary (2 cases, 9.5%) and pure flat (1 case, 4.8%) growth patterns. Of the 15
cases with mixed patterns, 8 cases were tubulocystic and flat, 3 cases were
tubular and flat, 2 cases were tubular, papillary and flat, 1 case was
tubulocystic, papillary and flat, and 1 case was tubular and papillary. Flat
pattern was observed in 15 cases (71.4%). It was seen in association with other
patterns in 14 cases (mixed morphology) and purely in 1 case. Our findings
suggested that the flat pattern is a frequent finding in nephrogenic adenomas.
Notably one case in this series showed superficial extension into bladder
muscularis propria.
CONCLUSIONS: Histologically nephrogenic adenoma may simulate a variety of
malignancies. Awareness of characteristic morphologic features of nephrogenic
adenoma is needed to diagnose this lesion correctly.

Non-infectious aortitis may be caused by several distinct systemic rheumatologic 
diseases. In some patients, aortitis is identified either pathologically or
radiologically in the absence of clinical evidence of a systemic vasculitis. By
consensus nomenclature, such cases are referred to as clinically isolated
aortitis (CIA). Some systemic disorders may initially present as CIA including
giant cell arteritis (GCA), IgG4-related disease, infectious aortitis, and
granulomatosis with polyangiitis. CIA most commonly occurs in women of European
descent over the age of 50 and, thus, mirrors the gender, age, and geographic
distribution of GCA. CIA most often demonstrates a granulomatous/giant cell
pattern of inflammation (GPI), and CIA-GPI is pathologically indistinguishable
from aortitis due to GCA. In many cases, CIA may be a manifestation of
extracranial GCA. CIA is being identified both pathologically in resected aortic 
tissue and radiologically by computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance
imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. However, there
appears to be significant differences between pathologically defined CIA and
radiologically defined CIA. Multiple studies have shown that patients with CIA
are at increased risk for subsequent aortic events (new aneurysms or dissections)
and thus it is recommended to monitor these patients with periodic aortic
imaging. While the data is currently limited, there is increasing evidence that
at least some patients with CIA may benefit from immunosuppressive therapy.

Our aim in this study was to describe the clinical, morphological, and molecular 
profile of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) metastatic to bone. We analyzed 
the morphological, phenotypic, and molecular characteristics of seven cases, and 
in addition reviewed 17 cases from literature. Sequence analysis of KIT and
PDGFRA genes was possible for six cases. For the GIST cases with bone metastasis,
the most common primaries were small intestine (29%), stomach (25%), and rectum
(21%). Sites of bone metastases were vertebrae (11), pelvis (8), femur (8), ribs 
(6), humerus (5), skull (3), scapula (1), and mandible (1). The size ranged from 
1.5 to 13 cm (median, 3.8 cm). Bone metastases without involvement of any other
organ were seen in 17% of the cases and were solitary in 14 (58%). Adjacent soft 
tissue involvement was present in nearly half of the patients. Bone metastasis
was either manifest at the time of diagnosis (28%) or occurred after a mean
period of 4.7 years (3 months-20 years). Morphologically, neoplastic cells were
spindle in 67%, epithelioid in 13%, and mixed epithelioid and spindle in 20%.
CD117, DOG1, and CD34 were positive in 88, 86, and 85% of the cases,
respectively. KIT Exon 11 mutations were the most frequent gene alteration (78%),
followed by KIT Exon 13 mutations. Of 17 of the cases with available follow-up
information, 7 (41%) patients developed bone metastasis under imatinib therapy.
Five patients (29%) died of disease within a mean of 17 months. Bone metastases
from GIST are usually found in patients with advanced disease and typically
present as lytic masses with occasional soft tissue involvement. We could not
identify any KIT or PDGFRA alterations predisposing to bone metastasis.

The acute phase effects of toluene on the brain have been investigated in this
study using rabbit brain via histopathological, immunohistochemical, and
biochemical methods. A total of 20 male rabbits were used as control and
experimental groups. Moreover, nerve growth factor (NGF), tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), dopamine (DA), and glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) tests were performed in order to designate the severity of the biochemical
damage. In the biochemical evaluation of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus,
hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and entorhinal cortex, the TNF-alpha levels in
the brain were found to be significantly higher than in the control group. Levels
of dopamine, secreted from the substantia nigra, nerve growth factor (NGF)
developed from the hippocampal neurons, and GFAP, secreted from astrocyte cells, 
were detected to be significantly lower in the toluene-administration group than 
in the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, areas of focal vacuolar
degeneration (abscess formation), gliosis, and perivascular demyelination, many
pyknotic cells and necrosis were observed. In the toluene-administration group
compared to the control group, distinct excessive expansions of the blood vessels
and severe degeneration in the structure of cells and also dispersed cell borders
were observed. Furthermore, abnormal malformations of the nuclei structure of the
oligodendrocyte cells were seen. Bodies of the sequential neurons of the
hippocampus in the toluene-administration group were distinctly structurally
damaged compared to the control group. In addition, cytoplasm of the cortex cell 
showed serious immune reactivity in the experimental group.

Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare, relatively
less chemosensitive sarcoma. We report clinicopathologic features of 11
epithelioid MPNSTs, including rare forms, along with INI1 immunostaining and BRAF
V600E mutation results. BRAF V600E mutation was tested by Real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) technique. Eleven tumors occurred in six men and five women 
(M:F ratio = 0.85:1) within an age range of 5-73 years (average = 44), mostly in 
lower limbs (five), followed by upper limbs (four). Tumor size (n = 6), varied
from 3.1 to 15 cm (average = 8.3). Histopathologically, most tumors were
multilobular, characterized by epithelioid to round-shaped, malignant cells,
along with spindle cells (three cases), "rhabdoid-like" cells (seven cases) and
pleomorphic giant cells (single case). By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were 
positive for S100 protein (11/11) (100%), EMA (3/7) (42.8%), pan CK(2/7) (28.5%),
and HMB45 (1/11) (9%), while these were negative for Melan A (0/11) and INI1
(3/11), including a single tumor, displaying HMB45 positivity. BRAF V600E
mutation was positive in 1/8 cases, that lacked melanocytic marker expression.
All patients (n = 5) were treated by surgical resection. During follow-up (n = 8,
median duration = 23 months), four patients developed tumor recurrences and four 
developed metastasis, mostly to lymph nodes (3). Finally, four patients were
alive with disease, two were alive with no evidence of disease, and two patients 
died of disease. Epithelioid MPNSTs have a diverse histopathologic spectrum. Loss
of INI1 is useful, including in identifying rare forms of epithelioid MPNST,
displaying melanocytic differentiation. Most tumors are treated by surgical
resection. Loss of INI1 and the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in some cases
raises future possibility of exploring targeted therapy in those, rare
epithelioid MPNSTs.

BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most widespread
cancer types that arise from different sites of oral cavity and has a 5-year
survival rate. This study is aimed at investigating the human oxoguanine
glycosylase 1 (hOGG1)-Ser326Cys and APE-Asp148Glu polymorphisms of DNA repair
genes in OSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the hOGG1-Ser326Cys and APE-Asp148Glu
polymorphisms of DNA repair genes in the oral cavity. Genotyping was conducted
using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
based on 132 patients who were diagnosed as having OSCC and 160 healthy subjects.
RESULTS: Individuals with the genotype hOGG1-Ser326Cys, Cys allele carriers, were
found significantly more frequently in the patient group compared to the control 
group as increase in risk (p < 0.001). Furthermore, it was observed that there
were significantly more individuals with the Ser allele in the control group (p <
0.001). Individuals with genotype APE-Asp148Glu were not statistically
significant; however, they were still more in the control group and provided
protection against the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that hOGG1-Ser326Cys Cys allele is statistically 
important and relevant with respect to the development of oral squamous cancer.
In view of our results, further studies including expression levels are required 
in which hOGG1-Ser326Cys should be investigated as molecular biomarkers for the
early prediction of squamous cell carcinoma.

Bilim University, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the diagnostic utility of micronuclei (MN) and
nuclear buds (NBs) in aspiration smears of the well-differentiated epithelial
lesions of thyroid.
METHODS: One hundred five cases composed of 34 follicular nodular disease (FND), 
31 Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), and 40 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were
compiled retrospectively. May- Grünwald Giemsa (MGG) stained smears of each case 
were selected to count cells with nuclear protrusions (NPs) per 1000 cells. The
frequency of cells with NPs (MN&NBs) was compared by using Mann-Whitney U test
and Kruskal-Wallis tests when appropriate. Post-Hoc Tukey test was used for
pairwise comparison of different diagnostic categories. By running a ROC curve
analysis, diagnostic usefulness of the frequency of cells with NPs (MN&NBs) and
their cut-off values to predict malignant behavior were calculated. P < 0.05 was 
regarded as significant.
RESULTS: NPs (MN&NBs) were significantly more frequent in malignant cases than
benign ones. NBs were more frequent in conventional PTC compared to FV of PTC,
but the frequency of MN did not significantly differ between these. ROC curve
analysis revealed that evaluation of the frequency of cells with NPs (MN&NBs) was
a highly specific, sensitive, and diagnostically useful method to identify
malignant behavior.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the
literature to evaluate the frequency of cells with NPs (MN&NBs) in human thyroid 
aspiration smears. Our results show that evaluation of NPs (MN&NBs) may be a
useful diagnostic tool to detect PTC in thyroid aspiration smears. Diagn.

BACKGROUND: Renal anastomosing hemangioma (RAH) is a very rare distinct entity
composed of anastomosing sinusoidal (spleen-like) capillary-sized vessels lined
by flat or hobnail endothelial cells. Most of the published cases of RAH occurred
in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
METHODS: We present 2 cases of RAH in ESRD along with a literature review. We
compared clinicopathologic features of RAHs in end-stage and non-end-stage
kidneys. A meta-analysis was conducted with PubMed and a manual search through
references of relevant publications. Individual patient data gathered from the
literature were used in the analysis.
RESULTS: Our systematic review revealed 49 RAHs, including our 2 cases.
Thirty-two (65.3%) cases were in ESRD, only 17 (34.7%) were in patients with
non-ESRD. RAHs in ESRD were in younger patients, smaller in size, multifocal, and
seen more with renal epithelial neoplasms when compared with RAHs in non-ESRD ( P
< .05). Extramedullary hematopoiesis was seen mostly in RAHs in ESRD kidneys (85%
vs 41.7%) ( P = .018). Follow-up data were available for 25 cases with a mean
follow-up of 24.58 ± 38.54 months. Recurrence, metastasis, or death have never
been described related to RAH in any patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, RAHs are rare and mostly arise in kidneys with
end-stage damage. RAHs in ESRD and non-ESRD differ in terms of clinicopathologic 
features.

Objectives: We report a rare case of CD4- cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid
dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) with a novel PBRM1 mutation.
Methods: An 11-year-old girl presented with an enlarged mass on her left arm and 
underwent an incisional biopsy.
Results: Histopathologic examination and immunohistochemistry studies showed a
monotonous proliferation of blasts that were CD4-, CD56+, and CD123+. There was
no evidence of leukemic dissemination. Next-generation sequencing detected PBRM1 
and CIC gene abnormalities. We confirmed and validated a novel PBRM1 mutation by 
conventional polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing.
Conclusions: CD4- variant of BPDCN may be mistaken for myeloid sarcoma or
extramedullary lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma because of their overlapping
morphologic and immunophenotypic features; thus, a careful clinicopathologic
evaluation is essential to reach the correct diagnosis. PBRM1 mutation seems to
be a driver event in this case. Our study underscores the importance of
alterations in chromatin remodeling in the pathogenesis of BPDCN.

Tumor draining sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the sites of selective changes as 
compared to non-SLNs. They show features of tumor-reactive lymphadenopathy,
including increased total number of functional blood vessels, but a relative
immunosuppressed status has also been described in them. We explored the
hypothesis of a selective regression or non-regression in SLNs versus non-SLNs in
142 patients with 110 estrogen receptor-positive and 32 estrogen
receptor-negative tumors undergoing both SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node
dissection after neoadjuvant therapy by assessing the tumoral (metastatic) and
regression statuses of SLNs and non-SLNs separately. Of the 89 cases with signs
of nodal regression, 22 cases (25%) were in favor of a selective non-regression
in SLNs, 18 cases (20%) were supportive of a selective and more pronounced
regression in the SLNs and the remaining showed equal degrees of regression or
non-regression in SLNs and non-SLNs. The results indicate that there is no
obvious difference in the degree of regressive histological changes shown by SLNs
and NSLNs. Therefore, this phenomenon may not be a major contributor to the
higher false negative rate of SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant treatment.

BACKGROUND: The columnar cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC-CCV) is
a rare entity that demonstrates a more aggressive clinical course compared with
the more common subtypes of PTC. On histology, it is defined by papillae or
gland-like structures lined by columnar cells displaying prominent nuclear
stratification. Because to the authors' knowledge no characteristic
cytomorphological features have been identified to date and typical features of
PTC often are absent on cytology, the diagnosis of PTC-CCV by fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) is challenging. This prompted the authors to evaluate a series
of PTC-CCV cases to identify features that could facilitate its diagnosis by FNA.
METHODS: A total of 11 surgical specimens of PTC-CCV with corresponding
preoperative cytology were identified over a 21-year period. The cytological
features of the aspirated specimens, consisting mostly of Papanicolaou and
Diff-Quick smears, were evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: All cases demonstrated the presence of papillary structures. The most
important features observed in PTC-CCV FNA specimens were hypercellularity with
nuclear superposition and a paucity of nuclear pseudoinclusions and grooves.
CONCLUSIONS: Although PTC-CCV may demonstrate features that overlap with those of
the classic variant of PTC, hypercellular smears with papillary structures
covered by cells with pseudostratified nuclei that show a paucity of nuclear
pseudoinclusions and grooves should alert the cytopathologist to the possibility 
of this diagnosis. Cancer Cytopathol 2017;125:389-97. © 2017 American Cancer

Hospital , Izmir , Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: The emergency contraceptive ulipristal acetate (UPA) 30 mg is
increasingly used by women, but there is no published data on UPA exposure in
pregnancy.
CASE REPORT: Here we describe five cases of unintended pregnancies following the 
use of UPA for emergency contraception. Of five pregnant women exposed to UPA,
one decided to terminate the pregnancy for personal reasons. Two of them
experienced premature rupture of membranes and the babies were born large for
gestational age (LGA). The other two women experienced gestational diabetes, and 
one of them also delivered a LGA baby. The blood glucose levels of the mothers
were normal after delivery and at six weeks postpartum. No birth defects and no
growth or developmental abnormalities for the infants were reported during
6 months follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women inadvertently exposed to UPA should be monitored
carefully, unless further data are available.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine lipid peroxidation products
and antioxidant enzyme activity in umbilical cord blood of small for gestational 
age (SGA) neonates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Umbilical cord arterial blood samples were collected from 
21-term singleton SGA newborn infants and 21 age- and sex-matched appropriate for
gestational age (AGA) term neonates prospectively born by elective cesarean
section for determination of malondialdehyde (MDA) as a marker of lipid
peroxidation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) for antioxidant activity.
RESULTS: MDA levels were increased (5.20 vs. 3.52 nmol/mL; p < 0.001), while
levels of SOD (6.24 vs. 8.99 U/mL; p < 0.01) were decreased in SGA neonates when 
compared with AGA newborn infants.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated MDA levels and decreased SOD activity in umbilical cord
blood may show the possibility of insufficient protective mechanisms against
increased oxidative stress in SGA neonates born by cesarean section.

Ischemia-Modified Albumin as a Marker of Acute Coronary Syndrome: The Case for
Revising the Concept of "N-Terminal Modification" to "Fatty Acid Occupation" of
Albumin.

Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is assumed "N-terminal modified" albumin which is
generated immediately following myocardial ischemia. The diagnosis of IMA is
based on reduced cobalt binding affinity to albumin which is attributed mainly to
incapability of cobalt to bind at albumin's modified N-terminus. Although the
albumin cobalt binding test was accepted as a potentially powerful marker for
discriminating acute coronary syndrome from nonischemic chest pain, its
usefulness has been brought into question in recent years. Patients with acutely 
ischemic myocardium exhibit a rapid increase in serum levels of fatty acids
(FAs). Almost all released FAs are strongly bound to albumin which create
conformational changes in the protein with resultant reduced cobalt binding
affinity. There is a clear metabolic and temporal relationship between IMA
measured via albumin cobalt binding testing and serum levels of FAs. In line with
what has been suggested recently in the literature, we conclude that a shift from
the concept of "N-terminal modified" to "FA-occupied" albumin is required, as
this better describes IMA in patients with acute coronary syndrome. We also offer
"oxidation modified albumin, OMA," which is conceptually different from the
"FA-occupied" IMA, to describe modification of albumin in chronic disease
associated with increased oxidative stress.

CIC-DUX4 gene fusion, resulting from either a t(4;19) or t(10;19) translocation, 
is the most common genetic abnormality detected in EWSR1-negative small blue
round cell tumors. Following their discovery it was debated if these tumors
should be classified as variants of Ewing sarcoma (ie, atypical Ewing sarcoma) or
as a stand-alone pathologic entity. As such the WHO classification temporarily
grouped the CIC-rearranged tumors under undifferentiated sarcomas with round cell
phenotype, until further clinical evidence was available. However, most studies
reported so far include small series with limited follow-up information, which
preclude a more definitive assessment. The present work investigates the
clinicopathologic features of a large cohort of sarcomas with CIC gene
rearrangement, to define their clinical presentation, morphologic spectrum, and
outcome. Our study further examines the overall survival of the CIC-positive
cohort compared with a control group of EWSR1-rearranged Ewing sarcoma matched
for age and stage. The study cohort included 115 patients, with a mean age of 32 
years and a slight male predominance. Most tumors occurred in the soft tissue
(86%), predominantly deep-seated and equally divided among trunk and extremity,
followed by visceral locations (12%) and rarely in the bone (3%).
Microscopically, most tumors showed round to ovoid cytomorphology but half of the
cases showed also focal areas of spindling and epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype,
with frequent myxoid stromal changes. Variable CD99 reactivity was seen in 84%
cases, with a diffuse pattern only in 23% of cases, whereas nuclear WT1 was seen 
in 92%. A CIC-DUX4 fusion was detected in 57% of cases, with either DUX4 on 4q35 
(35%) or on 10q26 in 25 (22%) cases. No FOXO4 gene rearrangements were present in
39 cases tested. Clinical follow-up was available in 57 patients, with a 5-year
survival of 43%, which was significantly lower than the 77% 5-year survival in
the control Ewing sarcoma group (P=0.002). Our findings show that CIC-DUX4
sarcomas occur most commonly in young adults within the somatic soft tissues,
having a wide spectrum of morphology including round, epithelioid and spindle
cells, and associated with an aggressive clinical course, with an inferior
overall survival compared with Ewing sarcoma. The results support the
classification of CIC-rearranged tumors as an independent molecular and clinical 
subset of small blue round cell tumors distinct from Ewing sarcoma.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between microcystic,
elongated, and fragmented (MELF) pattern and other prognostic factors and lymph
node involvement, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS) using a
case-control group consisting of grade I-II endometrioid endometrial carcinoma
(EEC) patients with/without lymph node involvement. The files of the patients
were searched electronically for all hysterectomy specimens with a diagnosis of
grade I-II EEC of the uterine body from January 1, 2008 to July 31, 2014. Lymph
node involvement was detected in 27 patients who were histologically diagnosed
with grade I-II EEC, and these patients made up the case group. Using a dependent
random sampling method, 28 grade I-II EEC patients without lymph node involvement
were selected. According to multivariate regression analysis, lymphovascular
space invasion [odds ratio, 23.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4-223.5] and
MELF pattern (odds ratio, 13.3; 95% CI, 1.4-121.8) were significant predictors of
lymph node involvement. There was recurrence in 15.8% of cases that showed a MELF
pattern and in 19.4% of those that did not (P=0.738). According to Kaplan-Meier
analysis, the MELF pattern revealed no significant differences in disease-free
survival (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.1-36.5), whereas the effect on OS was
significant (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2). The presence of MELF pattern
was a substantial risk factor for detecting lymph node involvement in patients
with grade I-II EEC. The MELF pattern may be important for identifying which
patients need staging surgery, in addition to its effect on the OS.

Endometrial polyps are benign pathologies originating as localized overgrowths of
basal endometrium. Risk factors include endogenous and exogenous estrogen excess 
and tamoxifen (TAM) exposure. Our main objective was to investigate the role of
an apoptosis-inhibiting protein, survivin, in endometrial polyps. We performed a 
cross-sectional, analytical study; our samples were obtained from the archives of
the Department of Pathology. Sixty samples were included, comprising 20 TAM
polyps, 20 simple endometrial polyps, and 20 cases of simple endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia not associated with TAM use. Immunohistochemical
staining with rabbit monoclonal anti-human survivin, clone EP 119, was performed.
Survivin staining score was highest in the endometrial polyp group and lowest in 
the TAM polyp group (P<0.001). There was no correlation between survivin staining
score and the age of patient (r=0.09), TAM exposure (r=-0.02), nor endometrial
thickness (r=0.25). Endometrial polyps are frequently associated with TAM. The
low expression of the antiapoptotic marker survivin in TAM polyps but high
expression in other polypoid endometrium illustrates that different mechanisms
are responsible in the pathogenesis of endometrial polyps. It is possible that
there is a direct effect of TAM on apoptosis or indirect effect through a
progesterone-related mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can lead to neurogenic pulmonary edema 
(NPE), and chylomicron metabolism may be altered unfavorably in acute lung
injury. This study aimed to investigate the possible effect of NPE on the
development of coronary fat embolism.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 27 rabbits, 5 of which were used as the
control (n=5). Experimental SAH was induced in 15 of the animals by injecting
homologous blood into the cisterna magna, and the remaining 7 animals were
administered only isotonic saline solution (Sham, n=7) in the same manner under
general anesthesia. After 21 days, all the animals were euthanized, and their
hearts, lungs, and brains underwent histopathological examination.
RESULTS: Six animals died of SAH during the experiment, and foamy hemorrhagic
parenchymal lesions and intra-alveolar hemorrhage were observed in their lungs.
The histopathologic findings revealed minimal changes in the lungs, heart, and
brains of the surviving animals; however, an abundant amount of fat globules was 
found in the coronary arteries of the six nonsurviving animals. There was a
meaningful difference between the number of occluded coronary arteries with fatty
globules in the surviving and nonsurviving animals (P<.001). However, the
difference between the survivors and the isotonic-saline-injected group was not
meaningful (P>.05). Coronary fat embolism was an important mortality factor
following SAH (P<.005).
CONCLUSIONS: In SAH-induced NPE, the leakage of chylomicrons into the systemic
circulation may lead to coronary fat embolism, which has not yet been reported in
the literature.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the immunohistochemical
expression of NGF, GDNF and MMP-9 in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), high
grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostate cancer (PC), and
to analyse their association with the clinicopathological parameters in PC cases.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on the tissue microarray (TMA) sections of 30 
BPH, 40 HGPIN and 121 primary PC tissues. There was a significant difference
regarding the expression of NGF and GDNF between PC and HGPIN (p<0.0001;
p<0.0001), and PC and BPH (p=0.001; p<0.0001), but not between HGPIN and BPH
(p>0.05). Furthermore MMP-9 expression was significantly different among all
groups (PC vs. HGPIN, p<0.0001; PC vs. BPH, p<0.0001; HGPIN vs. BPH, p=0.001).
NGF, GDNF and MMP-9 expression was significantly stronger in cases with high
Gleason score (p<0.0001, p=0.004, p<0.0001 respectively) and pT stage (p=0.046,
p=0.004, p=0.001, respectively) in PC cases. All these markers were also
associated with perineural, lymphovascular and extraprostatic invasion (p <0.05).
In addition, a positive correlation was found between NGF and MMP-9 (p<0.0001,
r=0.435), NGF and GDNF (p<0.0001, r=0.634), and GDNF and MMP-9 (p<0.0001,
r=0.670) in PC cases. According to our results we suggest an interaction between 
NGF, GDNF and MMP-9 during the transition to malignancy in PC. Also this
interaction may involve in regulating PC cell differentiation, tumor invasion,
progression, and the agressiveness of PC.

INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a potent anticancer agent; its clinical
use is limited due to its marked cardiotoxicity.
AIM: The present study was aimed at evaluating the cardioprotective effects of
silymarin (SLY) and curcumin (CUR), which have strong antioxidant properties,
against the toxic effects of high-dose CP on the heart of rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 adult Wistar albino female rats were
randomly divided into six groups. Group I (control group; nothing was
administered), Group II (CP group; 30mg/kg/day CP was administered
intraperitoneally to each animal for seven days), Group III (SLY group;
100mg/kg/day SLY by gavage for 14 days), Group IV (CUR group; 100mg/kg/day CUR by
gavage for 14 days), Group V (SLY+CP group; 100mg/kg/day SLY by gavage for 14days
plus 30mg/kg/day CP intraperitoneally starting from the seventh day) and Group VI
(CUR+CP group; 100mg/kg/day CUR by gavage for 14days plus 30mg/kg/day CP
intraperitoneally starting from the seventh day). Biochemical, histopathological 
and immunohistochemical methods were utilised for evaluation of the
cardiotoxicity.
RESULTS: The result showed that an increase in heart MDA and DNA fragmentation
levels were detected while significant decreases were seen in SOD levels in CP
alone group when compared to the other groups. CP caused severe damage in the
histopathological status of heart tissue including intersititial oedema,
haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis in muscle fibrils and perinuclear
vacuolization. A significant increase in the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells
and γH2AX protein expression was detected in the CP-treated group compared to the
control and other treated groups. There was significant increase in the
percentage of caspase 3-positive cells and decrease in the percentage of Bcl-2
positive cells in the CP group compared to the control group and other treated
groups. However, a significant decrease in the percentage of cTnI and cTnT
immunoreactivity was also observed in the CP-treated group compared to the
control and other treated groups. In the groups in which SLY and CUR were
administered concurrently with CP, biochemical parameters, histopathological and 
immunohistochemical results were found to be significantly lower than in the
CP-only group.
CONCLUSIONS: These results lead to conclusion that the natural antioxidant SLY
and CUR might have protective effects against CP-induced cardiotoxicity and
oxidative stress in rats.

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is well known as a principal scaffolding protein of caveolae
which are specialized plasma membrane structures. The role of Cav-1 in
tumorigenesis of breast cancers is relatively less studied. The aim of the
present study is to describe the biological roles of Cav-1 in breast cancers
considering its contrasting dual functions as an oncogene and as a tumor
suppressor. This study included 71 females with breast cancer who had been
histopathologically diagnosed in Private Gunes Pathology Laboratory between the
years 2007, and 2012. The mean age is 52.48 ± 12.8 years. Patients were followed 
up for a mean period of 47.97 ± 20.48 months. We didn't determine Cav-1 positive 
tumor cells. In 36 cases (50.7%), there were stromal expressions of Cav-1. In the
statistical analysis, there was a statistically significant correlation between
Cav-1 expression and ER (p = 0.033), metastasis (p = 0.005), lymphatic invasion
(p = 0.000), nodal metastasis (p = 0,003), perinodal invasion (p = 0.003),
metastasis (p = 0.005) and survival (p = 0.009). We found that Cav-1 expression
is associated with tumor size, histological grade, lymph node involvement.
Accordingly, we have suggested that Cav-1 may be a predictive biomarker for
breast cancer.

Suicides by Jumping Off Istanbul Bridges Linking Asia and Europe.

Yurtseven A(1), Üzün İ, Arslan MN.

Author information: 
(1)From the The Council of Forensic Medicine, The Ministry of Justice of Turkey, 
Istanbul, Turkey.

AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the injury spectrum and
characteristics of people who committed suicide by jumping into water from the
July 15th Martyrs Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridges in Istanbul, Turkey.
METHODS: This study included all of the jumpers from the July 15th Martyrs Bridge
and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge who were autopsied by the Council of Forensic
Medicine, Istanbul Morgue Department, between 2000 and 2013. All of the data were
collected from archived case files. Trauma scores were calculated from the
traumatic findings of the autopsy reports using the New Injury Severity Score
(NISS).
RESULTS: A total of 80 jumping suicides were identified. The male-to-female ratio
was 9:1, and the mean age was 34.06 ± 9.6 years. Most suicides occurred in 2009. 
The suicide rates were higher in the winter, particularly in December. The most
frequent injuries were skin lesions, rib fractures, and lung lacerations. In 12% 
of the cases, the trauma was minor (NISS range, 0-14; mean, 7 ± 5.67), and in 88%
of the cases, it was major (NISS range, 17-66; mean NISS, 44.5 ± 12.46).
CONCLUSION: The sociodemographic features of the jumpers who committed suicide
were quite similar to those reported in previous studies. Preventative measures
(installation of barriers or banning pedestrian access to bridges) reduced the
suicide rate but were not completely effective. Establishing early warning
systems and rescue strategies could save the lives of jumpers who have minor
trauma.

Conventional cytomorphologic assessment is the first step to establish an
accurate diagnosis in urinary cytology. In cytologic preparations, the separation
of low-grade urothelial carcinoma (LGUC) from reactive urothelial proliferation
(RUP) can be exceedingly difficult. The bladder washing cytologies of 32 LGUC and
29 RUP were reviewed. The cytologic slides were examined for the presence or
absence of the 28 cytologic features. The cytologic criteria showing statistical 
significance in LGUC were increased numbers of monotonous single (non-umbrella)
cells, three-dimensional cellular papillary clusters without fibrovascular cores,
irregular bordered clusters, atypical single cells, irregular nuclear overlap,
cytoplasmic homogeneity, increased N/C ratio, pleomorphism, nuclear border
irregularity, nuclear eccentricity, elongated nuclei, and hyperchromasia
(p ˂ 0.05), and the cytologic criteria showing statistical significance in RUP
were inflammatory background, mixture of small and large urothelial cells, loose 
monolayer aggregates, and vacuolated cytoplasm (p ˂ 0.05). When these variables
were subjected to a stepwise logistic regression analysis, four features were
selected to distinguish LGUC from RUP: increased numbers of monotonous single
(non-umbrella) cells, increased nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, hyperchromasia, and
presence of small and large urothelial cells (p = 0.0001). By this logistic model
of the 32 cases with proven LGUC, the stepwise logistic regression analysis
correctly predicted 31 (96.9%) patients with this diagnosis, and of the 29
patients with RUP, the logistic model correctly predicted 26 (89.7%) patients as 
having this disease. There are several cytologic features to separate LGUC from
RUP. Stepwise logistic regression analysis is a valuable tool for determining the
most useful cytologic criteria to distinguish these entities.

In metastatic melanoma, the detection of somatic mutations in the BRAF gene is
crucial regarding patient selection for targeted therapy. Several screening
methods have been developed to identify BRAF gene mutations. In this study, our
objective was to evaluate the detection of the BRAF V600 mutations using two
molecular methods, real-time polymerase chain (real-time PCR) assay and
pyrosequencing, and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and to compare the results of
these different technical platforms. This study included 98 patients diagnosed
with metastatic melanoma at the Hacettepe University, Department of Pathology
between 2002 and 2014. BRAF mutation analysis was tested with real-time PCR,
pyrosequencing and IHC methods. The results of all three tests were compared with
a reference test, and the sensitivity, specificity rates and kappa coefficient
values were analysed for each test. We successfully analysed BRAF mutations using
all three methods in 92 patients. According to our findings, the pyrosequencing
method had the highest kappa value regarding the determination of BRAF V600
mutations. The kappa values were at almost perfect agreement levels in
pyrosequencing and real-time PCR assay (kappa coefficient for
pyrosequencing=0.895 (95% CI: 0.795-0.995); kappa coefficient for real-time
PCR=0.871 (95% CI: 0.761-0.981). The kappa value was at a substantial agreement
level in the IHC analysis (kappa coefficient=0.776 (95% CI: 0.629-0.923).
According to our results, we found that real-time PCR and pyrosequencing methods 
were equally excellent in determination of BRAF V600 mutations. The IHC method,
which is commonly used in routine pathology practice, can also be safely used as 
a screening test for determination of BRAF V600 mutations.

GATA3, as a transcription factor, is associated with estrogen receptor (ER)
expression and necessary for luminal cell differentiation in mammary glands.
Association of GATA3 expression with clinicopathological parameters, molecular
subtypes of tumors, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for
breast carcinoma patients were evaluated in this study. We immunohistochemically 
stained GATA3, CK5/6, EGFR, CK14 and vimentin on tissue microarray blocks of 457 
invasive breast carcinomas. Tumors are sub-classified as luminal A, luminal B,
HER2 expressing, basal-like and null type according to their hormonal status with
cerbB2, CK 5/6 and EGFR expressions. Follow-up data for 254 cases were obtained. 
215/457 (47%) tumors were GATA3 positive. GATA3 expression was inversely
correlated with mitotic count (p<0.0001), nuclear grade (p=0.001), histological
grade (p=0.001), tumor necrosis (p=0.001), stromal lymphocytic response (p<0.01),
nipple invasion (p=0.01), metastasis (p=0.03), vimentin (p=0.0003), EGFR
(p=0.015) and CK14 (p=0.001) expressions; and directly associated with ER
(p<0.0001) and progesterone receptor (PR) (p<0.0001) expressions. Luminal A
carcinomas had the highest frequency for GATA-3 (140/245), however basal-like
carcinomas had the lowest (1/42) (p<0.0001). None of the medullary and
metaplastic carcinomas expressed GATA3. GATA3 was associated with good DFS and OS
(p=0.001 and p=0.0009) and was an independent prognostic factor for OS. GATA3
expression, regardless of the subtype, may have a prognostic significance for
breast carcinomas through its ability to promote the differentiation of luminal
progenitor cells.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to present demographical features of cases 
diagnosed with malignant tumor associated with ovarian mature teratoma and to
analyze histopathological features and clinical follow up of these tumors.
STUDY DESIGN: Single-institution retrospective charts were reviewed to identify
all cases of ovarian mature teratoma diagnosed from 1998 to 2015.
Clinicopathological parameters that were analyzed include age, tumor size, tumor 
stage, histological type, laterality, IOC diagnosis and whether or not patient
has received adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS: A total of 218 ovarian mature teratoma cases were identified during the 
study period. Of the 218 ovarian mature teratoma specimens, eight (3.7%)
exhibited malignant tumors. The average age for cases of malignancy associated
with ovarian mature teratoma was 44.6 years. The average size of tumors was
10.36cm. On final pathology, histological types of tumors were as follows: two
cases each of squamous cell carcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma; one case
each of mucinous adenocarcinoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma
and oligodendroglioma. Only one patient with Stage IIB tumor died of disease. One
patient was alive with metastatic disease two months after initial diagnosis.
Mean and median follow-up times were 64.1 and 49 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An ovarian mass that has characteristics of a teratoma in a
postmenopausal patient should alert for malignancy -regardless of tumor size. IOC
is a valuable tool for the detection of malignancy and should be requested to
determine the modality of surgical approach.

Trichoblastic carcinoma (TC) is a rare type of malignancy which is derived from
the hair follicles. In this paper, we report a case with TC on the scalp
characterized with rippled pattern. There have been reports of rippled pattern in
trichoblastomas, sebaceomas, and basal cell carcinomas. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report a rippled pattern
in TCs.

Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Perineural invasion (PNI) is correlated with adverse survival in
several malignancies, but its significance cervical cancer remains to be clearly 
defined. The objective of this study was to determine the association between PNI
status and clinical outcomes in clinically localized surgically treated cervical 
cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed clinical records and pathology slides of 111
patients with cervical cancer treated with surgery at a single academic center.
PNI was evaluated for presence, number of foci per slide, involved largest nerve 
size, and topographically (intratumoral vs. extratumoral). Association with these
parameters, clinicopathologic characteristics and survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that PNI in cervical cancer was significantly 
correlated with parametrial invasion, tumor size, resection margin involvement,
lymphovascular invasion, lymph node (LN) metastasis, depth of stromal invasion,
necrosis, and higher stage disease (P < 0.005). Similarly, PNI density and mean
size of the nerve involved were also associated with advanced stage (P < 0.005). 
In the multivariate analysis, PNI was not an independent prognostic factor for
disease-free and overall survival. However, in the advanced stage cases and LN
(+) cases, PNI is significantly associated with lower overall survival (43 vs. 58
months and 36 vs. 60 months, respectively, P < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of PNI is accompanied by high-risk factors for
recurrence. Overall survival rate is significantly reduced in PNI (+) patients.
Although PNI itself is not an independent prognostic factor, PNI has a
significant prognostic impact on overall survival in patients with advanced stage
and/or Node (+) cervical cancer.

AIMS: The objective of this study is to describe shared morphological features of
peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG) and peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF) in 
detail and discuss the possible relationship between them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten intermediate cases with features resembling to both
POF and PGCG were selected and type 3 and 1 collagen immunostainings were
performed for evaluation of the connective tissue maturation. Immunohistochemical
staining percentage (SP) for stromal cells in the slides of POF and PGCG
counterparts of intermediate lesions was scored as 1 when the SP was above 10%, 2
when the SP was above 25%, 3 when the SP was above 50% and 4 when the SP was
above 75%. Staining intensity (SI) of immunuhistochemical staining was graded and
scored as 1 - mild, 2 - moderate, and 3 - severe. An immunoreactivity score was
calculated by multiplying SP and SI.
RESULTS: All intermediate lesions comprised osteoclast type multinucleated giant 
cells and partly mineralized hard tissue component. Parts of intermediate lesions
resembling POF showed higher type 1 collagen immunoreactivity compared to the
PGCG counterparts of intermediate lesions (P < 0.05). PGCG counterparts showed
higher type 3 collagen immunoreactivity compared to the POF counterparts of the
intermediate lesions (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: POF may be a later stage lesion with morphologically more mature
components. A possible transformation may be considered for these two lesions.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze the significance of parakeratosis on an otherwise
negative Papanicalaou (Pap) smear, in the absence of any characteristic human
papilloma virus (HPV) findings.
METHODS: A total of 22,076 Papanicalaou smears that were diagnosed as negative
for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy between 2013 and 2015 were included in 
this study. Samples were separated into two groups, according to the presence of 
parakeratosis. We investigated the association between parakeratosis in the
cytology results and a high-risk HPV status and high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) in the colposcopic biopsy specimens.
RESULTS: A positive HPV result was more frequently identified in cases with
parakeratosis than in cases without parakeratosis (P < 0.001). A histological
diagnosis of HSIL was more frequently observed in HPV-positive cases with a
diagnosis of parakeratosis on cytology than in cases without parakeratosis
(P = 0.8).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a finding of parakeratosis on an
otherwise negative Pap smear supports a follow-up HPV DNA test. Also we should
consider whether the presence of parakeratosis should be included in standard
cytology reports. Additionally parakeratosis trended toward increased frequency
of HSIL in follow-up biopsy specimens. But it did not reach statistical
significance. That is why larger studies are necessary to evaluate the
association of parakeratosis and HSIL in colposcopic biopsy specimens. Diagn.

Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of diabetic nephropathy, which is a
complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this study was to investigate 
the possible role of ethyl pyruvate (EP) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats'
kidney. Four groups (n = 8) of male Wistar albino rats were used as follows:
control group rats received only sodium citrate buffer solution intraperitoneally
(ip). The EP group was given 50 mg/kg EP ip. In the DM group, diabetes was
induced by streptozotocin. The DM + EP group received 50 mg/kg EP ip. All animals
received daily treatment for 14 days, and at the end of the study the kidneys
were removed: the left kidney of the rats was used for malondialdehyde (MDA)
analysis and the right kidney for histological examination. There was normal
appearance of the kidney tissues in the control and the EP-administered groups.
In the DM group, there was evident basement membrane thickening and enlargement
of mesangial matrix; swelling in some tubular epithelial cells was also
noticeable. In the DM+EP administered group, nearly the same appearance as the
control group and relative thickening in the glomerular basal membrane were
observed. The antioxidant effect of ethyl pyruvate improved the renal structures 
in the DM + EP group.

We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of ret finger protein (RFP) along
with conventional immunohistochemical markers in endometrioid and serous
carcinomas of the endometrium. A total of 124 endometrial carcinoma cases (24
grade 1 endometrioid, 60 grade 3 endometrioid, 40 serous) were retrieved from
pathology archives. Tissue microarrays were constructed. The expression of RFP,
WT1, ER, PR, p53 and p16 was examined immunohistochemically. Sensitivity,
specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
statistic for interobserver reproducibility, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U 
test and Fisher's exact tests were performed for statistical analyses. The mean
RFP score was 1.54 in grade 1 endometrioid, 4.31 in grade 3 endometrioid, and
6.31 in serous carcinomas (p < 0.001). Overall, RFP scores were higher both in
serous and grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma (p > 0.05), and significantly lower in 
grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma (p < 0.05). p16 and p53 staining patterns were
able to differentiate between high-grade endometrioid and serous carcinoma (p <
0.001). ER, PR and WT-1 did not reach statistical significance for subtyping. The
 values of the general agreement between the observers were 0.737 and 0.727 for 
endometrioid and serous carcinomas respectively (p < 0.001). Diffuse p53 and p16 
staining provides the most sensitive and specific immunomarkers for
differentiating high-grade endometrioid and serous carcinomas.

The aim of this study was to assess whether misinterpretation of frozen sections 
in endometrial cancer cases is associated with survival and determine the factors
leading to mismatch. One hundred fifty endometrial cancer cases treated in Zeynep
Kamil Maternity and Children's Health Training and Research Hospital between
January 2010 and December 2014 were included in the study. Frozen sections and
final histopathologic reports were screened from a prospectively collected
database and analyzed on whether mismatch between the initial and the final
reports has any impact on disease-free survival. There were 31 patients with
mismatched frozen sections with the final report, whereas in 119 patients, frozen
sections and final reports were consistent. The recurrence-free survival time was
similar between groups (51 vs. 49, P=0.813). Overall survivals were also similar 
between groups (55 vs. 52, P=0.880). Frozen section misinterpretation does not
affect disease-free and overall survival in endometrial cancer cases.

Objective. It was examined whether PTH and 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)
levels, together or separately, are indicators of the risk of stroke. Materials
and Methods. This prospective study was performed at two centers. In the study,
100 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and 100 control individuals in 
the same age range were examined. In addition to neurological examination,
cranial imaging, extensive routine blood chemistry, PTH, and 25(OH)D levels were 
evaluated in all cases. Stroke risk factors were determined. Logistic regression 
was used for statistical analysis. Results. A total of 60 patients and 79 control
individuals were included in the study. Different estimation models were designed
in order to examine the relationship between PTH and 25(OH)D levels with stroke. 
According to modeling results, it was determined that the most effective
predictor for risk of stroke was 25(OH)D levels, followed by hypertension and PTH
levels, respectively. Conclusion. PTH and 25(OH)D levels together can make
important contributions to determination of stroke risk, and further
investigations are needed to understand this relationship more fully.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a frequent neurodegenerative process in old age.
Accumulation and aggregation of the lipid-binding SNARE complex component
α-synuclein (SNCA) underlies this vulnerability and defines stages of disease
progression. Determinants of SNCA levels and mechanisms of SNCA neurotoxicity
have been intensely investigated. In view of the physiological roles of SNCA in
blood to modulate vesicle release, we studied blood samples from a new large
pedigree with SNCA gene duplication (PARK4 mutation) to identify effects of SNCA 
gain of function as potential disease biomarkers. Downregulation of complexin 1
(CPLX1) mRNA was correlated with genotype, but the expression of other
Parkinson's disease genes was not. In global RNA-seq profiling of blood from
presymptomatic PARK4 indviduals, bioinformatics detected significant
upregulations for platelet activation, hemostasis, lipoproteins, endocytosis,
lysosome, cytokine, Toll-like receptor signaling and extracellular pathways. In
PARK4 platelets, stimulus-triggered degranulation was impaired. Strong SPP1, GZMH
and PLTP mRNA upregulations were validated in PARK4. When analysing individuals
with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, the most specific known
prodromal stage of general PD, only blood CPLX1 levels were altered. Validation
experiments confirmed an inverse mutual regulation of SNCA and CPLX1 mRNA levels.
In the 3'-UTR of the CPLX1 gene we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism
that is significantly associated with PD risk. In summary, our data define CPLX1 
as a PD risk factor and provide functional insights into the role and regulation 
of blood SNCA levels. The new blood biomarkers of PARK4 in this Turkish family
might become useful for PD prediction.

Professional medical conferences over the past five years have seen an enormous
increase in the use of Twitter in real-time, also known as "live-tweeting". At
the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) 2015 annual meeting, 
24 attendees (the authors) volunteered to participate in a live-tweet group, the 
#InSituPathologists. This group, along with other attendees, kept the world
updated via Twitter about the happenings at the annual meeting. There were 6,524 
#USCAP2015 tweets made by 662 individual Twitter users; these generated 5,869,323
unique impressions (potential tweet-views) over a 13-day time span encompassing
the dates of the annual meeting. Herein we document the successful implementation
of the first official USCAP annual meeting live-tweet group, including the
pros/cons of live-tweeting and other experiences of the original
#InSituPathologists group members. No prior peer-reviewed publications to our
knowledge have described in depth the use of an organized group to "live-tweet" a
pathology meeting. We believe our group to be the first of its kind in the field 
of pathology.

Steatohepatitis-like Changes in Focal Nodular Hyperplasia, A Finding to
Distinguish From Steatohepatitic Variant of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

of Washington, Seattle, WA §Department of Pathology, University of California,
San Francisco, CA.

Steatohepatitis-like change has not been described in focal nodular hyperplasia
(FNH). Steatohepatitis-like change in FNH may show overlapping features with
steatohepatitic variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This problem can be
compounded if seen in FNH with widened cell plates or hepatocyte rosettes, other 
features that can also be seen in HCC. This study examined steatotic FNHs for the
frequency of steatohepatitis-like change, especially in the setting of FNH with
rosettes and/or widened cell plates. Thirty-three resection specimens of
steatotic FNH from 3 institutions were evaluated for degree of steatosis,
background liver steatosis, ductular reaction, and lymphocytic infiltrate, as
well as presence of thick fibrous bands, thick-walled vessels, ballooned
hepatocytes, Mallory-Denk bodies, dilated sinusoids, hepatocyte rosettes, and
thick hepatic plates. Steatosis was distributed along fibrous septa as well as
diffusely throughout the FNH. Steatohepatitis-like changes were focally present
in 54% (18 cases). Thick plates>3 cells were focally found in 14 cases (42%);
rosettes were common (70%). All cases showed at least 2 of the histologic
features highly suggestive for the diagnosis of FNH such as thick bands of
fibrosis, thick-walled vessels and/or ductular reaction and the typical map-like 
pattern of glutamine synthetase immunostaining. More than half of fatty FNH
examined for this study had features of at least focal steatohepatitis-like
changes. This finding should not be confused with steatohepatitic variant of HCC.
Common typical features of FNH including thick-walled vessels, ductular reaction 
and thick fibrous bands are helpful for discrimination of FNH from HCC.

Manner of Death Determination in Fire Fatalities: 5-Year Autopsy Data of Istanbul
City.

Esen Melez İ(1), Arslan MN, Melez DO, Gürler AS, Büyük Y.

Author information: 
(1)From the *Department of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem
Vakif University, Istanbul; and †The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic
Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.

Death resulting from burns is an important social problem and a frequent
accident. However, because approximately 10% of cases are estimated to result
from a fire that was deliberately started, all fire-related deaths should be
treated as suspicious, and the cause of a fire should be investigated. For the
bodies recovered from the scene of a fire, the manner of death could also be
suicide or homicide. The objective of this study was to contribute to the
clarification of controversial data present in the literature on the manner of
death determination of fire-related deaths, through evaluation of autopsy
findings of bodies recovered from fires. We reviewed 20,135 autopsies performed
in a 5-year period, in Istanbul, as the whole autopsy data of the city and found 
133 fire-related deaths. The death scene investigation reports and other judicial
documents, autopsy findings, and toxicological analysis results were evaluated to
determine the parameters of age, sex, level of the burn, vital signs [red flare; 
soot in the lower respiratory tract, esophagus, and/or stomach; and screening of 
carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels in the blood], toxicological substances, presence
of accelerants, cause of death, and manner of death. The manner of death was
determined to be an accident in 98 (73.7%) and homicide in 12 (9%) cases, whereas
there was no suicide. In addition, it could not be determined in 23 (17.2%)
cases. In accidental deaths, the most frequent cause of death was COHb poisoning 
with statistically significant blood COHb levels greater than 10%. Further, the
presence of soot in the lower respiratory tract, esophagus, and/or stomach and
the existence of at least 1 or 2 vital signs together were found to be valid
deterministic criteria with statistical significance in terms of identifying the 
manner of death.

BACKGROUND: All malignant tumors may spread throughout the pleural, peritoneal,
and pericardial cavities. The presence of tumor cells in serosal fluid is a poor 
prognostic indicator. It may be difficult to differentiate nuclear atypia of
mesothelial cells due to injury of serosal surfaces from mesothelioma or
malignant epithelial tumor cells. Epithelial and mesothelial immunohistochemical 
markers can be used in such conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
expression of two immunohistochemical markers (MOC-31 and EZH2) in serosal
effusions.
METHODS: The study included a total of 142 patients diagnosed with benign or
malignant cytology between January 2012 and April 2014. MOC-31 and EZH2 were
applied to the cell blocks of 53 patients with benign cytology and 89 patients
with malignant cytology determined based on the clinical, radiological data,
histopathology diagnosis, and clinical follow-up in the absence of any surgical
material of the patient in the hospital archive system.
RESULTS: None of the benign cases showed MOC-31 and EZH2 expression, although
these markers were positive in 96 and 93% respectively of the malignant cases.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it could be considered cost-effective to use a double 
immunohistochemical antibody kit for these two markers, MOC-31 membranous and
EZH2 nuclear staining, in the diagnosis of malignant effusions. Diagn.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul,
Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the reliability of using an
interactive automated screening system (IAS) to determine the presence of
endocervical and/or metaplastic cells (transformation zone material; TZM) in
liquid-based cytology (LBC) Papanicolaou (Pap) smear slides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of LBC Pap smears was manually screened to
determine the presence or absence of TZM. The results were compared to those
obtained through IAS.
RESULTS: ThinPrep® Imaging System (Imager)-assisted screening indicated that
22.4% of the slides did not contain TZM in cases in which previous manual
screening revealed that 100% of the slides did contain TZM.
CONCLUSION: The reliability of determining TZM through IAS is limited. Manual
screening of the slides appears to be necessary to report the presence of TZM
accurately.

Since Death Calculations.

Postmortem increase in body core temperature is a well-known phenomenon in
forensic practice. Despite this, cases of reliably documented postmortem
hyperthermia are rarely reported in the forensic literature, and it is still not 
clear how frequently postmortem hyperthermia occurs and in which cases we may it 
predict. In routine forensic practice, the standard course of body cooling is
expected, and the prediction of normal body core temperature in the time of death
is used for back-calculating the time of death by Henssge method. The unexpected 
rising in body core temperature may considerably misguide the estimation of time 
since death in the early postmortem period. We present a rare case of nonviolent 
death in the hospital with exactly recorded unusual elevation of body core
temperature after death, although the body temperature shortly before the death
was normal. In the presented case, the "standard" cooling of the body began up to
4 hours after death.

Purpose. The objective is to compare lateralizing ability of three quantitative
MR (qMRI) modalities to depict changes of hippocampal architecture with clinical 
entities in temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods. We evaluated 14 patients with
clinical and EEG proven diagnosis of unilateral TLE and 15 healthy volunteers.
T1-weighted 3D dataset for volumetry, single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy (MRS), and 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed for bilateral hippocampi of all
subjects. Results. Individual volumetric measurements provided accurate
lateralization in 85% of the patients, spectroscopy in 57%, and DTI in 57%.
Higher lateralization ratios were acquired combining volumetry-spectroscopy
(85%), spectroscopy-DTI (85%), and volumetry-DTI (100%). Significantly decreased 
NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratios (p = 0.002) and increased FA (p = 0.001) values were obtained
in ipsilateral to epileptogenic hippocampus. Duration of epilepsy and FA values
showed a significant negative correlation (p = 0.016, r = -0.847). The history of
febrile convulsion associated with ipsilateral increased ADC values (p = 0.015, r
= 0.851) and reduced NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratios (p = 0.047, r = -761). Conclusion.
Volumetry, MRS, and DTI studies provide complementary information of hippocampal 
pathology. For lateralization of epileptogenic focus and preoperative
examination, volumetry-DTI combination may be indicative of diagnostic accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) of the pancreas present a management
conundrum. The majority are benign but all are resected due to their malignant
potential. Recent studies have recommended nonsurgical management. In the current
study, the authors analyzed the preoperative imaging, cytology, and cyst fluid
characteristics of 136 histologically confirmed MCNs to assess predictors of a
high-risk (HR) cyst for surgical triage.
METHODS: MCNs resected at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1990 and
2014 formed the study cohort. Patient demographics, cyst size, and mural nodules 
(MNs) by endoscopic ultrasound, cytology, and cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen
and amylase levels were correlated with histological grade. A HR cyst was defined
as high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma on histology. Performance
characteristics were assessed for each parameter, with a cyst size ≥3 cm or a MN 
on imaging and malignant cytology considered to be "true-positive" results for
predicting malignancy.
RESULTS: Only 15 of the 136 cysts had HR histology (11%). On average, patients
with HR cysts were older than those with low-risk cysts (55 years vs 49 years,
respectively). High-grade cytology was the most accurate predictor of malignancy 
(95%) followed by MN and cyst size together (88%) and MN alone (83%). The average
carcinoembryonic antigen level (in ng/mL) increased with the grade of dysplasia
but the ranges overlapped between low risk and HR cysts.
CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest series
to date analyzing the cytological features of histologically confirmed MCN.
Cytology is insensitive but very specific for detecting a HR MCN and outperformed
imaging for the detection of HR MCN. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle
aspiration and cytology should be performed on any clinically suspected MCN that 
is being considered for conservative management. Cancer Cytopathol

Head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMuM), which occurs mostly in the sinonasal and 
oral cavity, constitutes less than 1% of all malignant melanomas. Treatment
options fail to improve the prognosis of this aggressive tumour that has low
overall survival rates. Thus, development of new targeted therapies is essential.
Unfortunately, limited data exist regarding their molecular profile. BRAF, NRAS, 
KIT, TERT and GNAQ/GNA11 oncogene mutations were investigated in 42 HNMuMs (28
sinonasal, 13 oral, 1 nasopharyngeal). Mutation rates were as follows: BRAF
(4.8%), NRAS (4.8%), KIT (9.5%), TERT (7.5%), GNAQ/GNA11 (0%). Among 11 cases
that harboured mutations (26%), 10 (91%) were located in sinonasal and one (9%)
in the oral cavity. The literature was reviewed with comparison of frequencies
based on the gathered data. NRAS and TERT promoter mutation rates were
significantly higher in sinonasal than in oral location (p<0.05). Our results
indicated that BRAF, NRAS, KIT, TERT and GNAQ/GNA11 gene mutations occur at low
frequencies in HNMuMs, and subgroups (oral versus sinonasal) differ in their
molecular profile. Low rates of aforementioned mutations and activation of
oncogenes by pathways other than sun exposure support the distinctive nature of
HNMuMs with regard to their cutaneous counterparts.

Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most fatal types of cancer in both women
and men, and, unfortunately, patients are often diagnosed at an advanced stage.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and
recurrence, as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. Therefore,
different treatment alternatives are needed to facilitate the elimination of
CSCs. One such approach is immunotherapy; however, tumor cells can evade immune
cells by alteration of the expression patterns of human leukocyte antigens (HLA).
In this study, we immunohistochemically investigated the expression patterns of
CSC-specific markers CD44, CD133, Nanog, and Oct3/4, and immunosuppressive
molecules HLA-G and -E in advanced CRC tumor tissues and noncancerous colon
biopsies. We found significantly increased CD44, Nanog, Oct3/4, HLA-G, and HLA-E 
expression in the CRC tumor tissues compared with the noncancerous colon
biopsies. These findings suggest that some tumor cells may be CSC-like and that
the increased expression of HLA-G and HLA-E may be considered as an
immune-evasive adaptation. Therefore, the nonclassical major histocompatibility
complex class Ib antigens HLA-G and HLA-E may be potential targets in the
elimination of CRC-CSCs. However, more detailed studies are required to support
our findings.

The histogenesis of nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes lesion is controversial,
and various hypotheses have been used to explain their origin. One of them is the
transport of cells from cutaneous nevi or lesions to lymph nodes, called
mechanical transport theory. We investigated in our cases of benign nevi to
obtain evidence to substantiate this theory. A total of 369 benign cutaneous nevi
were prospectively evaluated in excisional biopsy samples. Immunohistochemical
stainings for CD31 and podoplanin (D2-40) were performed in the cases with
intralymphatic nevus cell aggregate (ILNA), suspected for ILNA, and/or
intralymphatic nevus cell protrusion. A total of 13 ILNAs were found in 10
patients. Six ILNA were verified with their histology as well as
immunohistochemically with D2-40 and CD31. Protrusions of nevus cells inside the 
lymphatics (intralymphatic nevus cell protrusion) were seen in all cases of ILNA 
and also in 27 nevi where an ILNA was not observed. In most nevi, the
perilymphatic orientation of nevus cells and their affinity to the lymphatics
were observed. We suggested that ILNAs can be dislodged with local minor trauma
and be carried inside the lymphatic vessel to the draining lymph node. Besides,
whether ILNA or not, nevus cells could also move toward lymphatic spaces with
mechanical effects due to their affinity to lymphatics and their localizations
that are very close to the endothelium. Our findings might support the mechanical
transport theory.

Autophagy is an essential cellular pathway that sequesters various cytoplasmic
components, including accumulated proteins, damaged organelles or invading
microorganisms and delivers them to lysosomes for degradation. The function of
autophagy has been reported in various tissues and systems, including its role in
the regulation of cellular immunity. Autophagy plays a fundamental role at
various stages of T cell maturation. It regulates the thymocyte selection and the
generation of T cell repertoire by presenting intracellular antigens to MHC class
molecules. Autophagy is crucial for metabolic regulation of T cells, and
therefore supports cell survival and homeostasis, particularly in activated
mature T cells. Furthermore, deletion of specific autophagy-related genes induces
several immunological alterations including differentiation of activated T cells 
into regulatory, memory or natural killer T cells. In this review, we emphasize
the impact of autophagy on T cell development, activation and differentiation,
which is pivotal for the adaptive immune system.

Follicular hybrid cysts including two or more components of the epithelial skin
adnexa are very rare. The epithelial lining of hybrid cysts varies, and either
contains epidermis, and trichilemmal squamous epithelium, or other epithelia of
the skin adnexa. Hybrid cysts may also be associated with neoplasia, such as in
situ carcinoma, Bowen's disease and squamous cell carcinoma. A 37-year-old female
was complaining of a cyst on her scalp. The unilocular cystic lesion was lined
with markedly atypical squamous cells with trichilemmal differentiation. Marked
nuclear and cytological atypia, pleomorphism, numerous mitotic figures and
atypical mitosis was detected in the squamous epithelium. The epithelium of the
cyst was also composed of ductal structures lined with cuboidal epithelium.
Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) in both
squamous and glandular epithelium. Luminal staining was shown by carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA), although gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) was
negative in the glandular epithelium. In addition, p16 tumor suppressor gene was 
strongly positive in both the squamous and glandular epithelium. Overall, the
unique cystic lesion reported contained pilar squamous epithelium with in situ
carcinoma and eccrine ductal structures, which was interpreted as a hybrid cyst
composed of in situ trichilemmal carcinoma and a ductal eccrine component.

Rearrangements of the ROS1 gene occur in 1-2 % of non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs). Crizotinib, a highly effective inhibitor of ROS1 kinase activity, is
now FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC.
Consequently, focus on ROS1 testing is growing. Most laboratories currently rely 
on fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assays using a dual-colour
break-apart probe to detect ROS1 rearrangements. Given the rarity of these
rearrangements in NSCLC, detection of elevated ROS1 protein levels by
immunohistochemistry may provide cost-effective screening prior to confirmatory
FISH testing. Non-in situ testing approaches also hold potential as stand-alone
methods or complementary tests, including multiplex real-time PCR assays and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms which include commercial test kits
covering a range of fusion genes. In order to ensure high-quality biomarker
testing, appropriate tissue handling, adequate control materials and
participation in external quality assessment programmes are essential,
irrespective of the testing technique employed. ROS1 testing is often only
considered after negative tests for EGFR mutation and ALK gene rearrangement,
based on the assumption that these oncogenic driver events tend to be exclusive. 
However, as the use of ROS1 inhibitors becomes routine, accurate and timely
detection of ROS1 gene rearrangements will be critical for the optimal treatment 
of patients with NSCLC. As NGS techniques are introduced into routine diagnostic 
practice, ROS1 fusion gene testing will be provided as part of the initial
testing package.

Distal common bile duct carcinoma is a poorly characterized entity for reasons
such as variable terminology and difficulty in determining site of origin of
intrapancreatic lesions. We compared clinicopathologic features of
pancreatobiliary-type adenocarcinomas within the pancreas, but arising from the
distal common bile duct, with those of pancreatic and ampullary origin. Upon
careful review of 1017 pancreatoduodenectomy specimens with primary
adenocarcinoma, 52 (5%) qualified as intrapancreatic distal common bile duct
carcinoma. Five associated with an intraductal papillary neoplasm were excluded; 
the remaining 47 were compared to 109 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and 133
ampullary carcinomas. Distal common bile duct carcinoma patients had a younger
median age (58 years) than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (65 years)
and ampullary carcinoma patients (68 years). Distal common bile duct carcinoma
was intermediate between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma
with regard to tumor size and rates of node metastases and margin positivity.
Median survival was better than for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (P=0.0010)
but worse than for ampullary carcinoma (P=0.0006). Distal common bile duct
carcinoma often formed an even band around the common bile duct and commonly
showed intraglandular neutrophil-rich debris and a small tubular pattern. Poor
prognostic indicators included node metastasis (P=0.0010), lymphovascular
invasion (P=0.0299), and margin positivity (P=0.0069). Categorizing the tumors
based on size also had prognostic relevance (P=0.0096), unlike categorization
based on anatomic structures invaded. Primary distal common bile duct carcinoma
is seen in younger patients than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or ampullary
carcinoma. Its prognosis is significantly better than pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma and worse than ampullary carcinoma, at least partly because of
differences in clinical presentation. Use of size-based criteria for staging
appears to improve its prognostic relevance. Invasive pancreatobiliary-type
distal common bile duct carcinomas are uncommon in the West and have substantial 
clinicopathologic differences from carcinomas arising from the pancreas and
ampulla.

Differentiation between benign and malignant lesions of the hepatic biliary tree 
may pose a diagnostic problem because well-differentiated intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma may mimic biliary hamartoma, bile duct adenoma, or parenchymal
extinction. We evaluated Ki-67 proliferative index and p53 status by
immunohistochemical staining to aid in exclusion of cholangiocarcinoma. Fourteen 
biliary hamartomas, 21 bile duct adenomas, and 11 livers with parenchymal
extinction were compared with 26 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (16
well-differentiated and 10 moderately or poorly differentiated tumors). We found 
an increased proliferative index in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas compared
with benign biliary lesions (average 23.0% in cholangiocarcinoma versus 1.4% in
all benign biliary lesions, n = 26 versus n = 46, P < .001). No difference in
average proliferative index was observed between well-differentiated and
moderately/poorly differentiated cholangiocarcinomas (average 22.7% versus 23.3%,
n = 16 versus n = 10, P = .92). Average proliferation indices of benign biliary
lesions were uniformly low (biliary hamartoma, 1.2%; bile duct adenoma, 2%;
parenchymal extinction, 0.5%). Most cholangiocarcinomas (23/26; 88.5%), but none 
of the benign lesions (0/46; 0%), had proliferative indices greater than 10%.
Strong nuclear p53 immunohistochemical staining was only seen in
cholangiocarcinomas (9/26; 34.6%) and not in benign biliary lesions (0/46; 0%),
although many of the benign lesions showed weak to moderate staining.
Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 facilitates distinction between benign and
malignant lesions of the intrahepatic biliary tree, whereas p53
immunohistochemical staining is less helpful.

Pleural Malignant Mesothelioma (MM) is a fatal disease that has been associated
with asbestos exposure. Differential diagnosis between the pleural infiltration
of pulmonary carcinomas and MM is rather difficult particularly for epitheloid
type mesothelioma.We aimed to investigate the utility of CD90, a cancer stem cell
marker, in the differential diagnosis of MM and lung carcinoma, its prognostic
significance and compare its value with that of Calretinin. Ninety pathology
specimens including MM (n:30), pulmonary adenocarcinoma (n:30) and pulmonary
squamous cell carcinoma (n:30) were used in this study. Immunohistochemical
comparision of CD 90 and Calretinin was made in all groups. Calretinin was
positive in 20 cases with MM (64.5 %), and was negative in 10 (32.3 %). CD 90 was
positive in 25 of these cases (80 %) and negative in 5 (16 %). On the other hand 
pulmonary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas showed positivity with
CD90, 63,6 % and 73 %, respectively. We think that CD 90 has no place in the
differential diagnosis between mesothelioma and pulmonary carcinoma because of
the low specificity in spite of the high sensitivity.

BACKGROUND: We intended to study whether there is a meaningful difference in
microscopic examination between dividing a biopsy section into two equal parts
before tissue processing (first method) or after (second method).
METHODS: A total of 400 cases were included in the study. Punch biopsies (PB)
were cut into two pieces using the first method in 200 cases and just before
paraffin embedding in another 200 cases using the second method. We
microscopically evaluated the epidermal mesh view, the presence of a cross-cut
hair follicle and bow shape because of epidermal angling, the presence of two
pieces on the slide and if there was a difference of >2 mm between the parts, and
the number of new sections and new slides.
RESULTS: Cross-cut hair follicle (p = 0.018), epidermal mesh view (p = 0.036),
difference of >2 mm between the parts (p = 0.008), the number of new sections (p 
< 0.001) and new slides (p < 0.001) were considerably higher when the first
method was used compared with the second method. The presence of two pieces was
less (p < 0.001) when using the first method.
CONCLUSIONS: We noted a meaningful difference in the quality of microscopic
evaluation between the first and second methods. Better sections were obtained
with the second method. In addition, the decrease in the number of new slides
will reduce workload, archival work and cost.

Lower respiratory infections are commonly due to viruses and are the third
largest cause of death. Respiratory tract viruses have a tendency to target the
specific regions in the lung and can harm the host via direct effect of the virus
and the host's inflammatory response. In this study, relationships between
morphologic changes in the lung and the viral agent type isolated in the lung by 
the polymerase chain reaction technique were investigated. This study was
performed retrospectively at 113 autopsy cases in the Council of Forensic
Medicine in Istanbul. Slides from the lung tissues diagnosed as interstitial
pneumonia and detected viral agent in polymerase chain reaction were evaluated
and reviewed under light microscope by 2 pathologists simultaneously according to
predetermined bronchiolar, alveolar, and interstitial findings. Alveolar findings
were detected in 108 cases (95.6%), whereas interstitial and bronchiolar findings
were detected in 91 (80.5%) and 38 (33.6%) cases, respectively. Intra-alveolar
edema was the most common alveolar finding. Some findings such as multinucleated 
syncytial cells and smudge cells can aid the search for etiologic agent.
Interstitial inflammation was the most common histopathologic finding in the lung
in viral infections and the most prominent clue to viral infections in the lung
histopathologically without discrimination of viral agent type.

Pancreatic cysts >1 cm lined by nonpapillary mucinous epithelium without
ovarian-type stroma pose diagnostic challenges. The term "simple mucinous cyst"
was recently proposed for this entity. Our goal was to determine the
clinicopathologic characteristics of these cysts, as they have not been
previously described. Of the 39 patients with pancreatic resections included in
this study, the mean age was 65 years and the female-to-male ratio was 4:1. The
characteristics of the cysts are as follows: 82% had elevated cyst fluid
carcinoembryonic antigen levels, 67% were unilocular, 69% occurred in the
body/tail, 92% did not communicate with pancreatic ducts, the mean size was 2.4
cm (range, 1.0 to 5.5 cm), the cyst contents tended to be serous (48%) or viscous
(28%), all had a smooth lining (only 1 had focal excrescences) composed of bland 
columnar mucinous epithelium (low-grade dysplasia) in 92% with focal high-grade
dysplasia in 8%, and 65% had degenerative changes (granulation-like tissue,
hemorrhage, and myxoid stroma). The cyst lining was CK7+ and 97% had a MUC5AC+
and/or MUC6+ gastric phenotype; overt intestinal features were absent. In total, 
55% of cysts tested (fluid and/or resections) harbored KRAS mutations. The term
"simple mucinous cyst" is useful to apply to >1 cm mucinous cysts that do not
have characteristic features of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or
mucinous cystic neoplasms. KRAS mutations can be detected in these typically
bland cysts, and in rare instances, focal high-grade dysplasia may be present.
Hence, these cysts should be viewed as neoplastic and treated similarly to other 
mucinous pancreatic cysts.

The role of cancer stem cells in the initiation and progression of cancer has
become a well-studied area of emerging research, and stem cells with different
surface markers have been identified in various types of cancer. CD24 is a
membrane protein that acts as the ligand for P-selectin and has been defined as a
stem cell marker of colonic cancer. The immunohistochemical expression of CD24 is
associated with worse patient outcomes in small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular 
carcinoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer. In this study, we used
immunohistochemistry to determine CD24 expression in clear cell, papillary and
chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and investigated its relationship with other
clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. A total of 108 cases of clear cell,
12 papillary and 13 choromophobe renal cell carcinoma were examined.
Clinicopathological features including age, gender, vascular invasion, tumor
necrosis, and T stage were recorded. Clinical stage and overall survival and
disease-free survival times were recorded. The immunohistochemical expression of 
CD24 was classified as low or high based on the percentage and intensity of
positive staining. CD24 expression was associated with both tumor grade and
recurrence rates. The survival analysis revealed that patients with high CD24
expression exhibited significantly lower overall and disease-free survival.
Increased expression of CD24 is related to the prognosis of clear cell renal cell
carcinoma. This is the first study identifying a strong association between CD24 
expression levels and survival. Thus, CD24 expression may aid in predicting
prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) appear mainly
in the oral air of patients with halitosis. It seems that VSCs are directly
involved in the pathogenesis of gingival diseases. In previous studies,
short-term (7 hours-4 days), high concentrations (5-400 ppm) of H2S applications 
on periodontal tissues have been evaluated in a culture medium. The aim of the
present study was to investigate the potential effects of lower (equivalent to
halitosis) concentrations of H2S on rat gingival tissue for longer-term
inhalation. The threshold level of pathologic halitosis perceived by humans at
250 ppb of H2S was converted to rat equivalent concentration (4.15 ppm). Rats in 
the experimental (H2S) group (n=8) were exposed to H2S continuously but not the
control rats (n=8). After 50 days, the gingival sulcular tissue samples of each
rat were taken and examined using transmission electron microscope.
Ultrastructural changes in the sulcular epithelia of the rat gingiva showed
deformation of celullar shape, vacuolization, and disintegrity of intercelullar
connection by loss of desmosomes and collagen fibrils. No basal membrane damage
was observed. Inhalation of low levels of H2S (equivalent of halitosis) in the
oral environment causes ultrastructural celullar damages in rat sulcular mucosa. 
These results suggest that halitosis may be the potential reason for periodontal 
destruction in humans.

Metastatic bladder tumors constitute <5% of all bladder tumors and metastatic
malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder is very rare. We present a case report 
of a metastatic malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder. A 70-year-old woman
without any apparent significant clinical history was admitted to the Department 
of Urology for gross hematuria. Microscopic findings of the transurethral
resection specimen revealed fascicles, sheets, and diffuse areas composed of oval
and fusiform cells with focal pigmentation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed
that the tumor cells were positive for human melanoma black-45, Melan-A, and
S100, and negative for pancytokeratin. Subsequently, we contacted the patient and
learned that she was admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology for painless and
progressive visual field loss 15 years ago. She had been diagnosed with a primary
ocular (uveal) melanoma. A detailed patient history coupled with histological and
immunohistochemical findings were necessary to make the final diagnosis of
metastatic melanoma.

Human and bovine group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates were serotyped and amounts 
of released N-acetylneuraminic acid from N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose by
extracellular neuraminidase were colorimetrically assessed. According to
serotyping by co-agglutination method, 30 of bovine GBS and 43 of human GBS could
be serotyped (ST) by monospecific antisera coated with protein A. The remaining
GBS strains were designated as nontypeable (NT). The released N-acetylneuraminic 
acid was determined in 90.9% of bovine GBS and 47.1% of human GBS isolates. The
differences between the total bovine and human GBS isolates were statistically
significant (p < 0.001). In comparison with detected N-acetylneuraminic acid
level in bovine and human groups, significant decrease was observed in the bovine
NT group according to increased human NT (p < 0.01) and bovine ST groups (p <
0.01). However, N-acetylneuraminic acid level in bovine ST and bovine total
groups significantly (p < 0.001) increased with respect to the human ST group and
human total group. Neuraminidase activity was detected more frequently in bovine 
GBS isolates. Considerable differentiations were observed between typeable and
nontypeable isolates.

Objectives. In our study we aimed to determine VDR gene polymorphisms in patients
with Behçet's disease (BD) and neuro-Behçet's disease (NBD) in Turkish
population. Methods. PBL obtained from 37 patients with BD, 21 patients with NB, 
and 30 healthy controls were investigated. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole
blood using the QIAamp Blood Kit. VDR ApaI (rs7975232), VDR FokI (rs2228570), and
VDR TaqI (rs731236) genotyping was performed by real-time polymerase chain
reaction with SimpleProbe melting-curve analysis. Results. The allelic and
genotype distributions of FokI and TaqI polymorphisms were not different among
Behçet's disease, neuro-Behçet's disease, and control subjects in Turkish
population (p > 0.05). Only the frequency of ApaI A allele in control is higher
than that in BD (60% versus 38.5%), and the p value is 0.014, but the power is
not enough to conclude that ApaI A allele is protective in BD in our study. Taken
together, we found no significant differences between the BD, NBD, and control
groups regarding the distribution of ApaI, TaqI, and FokI genotype and alleles
frequencies. Conclusions. Future studies with larger patients' numbers may show
differences between VDR polymorphisms and Behçet's disease.

BACKGROUND: The role of leptin in primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) pathogenesis is
unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of leptin and
leptin receptor (LEPR) in minor salivary glands in patients with SS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of leptin and LEPR in minor salivary gland 
specimens obtained from patients with primary SS (n=50) and control subjects
(n=50) were examined using immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: Acinar cells, epithelial cells and adipocytes in salivary glands can
express leptin and LEPR. It was observed that there was intense staining in the
focal lymphocytic infiltration areas in SS patients. The intensity of leptin and 
LEPR staining under microscopy (400×) were graded semiquantitatively as negative,
mild, moderate or strongly positive, and scored as 1, 2 or 3, respectively. The
expression levels of leptin and LEPR in patients with primary SS were not higher 
than in controls. There was no significant difference in degrees of leptin and
LEPR staining, staining intensity, and immunoreactive scores between groups. The 
expression of leptin and LEPR were not correlated with autoantibodies such as RF,
ANA, anti-Ro, and/or anti-La positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that leptin and its receptors do not play an
important role in primary SS pathophysiology.

The prevalence of autoantibody in the patients with chronic hepatitis C
infection, and the relationship between the autoantibodies and HCV genotypes were
investigated in this study. One hundred and eight anti-HCV positive and 86
anti-HCV negative patients were included in the study. Anti-HCV were studied by
enzyme immunassay (EIA). HCV RNA was determined by real time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and HCV genotypes were determined by a reverse-line blot
hybridization. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibodies
(ASMA), Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), liver kidney microsomal antibodies
(LKM) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Among patients, 13
(12.03%) of 108 were positive for at least one autoantibody. The positivity was
not observed in control group. The most prevalent autoantibody in anti-HCV
positive group was ANA. ANA was positive in six HCV patients with genotype 1. In 
HCV patients with genotype 1, the frequencies of ANA, ASMA, AMA and LKM1 were
six, two, three and one, respectively. In HCV patients with genotype 2, ANA was
positive one patient and ASMA, AMA and LKM1 were not detected in HCV patients
with genotype 2. In conclusion, the autoantibodies in patients with chronic
hepatitis C in the study were low as compared to those reported in previous
studies.

BACKGROUND: A fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the most valuable
diagnostic procedure for pre-operative discrimination of benign and malignant
nodules. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology provides
standardised reporting and cytomorphological criteria in aspiration smears. The
aim of the present study was to determine malignancy rates in nodules with
different cytology results and evaluate the diagnostic value of Bethesda for
variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 2534 cases with 5784 thyroid
nodules, who underwent FNAB followed by surgery, were included in this study.
FNAB was performed with ultrasonography guidance. Cytological diagnoses were
classified as: non-diagnostic (ND), benign, atypia of undetermined
significance/follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS),
follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN), suspicious for
malignancy (SUS) and malignant. Histopathological diagnoses were classified into 
four groups: benign, PTC, follicular thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid
cancer (including medullary thyroid cancer, undifferentiated thyroid cancer and
thyroid tumours of uncertain malignant potential). Cases with PTC were further
divided into four categories: conventional variant, follicular variant,
aggressive variants (tall cell, diffuse sclerosing and columnar variant) and
other variants (oncocytic, solid/trabecular and warthin-like variants). FNAB
results were compared with histopathological results.
RESULTS: Malignancy rates were 6.3%, 3.2%, 20.7%, 33.3%, 74.2% and 95.6% in the
nodules with ND, benign, AUS/FLUS, FN/SFN, SUS and malignant cytology results,
respectively. Pre-operative cytology was malignant or SUS in 56.6% of
conventional, 24.3% of follicular, 92% of aggressive and 41.7% of other variants 
of histopathologically confirmed PTC. The difference between the groups was
significant (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The Bethesda classification is a reliable indicator of malignancy in 
nodules with different cytology results and seems to be very effective in
predicting the malignancy for the nodules diagnosed with aggressive variant PTC
on the final histological examination.

The placenta, which is a regulator organ for many metabolic activities between
mother and fetus, is critical in influencing the outcome of pregnancy. Therefore,
fetal growth is directly related to the placental development. Placental
development depends on the coordinated action of trophoblast proliferation,
differentiation and invasion. Studies on cell cycle related proteins that control
these events are limited. Abnormal placental development is linked to various
pregnancy pathologies such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction,
diabetes mellitus and gestational trophoblastic diseases. The cell cycle
mechanism of human placenta should be well understood for a healthy pregnancy
outcome. Moreover, how cell cycle related proteins that control placental
development are affected in pregnancy pathologies is not fully understood yet.
Therefore, the aim of this review is to address the currently available knowledge
on cell cycle regulatory proteins involved in human placental development and on 
the expression differences of these proteins in pathological placentas.

One of the regions of involvement of Behçet's disease (BD), a systematic
inflammatory vasculitis with unknown etiology, is the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract. Upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy are frequently used
methods to diagnose the intestinal involvement of BD. The aim of this study was
to investigate the role of fecal calprotectin (FC) in the evaluation of
intestinal involvement in BD. Material and Method. A total of 30 patients who
were diagnosed with BD and had no GI symptoms and 25 individuals in the control
group were included in this study. Results. Levels of FC were statistically
significantly higher in patients with BD compared to the control group (p <
0.001). The correlation analysis performed including FC and markers of disease
activity revealed a positive and statistically significant correlation between FC
level and CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r: 0.255, p < 0.049, and r:
0.404, p < 0.001, resp.). FC levels in patients who were detected to have ulcers 
in the terminal ileum and colon in the colonoscopic examination were
statistically significantly higher compared to the patients with BD without
intestinal involvement (p = 0.01). Conclusion. The measurement of FC levels, in
patients with BD who are asymptomatic for GI involvement, may be helpful to
detect the possible underlying intestinal involvement.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
Human papilloma virus (HPV) has also been detected in NPC cases. In this
retrospective study, we analyze the frequency of EBV and HPV infection in 82
Turkish patients with NPC. A total of 82 were evaluated for EBV and HPV. In situ 
hybridization (ISH) was performed for EBV. HPV-ISH and P16 immunohistochemistry
used to determine the HPV status. Seventy-two of the 82 (87%) NPC patients were
EBV-positive. The highest rate of EBV-positivity was found in undifferentiated
NPC patients, which accounted for 65 of 68 (95.6%) undifferentiated cases. One of
the 82 NPC patients whose tumor was non-keratinizing differentiated, contained
HPV. Our data shows that EBV is closely associated with NPC in Turkey. We found
lower rates of HPV-positivity in NPC patients than in North American populations.
In addition, both EBV and HPV-negativity were more associated with decreased
survival than EBV-positive cases.

The spectrum of mucosal pathology in coeliac disease (CD), initially defined by
Marsh in 1992 has been subjected to several modifications in the following years 
by Oberhuber, then by Corazza and Villanaci, and finally by Ensari. The present
study, aimed to end the ongoing confusion regarding the classification of mucosal
pathology in CD by applying all the classifications proposed so far on a large
series of cases. A total of 270 duodenal biopsies taken from the distal duodenum 
of patients with a diagnosis of CD were included in the study. All biopsies were 
classified according to Marsh, Oberhuber, Corazza Villanaci, and Ensari
classification schemes. For statistical analyses cases were divided into three
groups: Group 1 included type 1 lesions in Marsh, Ensari, and Oberhuber and grade
A in Corazza Villanaci classifications. Group 2 comprised of type 2 lesions in
Marsh and Ensari classifications together with type2, type 3a and 3b lesions in
Oberhuber classification and grade B1 lesions in Corazza Villanaci
classification. Group 3 included type 3 lesions in Marsh and Ensari
classifications, and type 3c lesions in Oberhuber, and grade B2 lesions in
Corazza Villanaci classifications. The kappa value was 1.00 (excellent) for group
1, 0.53 (fair) for group 2 and 0.78 (excellent) for group 3 (p<0.0001). These
results suggest that any of the above classification system would serve similar
purposes in the diagnosis of CD. Therefore, it is advisable that the pathologist 
should use the simplest reliable scheme.

BACKGROUND: Only a small number of studies on computerized cytomorphometry have
been performed for thyroid FNAC. The present study aimed to determine the
usefulness of computerized cytomorphometry methods to further classify thyroid
lesions as benign or malignant and to compare the practicability and value of
using Papanicolaou (Pap) and Giemsa stains in thyroid FNAC by evaluating their
association to various cytologic nuclear parameters.
METHODS: Fifty-eight thyroid lesions diagnosed by FNAC and categorized according 
to the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology were evaluated in
terms of various cytologic nuclear parameters, including nuclear area (NA),
nuclear perimeter (NP), nuclear density (ND), long nuclear diameter (LND), and
short nuclear diameter (SND). The Pap- and Giemsa-stained slides were examined
separately.
RESULTS: In the malignant cases, NA, NP, LND, and SND were higher than in the
benign cases for both the Pap and Giemsa stains. NA, NP, LND, and SND were higher
in Giemsa than Pap for both the benign and malignant groups. Statistically
significant differences were detected between the benign and malignant cases in
the AUS category.
CONCLUSIONS: Computerized cytomorphometry is useful in distinguishing between
benign and malignant lesions in thyroid FNAC. The measurement of cytologic
nuclear parameters in cases suggestive of AUS may be useful for the probable
classification of cases as benign or malignant. Although further studies are
needed, in nuclear morphometric assessment of thyroid FNAC, Giemsa staining may
be more useful and valuable than the Pap stain because of its association with
various cytologic nuclear parameters. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:902-911. © 2016

AIM: Our aim in this study was to investigate the effect of maternal obesity and 
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on cord blood dynamic thiol/disulfide
homeostasis.
METHODS: A prospective case-control study was carried out in 125 pregnant women
(27 GDM, 30 obese, 68 controls). Cord blood samples were collected from all
participants and native thiol-disulfide exchanges were examined with automated
method enabling the measurement of both sides of thiol-disulfide balance.
RESULTS: Disulfide amounts, disulfide/native thiol and disulfide/total thiol
ratios were increased (p < 0.001), while native thiol/total thiol was decreased
in the cord blood of babies born to an obese or diabetic mother (p < 0.001).
Moreover, increased disulfide amounts, disulfide/native thiol,
disulfide/totalthiol ratios and decreased native/total thiol were found to be
significantly associated with adverse outcomes in GDM.
CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that the offsprings born to obese or
diabetic mothers are exposed to increased oxidative stress.

Propolis is a potent antioxidant and a free radical scavenger. The present study 
aimed to investigate protective effects of propolis extract on cadmium-induced
testicular damage, apoptosis, HIF-1α expression and toxicity in rat's testis
tissue. A total of 32 male rats were equally divided into four study groups
namely, control, Cd (1mg/kg/day), Cd+propolis (50mg/kg/day) and propolis. The
rats were decapitated under ketamine anesthesia and their testes tissues were
removed. Serum testosterone, tissue malondialdehyde and HIF-1α levels, HIF-1α
expression, apoptosis and histopathological damage scores were then compared. In 
the Cd group, the diameters of seminiferous tubules, tubular biopsy score of
Johnsen and serum testosterone levels were decreased compared control group, but 
tissue HIF-1α and tissue MDA levels was higher than control group. The
immunoreactivity of HIF-1α and the number of apoptotic cells were increased in Cd
group. Furthermore, the propolis treated group showed an improved histological
appearance in the Cd group. Thus, the results suggest that propolis acts as a
potent protective agent against Cd-induced testicular toxicity in rats.

Histologic classification of ampullary carcinomas as intestinal versus
pancreatobiliary is rapidly becoming a part of management algorithms, with
immunohistochemical classification schemes also being devised using this
classification scheme as their basis. However, data on the reproducibility and
prognostic relevance of this classification system are limited. In this study,
five observers independently evaluated 232 resected ampullary carcinomas with
invasive component >3 mm. Overall interobserver agreement was 'fair' (κ 0.39;
P<0.001) with complete agreement in 23%. Using agreement by 3/5 observers as
'consensus' 40% of cases were classified as 'mixed' pancreatobiliary and
intestinal. When observers were asked to provide a final diagnosis based on the
predominant pattern in cases initially classified as mixed, there was 'moderate' 
agreement (κ 0.44; P<0.0001) with 5/5 agreeing in 35%. Cases classified as
pancreatobiliary by consensus (including those with pure-pancreatobiliary or
mixed-predominantly pancreatobiliary features) had shorter overall (median 41
months) and 5-year survival (38%) than those classified as
pure-intestinal/mixed-predominantly intestinal (80 months and 57%, respectively; 
P=0.026); however, on multivariate analysis this was not independent of
established prognostic parameters. Interestingly, when compared with 476 cases of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, the pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinomas
had better survival (16 versus 41 months, P<0.001), even when matched by size and
node status. In conclusion, presumably because of the various cell types
comprising the region, ampullary carcinomas frequently show mixed phenotypes and 
intratumoral heterogeneity, which should be considered when devising management
protocols. Caution is especially warranted when applying this histologic
classification to biopsies and tissue microarrays. While ampullary carcinomas
with more pancreatobiliary morphology have a worse prognosis than intestinal ones
this does not appear to be an independent prognostic factor. However,
pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinomas have a much better prognosis than
their pancreatic counterparts.

The Relationship Between Skinfold Thickness and Leptin, Ghrelin, Adiponectin, and
Resistin Levels in Infants of Diabetic Mothers.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between skinfold thickness and
serum leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and resistin levels in infants of diabetic
mothers. Biochemical parameters were also similar for the two groups (infants of 
diabetic mothers and controls) (p > 0.05). We confirmed that there was a negative
correlation between birth weight and serum ghrelin level (p < 0.05) in the two
groups. When it was evaluated for control newborns, a positive correlation
between abdominal circumference and serum resistin level was found in the
controls (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that gestational diabetes by
appropriate diet or insulin treatment may be effective in the protection of
fetuses of diabetic mothers from the negative effects of gestational diabetes.
Ghrelin alone was negatively correlated with birth weight. This negative
correlation could be potentially advantageous to infants, because a reduction in 
appetite might prevent excessive food intake and postnatal weight gain.

We aimed to determine the presence of SKI-interacting protein (SKIP) expression
in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and its effect on prognosis by
investigating SKIP correlation with the Ki-67 proliferation index and prognostic 
parameters. Pathological preparations of the patients diagnosed with MPM between 
2006 and 2012 were evaluated. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to
evaluate the expression of SKIP and the Ki-67 proliferation index. Correlations
between SKIP expression, clinicopathological factors and survival were
investigated. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic value of the
variables. In total, 52 patients were evaluated in the study; 36 of them were
male and 16 were female. The mean age of the patients was 62.3 ±12.2 years. The
median overall survival period was 8.5 months. Factors negatively affecting
general survival in the univariate analysis included high SKIP expression, Ki-67 
proliferative index over 30%, presence of non-epithelioid type MPM and stage
III-IV disease (p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that high SKIP
expression, high Ki-67 proliferative index and presence of non-epithelioid type
MPM are independent factors that affect the survival rate. Higher SKIP expression
is associated with poor prognosis in MPM.

This study was aimed at evaluating the potential effects of acute subdural
hematoma (ASDH) and diclofenac sodium (DS) therapy following ASDH on the rat
hippocampus. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats were used and divided into four
groups. 0.1 ml of non-heparinized autologous blood from the tail vein of the
animals in the non-treatment group (NTG) and treatment group (TG) was injected
into the subdural space. The TG received intramuscular diclofenac sodium at a 15 
mg/kg dose daily from the postoperative second hour to the seventh day after the 
operation. The control group (CG) and sham group (SG) were used for control and
sham operations, respectively. On the postoperative eighth day, all animals were 
sacrificed, and the hippocampi of all animals were stereologically and
histologically evaluated. Also blood samples of the animals were biochemically
analyzed. As a result of the study, the mean number of neurons in CA1, CA2, and
CA3 regions of the hippocampus and the total number of neurons were decreased in 
the hippocampus samples of the NTG and especially the TG subjects. When comparing
the second blood samples, there was no difference between the levels of
adrenaline and serotonin among the groups. However, after the operation,
noradrenalin levels in the treatment group were found to be higher than those of 
the sham and control groups (p < 0.05). In the NTG and TG, histopathological
findings were observed such as Nissl condensation as well as completely dead and 
indistinguishable neurons with abnormally shaped, shrunken cytoplasm and nuclei. 
Also necrotic areas on the specimens of the TG were seen. In immunohistochemical 
sections, c-FOS positivity was decreased in the NTG and especially the TG.
Otherwise, PGC-1 positive cells were increased in the NTG and especially the TG.
In this study, it was shown for the first time by means of stereological
techniques that using DS after ASDH caused a decrease in the number of
hippocampal neurons (CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions).

Objective. Endocan has been shown to be a marker for several cancers and may show
degree of malignancy. The aim of this study is to assess tissue levels of endocan
in common brain tumors, namely, meningiomas, low-grade gliomas (LGGs), and
high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Patients and Methods. Endocan was assayed by
commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in a total 
of 50 brain tumors (20 meningiomas, 19 LGGs, and 20 HGGs) and 15 controls. The
results were compared to control brain tissues. Results. Each tumor group showed 
significant higher levels of endocan compared to controls (p < 0.05). In
addition, endocan levels showed steady increase from the least (meningiomas) to
the most (HGGs) malignant tumors and positive correlation was noted between the
degree of malignancy and endocan level (p = 0.0001). Conclusion. Endocan, a vital
molecule for angiogenesis, is expressed in common brain tumors and results
suggest that endocan could be a marker for malignancy.

BACKGROUND: Current cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend a 1-year
follow-up period for patients with a postmenopausal low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) who are test negative for high-risk human
papillomavirus (HrHPV). The aim of this study was to assess whether such patients
had an increased immediate risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.
METHODS: We assessed 54 HrHPV-negative women with postmenopausal LSIL in the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of our hospital between 2012 and 2013.
All patients underwent liquid-based cytology and reflex HrHPV testing (for human 
papillomavirus [HPV] types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66,
and 68). Colposcopic examination and guided biopsy were performed by the same
gynecologist (MO).
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 53.1 ± 3.2 years. There were 33
patients (61%) with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 and 21 who
were non-dysplastic. None of the patients was positive for CIN 2 or any other
lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: If the HPV test is negative, repeat cytology after 12 months is
recommended by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology for
cases of HrHPV-negative postmenopausal LSIL. We recommend reflex HPV testing as
the best choice for patients who test positive for postmenopausal LSIL by Pap
smear, in line with the literature. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:969-974. © 2016

Somatic activating mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) gene are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial
carcinoma (UC) of the bladder and upper urinary tract. Little is known, however, 
about TERT-mutation status in the relatively uncommon but clinically aggressive
micropapillary (MPC) variant. We evaluated the presence of TERT promoter
mutations in MPC of the bladder and upper urinary tract. A retrospective search
of our archives for MPC and UC with micropapillary features (2005-2014) was
performed. All slides were reviewed to confirm the histologic diagnosis.
Thirty-three specimens from 31 patients had FFPE blocks available for DNA
analysis and were included in the study. Intratumoral areas of non-micropapillary
histology were also evaluated when present. Samples were analyzed with Safe-SeqS,
a sequencing error reduction technology, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq
platform. TERT promoter mutations were detected in all specimens with pure MPC
(18 of 18) and UC with focal micropapillary features (15 of 15). Similar to
conventional UC, the predominant mutations identified occurred at positions -124 
(C228T) (85 %) and -146 (C250T) (12 %) bp upstream of the TERT ATG start site. In
heterogeneous tumors with focal variant histology, intratumoral concordant
mutations were found in variant (MPC and non-MPC) and corresponding conventional 
UC. We found TERT promoter mutations, commonly found in conventional UC, to be
frequently present in MPC. Our finding of concordant intratumoral mutational
alterations in cases with focal variant histology lends support to the common
oncogenesis origin of UC and its variant histology.

Granular cell tumors (GCTs) are rare and approximately half of the all lesions
arise from head and neck, especially from the tongue. However, they are rarely
seen in the vulva. They can occur in patients of any age, but peak age incidence 
is in the fourth to sixth decades. They generally occur as small, slow growing,
and skin-colored nodule. GCTs are usually benign, but malignant cases were
reported. Recurrence can be seen in benign tumors with clear margins, but rates
increase with positive margins. The treatment is complete surgical excision. We
report a case of benign GCT of the vulva. A 41-year-old patient presented with
vulvar mass, and biopsy was consisted with GCT.

Gorlin-Goltz syndrome (GGS) is an uncommon autosomal dominant inherited disorder 
which comprises the triad of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic
keratocysts, and musculoskeletal malformations. Besides this triad, neurological,
ophthalmic, endocrine, and genital manifestations are known to be variable. It is
occasionally associated with aggressive BCC and internal malignancies. This
report documents a case of GGS with a novel mutation in the PTCH1 gene in an
11-year-old child. The clinical, radiographic, histopathologic and molecular
findings of this condition, and treatment are described, and a review of GGS was 
carried out.

AIMS: Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen causing a wide range of
infections ranging from mild skin and soft tissue infections to severe,
life-threatening infections. Accuracy in the detection of methicillin resistance 
is important to avoid treatment failures. The aim of this study was to compare
the results of phenotypic and genotypic test methods to detect methicillin
resistance and also to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two S. aureus strains isolated from 
skin and soft tissue samples were analyzed for methicillin resistance using
oxacillin and cefoxitin disk diffusion (DD), oxacillin screen agar test,
cefoxitin E-test, and mecA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: 77 of 242 S. aureus isolates were mecA positive. Oxacillin, cefoxitin
DD, oxacillin screen agar test and cefoxitin E-test exhibited sensitivities as
98.7%, 98.7%, 100%, 100%, and specificities as 96.9%, 97.5%, 96.9%, 97.5%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Results of oxacillin screen agar and cefoxitin DD test were in
concordance with mecA gene PCR. Thus, it is determined that especially cefoxitin 
test can be an alternative to PCR in routine.

OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the importance of
tissue expressions of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and AT-rich interactive domain 1 alpha
(ARID-1A) which are known as signal regulator and tumor suppressor in
differential diagnosis of uterine smooth muscle tumors (SMTs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients recently diagnosed as uterine SMTs at the 
Tepecik Training and Research Hospital were identified using pathology databases.
Immunohistochemical stains for Cav-1 and ARID-1A were performed.
RESULTS: In this series, there were 10 leiomyosarcomas (LMSs), 10 uterine smooth 
muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potentials (STUMPs), and 10 leiomyomas
(LMs). Cav-1 expression located cytoplasmic or perivascular area. Cytoplasmic
Cav-1 expression was determined in 5 LMSs and 2 STUMPs while perivascular Cav-1
expression was determined in 9 LMSs and 2 STUMPs. Statistically, it was
determined that if the tumor becomes malignant and more invasive, it gains the
perivascular Cav-1 expression (P = 0.029). On the other hand, the mean nuclear
staining rate for ARID-1A in LMSs (63 ± 23.4%) was higher than both STUMPs (60 ± 
18.5%) and LMs (34.5 ± 16.5%). Statistically, it was determined that the
expression of ARID-1A was significantly downregulated in LMs when compared with
STUMPs and LMSs (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were demonstrated that perivascular Cav-1 expression
was seen to be a marker for malignancy of uterine SMTs. Similarly, we found to
link of ARID-1A expression and the aggressiveness of SMTs. Therefore, it may be
suggested that Cav-1 and ARID-1A may act as predictive biomarkers in uterine
SMTs.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB) is still difficult to diagnose
due to its varied clinical presentation and limitations of diagnostic methods.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of diagnostic laboratory tests 
available for CTB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six skin biopsy specimens belonging to clinically
suspected cases of CTB were studied retrospectively. The specimens were divided
into two portions, one part processed for histopathological evaluation and the
other was used for microscopy and inoculation for the isolation of mycobacteria. 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was applied to 14 of 26 specimens to
detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA.
RESULTS: Of the 26 biopsy specimens, 11 were confirmed as CTB by identification
of MTBC in culture and/or histopathologic affirmation. Of these, four were lupus 
vulgaris, four were TB verrucosa cutis, one was scrofuloderma, one was primary
inoculation TB, and one was periorifical CTB. Culture for mycobacteria was
positive for five (45.45%) specimens, while histopathologic affirmation was
obtained in ten (90.90%) specimens. Acid-fast Bacilli were not demonstrated in
any of the specimens on microscopic examination. The PCR was found to be applied 
to six of the 11 specimens diagnosed as CTB and was positive in two specimens
(33.3%), which were positive for growth in culture and histopathological
correlation.
CONCLUSION: The recovery rate of MTBC from biopsy specimens was found to be
satisfactory for CTB with histopathological correlation, but the combination of
culture with a rapid method, PCR, may improve the diagnostic rate.

Undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclastic giant cells of the pancreas (OGC)
are rare tumors. The current impression in the literature is that they are highly
aggressive tumors similar in prognosis to ductal adenocarcinomas. In this study, 
the clinicopathologic characteristics of 38 resected OGCs were investigated and
contrasted with 725 resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas without
osteoclastic cells (PDCs). The frequency among systematically reviewed pancreatic
cancers was 1.4%. OGCs showed a slight female predominance (62.9%, vs. 51.4% in
PDCs). The mean age was 57.9 years (vs. 65.0). The mean size of invasive cancer
was 5.3 cm (vs. 3.2). They were characterized by nodular, pushing-border growth, 
and 8 arose in tumoral intraepithelial neoplasms (4 in mucinous cystic neoplasms,
4 in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms type lesions), and 23 (61%) also
showed prominent intraductal/intracystic growth. Twenty-nine (76%) had an
invasive ductal/tubular adenocarcinoma component. Osteoid was seen in 12. Despite
their larger size, perineural invasion and nodal metastasis were uncommon (31.6% 
and 22.6%, vs. 85.5% and 64.0%, respectively). Immunohistochemistry performed on 
24 cases revealed that osteoclastic cells expressed the histiocytic marker CD68, 
and background spindle cells and pleomorphic/giant carcinoma cells often showed
p53 and often lacked cytokeratin. Survival of OGCs was significantly better than 
that of PDCs (5 yr, 59.1% vs. 15.7%, respectively, P=0.0009). In conclusion,
pancreatic OGCs present with larger tumor size and in slightly younger patients
than PDC, 21% arise in mucinous cystic neoplasms/intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms, and 61% show intraductal/intracystic polypoid growth. OGCs have a
significantly better prognosis than is currently believed in the literature.

Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma (IPM) is a benign mesenchymal neoplasm
originating from smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts. The inguinal region is
the most common site of this rare tumor. As there are only about 89 such cases
reported in the literature, the precise etiology and pathogenesis have yet to be 
explained adequately. It is characterized by spindle cells, amianthoid fibers,
and by the proliferation of hemosiderin-containing histiocytes in the lymph node.
A nodular lesion was excised from the inguinal region of a 47-year-old female
patient with the clinical diagnosis of lymphoma and/or metastase. Macroscopic
examination of a section of the lesion demonstrated a solid appearance.
Microscopic examination revealed spindle-cell proliferation, amianthoid fibers,
hemosiderin pigment, and extravasated erythrocytes. Nuclei of the spindle cells
displayed a palisaded appearance. Compressed lymphoid tissue was observed around 
the lesion. Neoplastic cells were identified by the presence of vimentin, SMA,
Cyclin D1, and beta-catenin. The Ki67 index was less than 1%. Histological
examination confirmed the diagnosis of IPM. Although IPM is benign, it is
frequently confused with metastatic lesions and lymphomas.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to define the histopathologic features and proliferative rate
of congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN) as a risk factor for recurrence.
METHODS: Fourteen cases of CMN among 138 registered pediatric renal tumors were
retrospectively reviewed. The prognostic impact for mitotic rate and Ki67 index
was investigated.
RESULTS: There were four (28.6%) classic, six (42.9%) cellular, and four (28.6%) 
mixed type CMNs, with average Ki-67 counts of 16.75% in the classic CMN, and
53.2% in the tumors with cellular components (both mixed and cellular CMNs).
Twelve patients (85.7%) were aged less than six months. Tumors with cellular
component showed significantly larger tumor diameter and higher Ki-67 index (p = 
0.015 and p = 0.016, respectively). The patient with cellular CMN, whose tumor
showed the highest mitotic rate (4.9/HPF), but not the highest Ki67 index
(57.4%), died of recurrent disease with distant metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Proliferative markers-mitotic count and Ki67 index-have limited value
to predict recurrence or metastasis in CMNs with a cellular component.

OBJECTIVES: In the field of laboratory medicine, minimizing errors and
establishing standardization is only possible by predefined processes. The aim of
this study was to build an experimental decision algorithm model open to
improvement that would efficiently and rapidly evaluate the results of
biochemical tests with critical values by evaluating multiple factors
concurrently.
METHODS: The experimental model was built by Weka software (Weka, Waikato, New
Zealand) based on the artificial neural network method. Data were received from
Dokuz Eylül University Central Laboratory. "Training sets" were developed for our
experimental model to teach the evaluation criteria. After training the system,
"test sets" developed for different conditions were used to statistically assess 
the validity of the model.
RESULTS: After developing the decision algorithm with three iterations of
training, no result was verified that was refused by the laboratory specialist.
The sensitivity of the model was 91% and specificity was 100%. The estimated κ
score was 0.950.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study based on an artificial neural network to
build an experimental assessment and decision algorithm model. By integrating our
trained algorithm model into a laboratory information system, it may be possible 
to reduce employees' workload without compromising patient safety.

Myofibroblastoma (MFB) is a benign tumor of the mammary stroma with predominant
myofibroblastic differention. The cytologic reports of MFB are very few in the
available literature. From the cytodiagnostic point of view about 21 cases of MFB
with cytological evaluation by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) have been
encountered in the English-language literature: A 35-year-old woman presented
with lump in the left breast. FNAC showed mild degree of pleomorphism with
occasional groups with fibrous stroma and tumoral cells. A few benign epithelial 
cell groups were seen. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of cell block
preparation from the aspirate showed fascicles of spindle cells forming whorl
structures. Three months later, excision biopsy was performed. The diagnosis was 
a classic variant of MFB. On immunohistochemical examination, sections were found
to be highly positive for vimentin, CD34, and bcl- 2. In light of these findings,
cell block material was retrospectively reviewed both morphologically and
immunhistochemically. The findings of resection and cell block material were
found to be very similar. MFB may cause a potential diagnostic pitfall while
interpreting FNAC due to its wide differential diagnosis spectrum. We concluded
that cytology and cell block findings complement each other. Diagn. Cytopathol.

BACKGROUND: Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign lesion of
myofibroblasts that is composed of a network of slit-like channels that resemble 
vascular spaces. The aims of this study were to document the frequency of PASH in
core needle biopsy specimens (CNBS) of the breast, to describe which
histopathologic findings coexist with PASH and to examine any endothelial cell
differentiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reevaluated hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of
all CNBS that were obtained during a 1-year period. First, we performed CD34 and 
CD31 immunostainings to highlight the areas of PASH, then performed
D2-40/podoplanin (lymphatic endothelial marker) and Fli-1 (vascular endothelial
cell marker) immunostains.
RESULTS: The total number of CNBS was 412. Areas of PASH were noted in 37 of the 
412 cases (9%), with a mean age of 38.5 years. The lesions that were described in
association with PASH were "benign breast parenchyma with stromal fibrosis"
(17/37; 46%), "fibroepithelial tumors" (17/37; 46%), "columnar cell changes
(CCC)" (2/37; 5%), and "invasive carcinoma" (1/37; 3%). There were 2 cases of CCC
within the foci of PASH (direct contact with PASH), and 8 additional cases of CCC
that coexisted in the same specimen but were not in direct contact. There was no 
staining for D2-40 or Fli-1 within PASH foci.
CONCLUSION: PASH lesions occurred with a frequency of 9% in CNBS and were mostly 
in association with benign breast lesions in premenopausal women. CCC was
determined as an accompanying epithelial lesion within or near PASH areas. No
obvious immunopositivity compatible with endothelial cell differentiation was
revealed.

BACKGROUND: The encapsulated follicular variant (EFV) of papillary thyroid
carcinoma (PTC) is the most discussed entity in thyroid pathology. Recently, the 
question of whether or not EFV-PTC is a malignant entity has been the subject of 
renewed discussion in the light of recent molecular and clinical studies. The aim
of this study was to analyze the malignancy ratios of each category of the
Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) if EFV-PTC is no
longer considered as a malignant entity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on thyroid fine-needle aspirations (n = 1,886) with
surgical follow-up between 1999 and 2014 were studied. EFV-PTC cases constituted 
27% (94/343) of the malignant cases.
RESULTS: Malignancy ratios were determined as nondiagnostic, benign,
atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, suspicious for follicular 
neoplasm/follicular neoplasm, suspicious for malignancy, and malignant categories
of the TBSRTC in 13, 7, 45, 30, 72 and 98%, respectively. If EFV-PTC was not
regarded as malignant, malignancy ratios would decrease to 6.5, 6, 30, 10, 48,
and 87% for each category in the same order.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that the most significant decrease in
relative malignancy ratios was seen in the suspicious for follicular
neoplasm/follicular neoplasm category (66% relative decrease), but all categories
represented a considerable decrease.

A lithopedion is a rare complication of pregnancy that occurs when a fetus in an 
intraabdominal location dies, and it is too large to be reabsorbed by the body.
The case was an 87-year-old woman, and she was transferred to the morgue
department in April 2014 to determine the cause of death. During autopsy, an
intraabdominally located calcified dead fetus and a 12-cm diameter calcified cyst
in the right ovary were incidentally detected. It was aged 25 to 29 weeks
(according to femur and humerus measurements) with a size of 12.5 × 8 × 5 cm and 
a weight of 227 g. According to investigation reports, her husband died in 1990, 
and she had 3 deliveries, the most recent of which was in 1946. Because the
menopause age of the case was not exactly known, the retention time of the
lithopedion was supposed to be 24 to 68 years according to the date of the most
recent pregnancy and the date of her spouse's death. It is the first case that
has been incidentally detected and identified during an autopsy in Turkey and
also one of the oldest cases in the literature.

OBJECTIVE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) have shown benefits regarding progression-free and overall survival in
patients whose tumours show EGFR mutations. Most patients' lung cancer is
metastatic when detected. Small tissue samples and cytological materials are
widely used in diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to compare the EGFR
mutation analysis results between cytology, small biopsies and resections.
METHODS: Archival material for EGFR testing was reviewed. Cell blocks and/or
stained smears and tissue blocks were used where appropriate. The tumour cell
count and percentage were recorded as well as the DNA content. The influence of
TTF-1 immunoreactivity on EGFR testing was also investigated.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 300 unpaired specimens of 84 resections, 83
small biopsies and 133 cytological materials. EGFR mutation rates did not differ 
significantly for cytology, small biopsy and resections (P > 0.05). The higher
tumour cell percentage in FNAs than in exfoliative cytology did not affect the
EGFR mutation status. EGFR mutation rates were similar when either slides or cell
blocks were used. Cytology slides revealed a higher tumour cell content and DNA
concentration than the cell blocks. May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG)-stained smears had 
higher rates of the EGFR mutation than the Papanicolaou (Pap)-stained slides (P <
0.05). Tumours with negative immunoreactivity for TTF-1 are less likely to have
an EGFR mutation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Cytological materials can be used successfully for mutation analysis
in lung cancer.

Background and Aim. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, amount of blood transfusion,
and trauma scores on morbidity in patients with solid organ injury following
trauma. Material and Method. One hundred nine patients with solid organ injury
due to abdominal trauma during January 2005 and October 2015 were examined
retrospectively in the General Surgery Department of Dicle University Medical
Faculty. Patients' age, gender, trauma interval time, vital status (heart rate,
arterial tension, and respiratory rate), hematocrit (HCT) value, serum area
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values, presence of
free abdominal fluid in USG, trauma mechanism, extra-abdominal system injuries,
injured solid organs and their number, degree of injury in abdominal CT, number
of blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, time of operation (for those
undergoing operation), trauma scores (ISS, RTS, Glasgow coma scale, and TRISS),
and causes of morbidity and mortality were examined. In posttraumatic follow-up
period, intra-abdominal hematoma infection, emboli, catheter infection, and deep 
vein thrombosis were monitored as factors of morbidity. Results. One hundred nine
patients were followed up and treated due to isolated solid organ injury
following abdominal trauma. There were 81 males (74.3%) and 28 females (25.7%),
and the mean age was 37.6 ± 18.28 (15-78) years. When examining the mechanism of 
abdominal trauma in patients, the following results were obtained: 58 (53.3%)
traffic accidents (22 out-vehicle and 36 in-vehicle), 27 (24.7%) falling from a
height, 14 (12.9%) assaults, 5 (4.5%) sharp object injuries, and 5 (4.5%) gunshot
injuries. When evaluating 69 liver injuries scaled by CT the following was
detected: 14 (20.3%) of grade I, 32 (46.4%) of grade II, 22 (31.8%) of grade III,
and 1 (1.5%) of grade IV. In 63 spleen injuries scaled by CT the following was
present: grade I in 21 (33.3%), grade II in 27 (42.9%), grade III in 11 (17.5%), 
and grade IV in 4 (6.3%). The mean length of hospital stay after trauma was 6.46 
days in the medically followed patients. This ratio was 8.13 days in 22 patients 
with morbidity and 5.98 days in 78 patients without morbidity. There was a
morbidity in 22 (22%) patients medically followed after trauma. In this study,
nonoperative treatment was observed to be performed safely in solid organ
injuries after trauma in case of absence of hemodynamic stability and peritoneal 
irritation. It has been emphasized that injury of both liver and spleen (p <
0.01), high respiratory rate (p < 0.01), trauma scores (GKS, ISS, RTS) (p <
0.0001), and elevation of ALT AST values (p < 0.01) are stimulants for morbidity 
that may occur during follow-up. Conclusion. Medical follow-up can be considered 
in patients with high grade injuries similar to patients with low-grade solid
organ injury after trauma. The injury of both liver and spleen, high respiratory 
rate, high GCS and ISS, low RTS, and elevation of ALT AST values were found to
increase morbidity again in the follow-up of these patients.

Tunicamycin is an inhibitor of glycosylation that disturbs protein folding
machinery in eukaryotic cells. Tunicamycin causes accumulation of unfolded
proteins in cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress. ER stress is
an essential mechanism for cellular homeostasis has role in cell death via
reprogramming of protein processing, regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. In
this study we show effect of tunicamycin on subpopulation and invasion of
CD44+/CD24- MCF7 breast cancer stem cells. CD44+/CD24- cells were isolated from
MCF7 cell line by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and treated with
tunicamycin. ER stress was monitored by evaluation of X-box binding protein
1(XBP-1) mRNA splicing, cleaved activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) nuclear 
translocation and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)
expression. CD44+/CD24- subpopulation was analyzed using flow cytometry. Invasion
was investigated by scratch assay, trypan blue staining,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) proliferation 
and in vitro migration assays. Increased level of spliced XBP-1, ATF6 nuclear
translocation and CHOP protein expression were detected in CD44+/CD24- and
original MCF7 cells treated with tunicamycin. Also, a significant decline in
CD44+/CD24- cell subpopulation was determined in the cells treated with
tunicamycin. The results also showed inhibited invasion, increased cell death,
suppressed proliferation and reduced migration in the CD44+/CD24- and CD44+/CD24-
rich MCF7 cell culture, under effect of tunicamycin. Our results indicate that
CD44+/CD24- phenotype MCF7 cells are susceptible to tunicamycin. The results
showed that tunicamycin-induced ER stress suppresses CD44+/CD24- phenotype cell
subpopulation and in vitro invasion and accelerates tumorosphore formation. These
results suggest that tunicamycin-induced ER stress inhibits CD44+/CD24- phenotype
MCF7 breast cancer stem cells. We conclude that using ER-targeting chemicals like
tunicamycin is an interesting approach to target breast cancer stem cells inside 
tumor.

BACKGROUND: Many factors contribute to the development of BPD basically by
increasing inflammation in preterm lungs. However, premature neonates have
insufficient anti-inflammatory capacity. We aimed to evaluate the effect of
etanercept, an anti-TNF agent, on BPD development in newborn rat model with
hyperoxia-induced lung injury.
METHODS: Thirty-two newborn rats were divided into 3 groups as control group
(Group 1, n = 11), hyperoxia + placebo group (Group 2, n = 10), and hyperoxia +
etanercept group (Group 3, n = 11). Histopathological and biochemical analysis
were performed in order to assess inflammation and oxidative stress. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and malondialdehyde 
(MDA) levels were studied, histopathological scoring and radial alveolar count
were applied in lung tissue. Lamellar body membrane protein, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) gene expressions were studied
in immunohistochemical evaluation of tissue samples. All three groups were
compared with each other in terms of all parameters.
RESULTS: SOD and GSH-Px activities were significantly higher, whereas MDA levels 
were lower in group 3, compared to group 2 (p < 0.001). Histopathological scores 
were lower, lamellar body membrane protein expression and radial alveolar count
were higher in group 3 (p < 0.05). NF-κB expression was higher in group 2, but
lower in group 3 in comparison with group 1. Expression of VEGF was decreased in 
group 2 but came close to group 1 with etanercept treatment in group 3.
CONCLUSIONS: We found etanercept treatment to be protective in newborn rats with 
hyperoxia-induced lung damage.

Tetrasomy 18p, characterized by the presence of four copies of the short arm of
chromosome 18, is considered to occur with the nondisjunction in meiosis II after
the errors in the meiotic and early postmeiotic mitotic division in the
centromere. It is accompanied by various abnormalities including congenital heart
defects, lower extremity abnormalities, micrognathia, high arched palate,
kyphoscoliosis, microcephaly, myelomeningocele, hernia and renal anomalies. We
present the first case of a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy in which both
fetuses were affected by tetrasomy 18p, but with discordant morphology, detected 
in one twin in the first but in the other in the second trimester.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the first choice in thyroid nodules suspected of 
harboring malignancy on sonography in routine practice. However, sampling with
core needle biopsy (CNB) is also being used, especially in cases with repeated
nondiagnostic/indeterminate diagnoses. The aim of this study was the
retrospective evaluation of CNB samples. A total of 604 thyroid CNB samples
registered in the Department of Pathology at Bezmialem Foundation University
Medical Faculty within the 1-year period between June 2014 and June 2015 were
re-evaluated by correlation with previous FNA and later resection results. CNB
was divided into diagnostic groups of insufficient, malignant, suspicious for
malignancy, no evidence of malignancy/benign, atypia of uncertain significance
(AUS)/follicular lesions of uncertain significance (FLUS), and follicular
neoplasm (FN)/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN). Among the 604 cases, 15
cases (2.48 %) were classified as malignant and 9 cases (1.49 %) as suspicious
for malignancy. No evidence of malignancy was seen in 512 cases (84.76 %). There 
were 26 (4.3 %) cases in the AUS/FLUS-FN/SFN group, and the sample was inadequate
in 42 cases (6.95 %). Resection was performed for 17 of the cases classified as
malignant or suspicious for malignancy, and all were found to be malignant. There
were also 10 resected cases with a diagnosis of no evidence of malignancy, and
all were found to be benign. We think that sampling with CNB may be useful
especially in repeating inadequate biopsies or cases diagnosed with AUS/FLUS that
have hesitations regarding clinical management. Larger series including
comparisons with FNA and resection results are required.

Objectives The aims of this study are to evaluate expressions of Ki67, RacGAP1
(MgcRacGAP) and topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2a), the markers related with cell
proliferation that have been proposed to affect the prognosis in the literature
and correlate the results with clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer
patients. Methods Ki67, RacGAP1, and TOP2a antibodies were applied
immunohistochemically to the tissue micrarray blocks of 457 female breast cancer 
patients. The results were correlated with clinical, prognostic,
histopathological features, and other immunohistochemical findings (estrogen
receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], HER2, cytokeratin [CK]5/6, CK14,
epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] and vimentin), statistically. Results
Ki67 expression demonstrated direct correlation with TOP2a expression, mitotic
count, tumor grade, geographic necrosis, basal-like phenotype. RacGAP1 expression
was directly correlated with TOP2a expression, nipple invasion, and number of
metastatic lymph nodes, and it was inversely correlated with PR expression. TOP2a
expression was directly correlated with vimentin and Ki67 expressions, mitotic
count, tumor grade, and geographic necrosis, and nipple invasion, and negatively 
correlated with ER and PR expressions. Higher TOP2a and Ki67 expressions were
correlated with shorter overall survival. Higher TOP2a expression and RacGAP1
positivity were directly correlated with shorter disease-free survival.
Conclusion This study showed that the overexpressions of Ki67, RacGAP1, and TOP2a
affect the prognosis adversely, thus to develop target therapies against RacGAP1 
and TOP2a as well as using Ki67 as a part of routine pathology practice might be 
beneficial in breast cancer therapy and prediction of prognosis.

Thyroid tumors of uncertain malignant potential (TT-UMP) comprise an accepted
subgroup of follicular-patterned thyroid tumors for which benignancy or
malignancy cannot be precisely assessed. We aimed to evaluate the demographic
characteristics, ultrasound (US) findings, and cytological results of patients
with TT-UMP and compare these findings to a classical variant of papillary
thyroid carcinoma (CV-PTC) and non-encapsulated follicular variant of PTC
(NEFV-PTC) patients; we also evaluated the immunohistochemical characteristics of
patients with TT-UMP. Twenty-four patients with TT-UMP, 672 with CV-PTC, and 132 
with NEFV-PTC were included in the study. Mean longitudinal nodule size and
median nodule volume were higher in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC and
NEFV-PTC groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 for CV-PTC; p < 0.001 and p = 0.008 for 
NEFV-PTC). The presence of halo and peripheral vascularization was observed more 
frequently in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC group (p = 0.002 and
p = 0.024). Benign and follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm
cytological results were higher in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC group
(p = 0.030 and p = 0.001). US findings were similar between TT-UMP and NEFV-PTC
groups (all, p > 0.05). However, none of the patients with TT-UMP were called
malignant; 105 patients (31.2 %) of CV-PTC and 11 patients (9.5 %) of NEFV-PTC
(infiltrative FV) were classified as malignant cytologically. Tumor size was
higher in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC and NEFV-PTC groups (p < 0.001 and 
p = 0.006). In the TT-UMP group, positive expression of HBME-1, CK-19, and Gal-3 
was found in 50, 33.3, and 25 % of patients, respectively. This study
demonstrated that none of the TT-UMP patients were evaluated as malignant in
preoperative cytology. However, patients with TT-UMP had higher nodule and tumor 
sizes than CV-PTC and NEFV-PTC patients; US features were similar between
NEFV-PTC and TT-UMP patients.

p21 and p27 are members of cyclin-dependent kinase family, which function as
tumor suppressors and they are involved in development and progression of several
malignancies. We investigated their expression in upper urinary tract urothelial 
carcinoma (UUTUC). Radical nephroureterectomy materials of 34 patients were
assessed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate expression of p21 and p27 in UUTUC. 
Results were correlated with various clinicopathological variables as age,
gender, tumor grade and stage, tumor architecture, multifocality, subsequent
bladder carcinoma development and clinical outcome.p21 and p27 expression was
observed in 52.9 % (n = 18) and 88.2 % (n = 30), respectively. A total of 21
tumors (61.7 %) showed either total loss of p21 expression (n = 16, 47 %) or
lower expression (n = 5, 14.7 %). No correlation was found between p21 expression
and clinicopathologic variables. Cases showing total loss or lower p27 expression
(11.7 % and <25.6 %, respectively) (n = 19, 55.8 %) constituted 67.6 % (n = 23)
of the cases totally. This loss or lower p27 expression correlated with a shorter
overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis (p = 0.039 and
p = 0.037, respectively). None of the noninvasive tumors (papillary and nodular
tumors) showed loss of p27 (p = 0.016) while 33.3 % of invasive ones showed p27
loss. Noninvasive tumor architecture also correlated with subsequent bladder
carcinoma development (p = 0.032) while invasive tumor architecture correlated
with advanced stage (T3 and T4) (p = 0.003). p27 is widely expressed in UUTUC,
while p21 expression is observed in half of the cases. Loss of p27 expression
correlated with tumor architecture and overall survival in UUTUC. However,
further research is needed to assess their role in UUTUC.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) are common human carcinomas. Despite
having metastasizing capacities, they usually show less aggressive progression
compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of other organs. Metastasis suppressor 
proteins (MSPs) are a group of proteins that control and slow-down the metastatic
process. In this study, we established the importance of seven well-defined MSPs 
including NDRG1, NM23-H1, RhoGDI2, E-cadherin, CD82/KAI1, MKK4, and AKAP12 in
cSCCs. Protein expression levels of the selected MSPs were detected in 32 cSCCs, 
6 in situ SCCs, and two skin cell lines (HaCaT, A-431) by immunohistochemistry.
The results were evaluated semi-quantitatively using the HSCORE system. In
addition, mRNA expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR in the cell lines. The 
HSCOREs of NM23-H1 were similar in cSCCs and normal skin tissues, while RGHOGDI2,
E-cadherin and AKAP12 were significantly downregulated in cSCCs compared to
normal skin. The levels of MKK4, NDRG1 and CD82 were partially conserved in
cSCCs. In stage I SCCs, nuclear staining of NM23-H1 (NM23-H1nuc) was
significantly lower than in stage II/III SCCs. Only nuclear staining of MKK4
(MKK4nuc) showed significantly higher scores in in situ carcinomas compared to
invasive SCCs. In conclusion, similar to other human tumors, we have demonstrated
complex differential expression patterns for the MSPs in in-situ and invasive
cSCCs. This complex MSP signature warrants further biological and experimental
pathway research.

Gallbladder cancers (GBC) are characterized by rapid progression, early
metastasis, and poor prognosis; the molecular mechanisms of the various signaling
pathways involved should be elucidated to develop effective therapies. Survivin, 
an apoptosis inhibitor protein expressed in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle,
plays a role in cell division and affects both cell survival and proliferation.
Survivin has been investigated in many types of cancer, and this study aims to
examine the relationship of survivin expression in gallbladder cancer patients
with clinicopathological features and prognosis. We evaluated demographic
characteristics (age, gender), tumor characteristics (histopathological type,
differentiation, perineural, and lymphovascular invasion; serosal invasion,
surgical margin positivity and lymphocytic response), and Survivin expression
immunohistochemically, and we analysed the relationship between these
characteristics and prognosis in 47 gallbladder carcinoma cases from 2000 to
2011. Immunohistochemically, while survivin expression was observed in 36 cases, 
it was absent in 11 cases. Follow-up data were obtained from 32 patients. Two
(8.7%) of 23 cases with a Survivin-positive tumor were alive at 74th and 35th
months, whereas 5 (%55.6) of nine cases with Survivin-negative tumor were alive
at 50th, 89th, 124th, 126th, 131th months. Survivin expression was correlated
with short survival (p = 0.043), and the univariate analysis showed that reduced 
overall survival was associated with age (p = 0.043), male gender (p = 0.038),
infiltrative pattern (p = 0.019), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.004), perineural
invasion (p = 0.009), serosal invasion (p = 0.027), ulcer (p = 0.033), and
surgical margin positivity (p = 0.022). Despite the low number of patients in our
study, the analysis results suggest that survivin positivity might actually be a 
significant prognostic factor. This finding could be a reference point for
targeted treatment studies. However, further studies involving broader series and
longer follow-up are still required for highly lethal gallbladder cancers.

Small B cell lymphoid neoplasms are the most common lymphoproliferative disorders
involving peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM). The Bone Marrow Workshop
(BMW) organized by the European Bone Marrow Working Group (EBMWG) of the European
Association for Haematopathology (EAHP) during the XVIIth EAHP Meeting in
Istanbul, October 2014, was dedicated to discussion of cases illustrating how the
recent advances in immunophenotyping, molecular techniques and cytogenetics
provide better understanding and classification of these entities. Submitted
cases were grouped into following categories: (i) cases illustrating diagnostic
difficulties in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); (ii) cases of BM
manifestations of small B cell lymphoid neoplasms other than CLL; (iii)
transformation of small B cell lymphoid neoplasms in the BM; and (iv)
multiclonality and composite lymphomas in the BM. This report summarizes
presented cases and conclusions of the BMW and provides practical recommendations
for classification of the BM manifestations of small B cell lymphoid neoplasms
based on the current state of knowledge.

AIM: To determine the function of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with
thrombospondin motifs-4 (ADAMTS4), total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant 
status (TAS), and aryl esterase (ARES) in preterm premature rupture of membranes 
(PPROM) and to investigate the association with premature rupture of membranes
(PROMs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 58 pregnant women were included in this prospective study
which comprised 29 PPROM patients as the study group and 29 patients, having
healthy amniotic membranes, as the control group. ADAMTS4, TAS, TOS, and ARES
levels were studied in the amniotic membrane homogenates of the patients.
RESULTS: ADAMTS4, TAS TOS, and ARES levels of amniotic membrane lysates were
significantly different between PPROM and control groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p
= 0.008 and p = 0.002, respectively). Increased amniotic membrane ADAMTS4 (OR:
1.051 95% CI 1.006-1.098, p = 0.024) and TOS (OR: 12.777 95% CI 1.595-102.323, p 
= 0.016) were found to be significantly associated with the increased risk of
PPROM.
CONCLUSION: ADAMTS4, TOS, and ARES levels were higher and TAS level was lower in 
PPROM patients than the normal healthy control group which had healthy amniotic
membranes at term. As a result, ADAMTS4 may have a role in the pathogenesis by
causing increased oxidative and inflammatory environment in PPROM.

BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 96
consecutive cases with classical variant papillary thyroid cancer, and
immunohistochemical staining of Na+/I- symporter (NIS) protein was evaluated.
Localization (intracellular or membranous), density, and the intensity of
cytoplasmic staining were characterized semiquantitatively. Extrathyroidal
invasion, surgical margin positivity, and lymph node metastasis were compared
with BRAF(V600E) mutation and NIS expression. Eighty-eight patients who had at
least 24-month follow-up were also included in survival analysis. BRAF(V600E)
mutation was determined in 78.1% (75/96) and functional NIS activity in 74%
(71/96) of the cases. There were statistically significant differences in mean
ages between BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive (48.6) and BRAF(V600E)
mutation-negative cases (37.3; Levene test, P=.419; Student t test, P=.001). The 
surgical margin positivity (46.7%) and extrathyroidal extension percentage
(54.7%) in the BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive group were higher than the negative 
(28.6% and 33.3%, respectively) group, without statistical significance (P=.138
and P=.084, respectively). Functional NIS activity was higher in BRAF(V600E)
mutation-positive cases (78.1%) than mutation-negative ones (57.1%; P=.047). The 
possibility of moderate and intense cytoplasmic staining in BRAF(V600E)
mutation-positive cases (72%) was 6.3 times higher than the possibility of weak
staining (28%) in the mutation-positive cases (95% confidence interval, 2.2-18.8;
P=.001). Functional NIS expression is higher in patients with classical variant
papillary thyroid cancer with BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, the clinical
features were not found to be associated with NIS expression. There may be
different mechanisms determining the outcome of therapy.

Our first aim was to determine the total leukocyte profile in implantation.
Second aim was to detect the changes in uterine leukocyte profile in diabetes, a 
common accompanying disease. For this purpose 4 groups are formed with Wistar
albino rats weighing 250-300 g. Two of the groups were non-diabetic and two of
them were diabetic. One of the diabetic and one of the non-diabetic groups were
left pregnant. Then uterus tissues of pregnant animals were removed in the 5th
and 7th days of pregnancy together with tissues of other two non-pregnant groups.
Tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically with antibodies CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, 
CD56, CD68 and CD79a. It was revealed that pregnancy increased immune staining of
CD68, CD3, CD45 and CD56 in endometrium. In addition it was observed that immune 
staining density of CD68, CD45 and CD56 decreased in diabetes. In the
histopathological examination, significant degeneration was detected in the
endometrium of diabetic rats. Diabetes could decrease leukocyte proportions in
decidua in early pregnancy periods. Therefore immune cell therapies could be
administrated in diabetes related problems of pregnancy.

Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour (RGNT) of the fourth ventricle is one of the 
newly described primary tumours of the central nervous system. These tumours have
two components of both neurocytic and glial areas but usually the glial component
of the tumour predominates. They have biphasic cytoarchitecture with two
elements; neurocytic rosettes resembling Homer-Wright rosettes, and astrocytic
component resembling a pilocytic astrocytoma. They are low-grade tumours with
lack of histopathological signs of malignancy. Here, clinical, magnetic
resonance, computed tomography (CT) and pathological features of rosette-forming 
glioneuronal tumour of posterior fossa are presented. A 29-year-man was admitted 
with an acute neurological deterioration. A three ventricular hydrocephalus and a
hypo-density around vermis in the posterior fossa were seen in his CT scans. He
did well after an emergency external ventricular drainage. He had an elective
operation and a mass that was reported to be a rosette-forming glioneuronal
tumour of the fourth ventricle was excised.

Thyroid Paraganglioma Diagnosed by Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy, Correlated With
Histopathological Findings: Report of a Case.

Author information: 
(1)Pathology Department, Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul,

Thyroid paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors. They are difficult to
diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and can be misdiagnosed as
other types of thyroid disease. Here, we present an unusual case of primary
thyroid paraganglioma diagnosed by FNAB. A 66-year-old woman presented with
multinodular goiter. Ultrasound (US)-guided FNAB of the 3 cm nodule in the
superior portion of the right lobe of the thyroid was performed. The cytological 
smears showed single cells or loose clusters of round to ovoid cells with oval
granular nuclei. To differentiate between thyroid paraganglioma and other thyroid
neoplasms, cell block material from the FNAB specimen was immunohistochemically
stained with antibodies to thyroglobulin, calcitonin (CT), AE1-AE3,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), synaptophysin, chromogranin A (CH-A),
neuron-specific enolase (NSE), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1),
parathyroid hormone (PTH), and S-100. Immunohistochemical staining was positive
for synaptophysin, CH-A, NSE, and S-100, and negative for thyroglobulin, CT,
AE1-AE3, PTH, CEA, and TTF-1. Congo red staining was also negative. Paraganglioma
and other neuroendocrine neoplasms were considered in the differential diagnosis.
A total thyroidectomy was performed, and a final diagnosis of paraganglioma was
made. Paraganglioma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the thyroid and should be
considered in the differential diagnosis based on cytology of thyroid
neuroendocrine tumors. Immunohistochemistry should be performed when making a
diagnosis of thyroid paraganglioma, particularly when evaluating fine-needle
aspiration smears. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:643-647. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide gene expression profiling analysis of FFPE tissue samples
is indispensable for cancer research and provides the opportunity to evaluate
links between molecular and clinical information, however, working with FFPE
samples is challenging due to extensive cross-linking, fragmentation and limited 
quantities of nucleic acid. Thus, processing of FFPE tissue samples from RNA
extraction to microarray analysis still needs optimization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a modified deparaffinization protocol was
conducted prior to RNA isolation. Trizol, Qiagen RNeasy FFPE and Arcturus
PicoPure RNA Isolation kits were used in parallel to compare their impact on RNA 
isolation. We also evaluated the effect of two different cRNA/cDNA preparation
and labeling protocols with two different array platforms (Affymetrix Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 and U133_X3P) on the percentage of present calls.
RESULTS: Our optimization study shows that the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE kit with
modified deparaffinization step gives better results (RNA quantity and quality)
than the other two isolation kits. The Ribo-SPIA protocol gave a significantly
higher percentage of present calls than the 3' IVT cDNA amplification and
labeling system. However, no significant differences were found between the two
array platforms.
CONCLUSION: Our study paves the way for future high-throughput transcriptional
analysis by optimizing FFPE tissue sample processing from RNA isolation to
microarray analysis.

AIM: We aim to determine the role of serum and placental A disintegrin and
metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in fetal growth
restriction (FGR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 43 pregnancies suffering FGR and 45 healthy ones were
homogenized for their body mass indices, ages, and gestational weeks. Expression 
of ADAMTS5 in placental samples was determined by immunohistochemical methods and
concurrent maternal serum ADAMTS5 levels were determined with enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Expression of ADAMTS5 was higher in FGR group than the healthy control
in placenta. Both the cytoplasmic staining pattern of the syncytiotrophoblasts
and staining of the decidual plate were shown in the FGR group; but not in the
control group. A negative correlation between serum ADAMTS5 levels and birth
weight in FGR group was observed.
CONCLUSION: Increased ADAMTS5 levels were observed in placental insufficiency
cases. This study demonstrates that ADAMTS5 may be a sensitive indicator of
placental insufficiency which has variable factors in etiology. Additional work
is needed to delineate the mechanism of its involvement.

Our aim is to identify maternal risk factors and to determine placental
histopathologies in preterm stillbirths. We designed a prospective study
involving a patient population (n = 136) composed of singleton stillbirth (n =
40) and singleton live-born neonates (n = 96) between 23 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of 
gestation. We divided the stillbirths into groups of early (n = 21) and late (n =
19) stillbirths. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15
software. Small birth weight for gestational age and oligo-anhydramnios were
significantly higher in the early stillbirth group (p = 0.001, p = 0.002
respectively). Antenatal follow up was significantly lower in the late stillbirth
group (p = 0.001). Placental weight was statistically lower in the early
stillbirth group (p = 0.001). We found no significant differences in maternal
vascular underperfusion, fetal vascular obstruction, inflammation and villitis of
unknown etiology. Placental pathologies causing preterm labor may play an
important role in the etiology of stillbirths and antenatal follow up is
essential for each pregnancy.

This study compared the expression profile of HBME-1 and claudin-1 in 90
papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) with respect to the tumor architecture and
invasive growth as reflected in 46 BRAF-like, 31 non-invasive RAS, and 13
invasive RAS-like phenotypes. Individual tumors were given an expression score
(max 300) by multiplying the percent positive tumor cells by the intensity score 
(range 0-3). The higher expression of HBME-1 and claudin-1 distinguished
BRAF-like phenotype from RAS-like phenotype. The same correlation was also
retained for both markers when comparing BRAF-like phenotype with non-invasive
and invasive RAS-like phenotypes. The expression scores and positivity rates for 
both markers did not yield any statistical difference among BRAF-like PTCs.
Except the higher positivity rate of HBME-1, invasive RAS-like tumors were not
statistically different than their non-invasive counterparts with respect to the 
positivity rate of claudin-1 and the expression scores of both markers. A central
lymph node dissection or selective lymph node sampling was available in 20
specimens. The absence of claudin-1 expression has not been a feature of lymph
node metastasis in this series. Despite the limited number of nodal sampling,
BRAF-like phenotype and claudin-1 positivity status have been considered the best
determinants of positive predictive value and negative predictive value in the
prediction of lymph node metastasis among variables, respectively. Adoption of
the simplified architectural classification approach to PTCs showed distinct
biomarker expression profile in this series; however, immunohistochemistry for
HBME-1 and claudin-1 does not seem to be useful in the distinction of invasive
RAS-like PTCs from their non-invasive counterparts. Given the overlapping
molecular signatures within the RAS-like phenotype, further studies with
additional biomarkers are still needed to identify distinct protein expression
signatures of non-invasive RAS-like phenotype as this diagnostic category still
remains a surgical diagnosis at this time.

INTRODUCTION: The term intracholecystic papillary-tubular neoplasm (ICPN) is
suggested by some authors for a group of exophytic lesions of the gallbladder. In
our study, demographic, pathological, and immunohistochemical features of 45 ICPN
cases and their relationship with invasive carcinoma were analyzed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 45 ICPN cases were retrieved out of 7334
cholecystectomies performed between1996 and 2014. Cases were evaluated with
regard to demographic, pathological, and immunohistochemical features.
Correlation between the clinical and histopathological data and occurrence of
invasion was sought.
RESULTS: The incidence of ICPN was 0.61% in our series. Invasive carcinoma was
observed in 56% of cases. Factors associated with invasion were diffuse
high-grade dysplasia (P = .002), papillary growth pattern (P = .001), greatest
diameter of the lesion, and high Ki67 proliferation index (P < .0001).
DISCUSSION: Some authors have reported that small intracholecystic exophytic
lesions without high-grade dysplasia are considered to be inconsequential.
However, there are not enough data concerning the features of large lesions with 
high-grade dysplasia and their prognoses. Our data suggest that cases with
diffuse high-grade dysplasia and tubulopapillary/papillary growth pattern, large 
tumor size, and high Ki67 proliferation index should be studied for the presence 
of invasion.

Recognition that a fetus can scarlessly heal in intrauterine life led to various 
animal studies in the mid 1980s exploring the possibility of fetal cleft
lip/palate surgery. The idea of scarless cleft repair seemed like a possible
dream after the promising results from the early animal studies. In this review, 
we analyze the progress made in the 30 years since our first experience with
animal models.

AIM: To evaluate the mode of delivery's influence on development of neonatal
hyperbilirubinemia in term or near term infants.
METHODS: The hyperbilirubinemic neonates were divided into two groups according
to their mode of delivery (i.e., vaginal or cesarean). The birth weight and
gestational age at the time of birth, the age of the neonates in days, and the
serum levels of bilirubin of the neonates at the time of hyperbilirubinemia were 
compared from the date of hospitalization until treatment, based on the birth
model.
RESULTS: 288 were fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the neonatal period.
The vaginal delivery group consisted of 157 infants (16.8%) with
hyperbilirubinemia, whereas the cesarean group included 131 (22.6%) infants with 
hyperbilirubinemia. Neonates in the cesarean group had a significantly higher
rate of hyperbilirubinemia (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that compared with vaginal births, cesarean
births led to higher rates of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the cytomorphometric
characteristics of the buccal cells of Behçet's disease patients with those of
healthy controls.
METHODS: This case-control study compared a group of 30 patients with Behçet's
disease with an age- and gender-matched control group of 30 healthy individuals. 
The buccal mucosal smears were stained using the Papanicolaou technique for
cytomorphometric analyses. The nuclear and cytoplasmic areas were evaluated using
digital image analysis; the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic areas and nuclear
roundness are presented.
RESULTS: The nuclear and cytoplasmic areas of the BD patients' cells were
significantly smaller than those of the healthy controls' cells, while the
nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and neutrophil infiltration rate did not differ
significantly between the groups. However, the nuclear area, cytoplasmic area,
nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and nuclear roundness factor were significantly
higher in patients without aphthae. The neutrophil infiltration rate did not
differ significantly in patients with or without aphthae.
CONCLUSION: Behçet's disease can produce cytomorphometric changes in buccal cells
that are detectable by exfoliative cytology and cytomorphometric analysis
techniques.

AIM: To determine the methylation pattern of the promoter region of the
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene in laryngeal cancer and normal
laryngeal mucosa samples using pyrosequencing, and to determine the relationship 
between the methylation pattern of MGMT, and tumor stage, survival, recurrence,
and chemosensitivity in patients with laryngeal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laryngeal cancer and normal laryngeal mucosa specimens
were obtained from our paraffin block archives, and then subjected to
pyrosequencing. Different cut-off values were used to detect methylation.
Clinicopathological data for the patients that provided specimens were obtained
from archive records.
RESULTS: When 5% was used as the cut-off value, 78% of the laryngeal cancer
specimens (64 of 82), and 27.3% of normal laryngeal mucosa specimens (3 of 11)
were considered methylated. When 10% was used as the cut-off value, 47% of the
laryngeal cancer specimens (39 of 82), and none of the normal laryngeal mucosa
specimens were considered methylated. There was not a significant relationship
between the methylation status of MGMT, and clinicopathological parameters,
including age, tumor stage, histopathological differentiation, chemoradiotherapy 
protocol used, recurrence, or disease-free survival.
CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing is a reliable semiquantitative technique that can be
used to detect the methylation pattern. Methylation was common in the laryngeal
cancer specimens, but there was not a significant relationship between the
methylation status of MGMT and clinicopathological parameters.

Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a rare, aggressive form of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma that is generally incurable at more advanced stages with systemic
involvement. Clonal diagnostic markers (eg, unique T- or B-cell receptor
rearrangements) are not available for NKTCLs. Killer cell immunoglobulin like
receptors (KIRs) are a family of type I transmembrane glycoproteins involved in
the inhibition or activation of NK cells. A restricted expression profile of KIRs
has been proposed as clonal markers of NK-cell proliferations. Here we evaluated 
the transcription profile of all KIR family genes and C-type lectin receptor
genes using RNA sequencing on NKTCL cases (n = 17) and NK-cell lines (n = 3). The
expression of all KIRs tended to be markedly reduced or absent in NKTCL, except
for the KIR family member killer Ig-like receptor 2DL4 (KIR2DL4; alias CD158D),
which was selectively overexpressed in the majority (59%) of cases. No specific
expression pattern was observed for C-type lectin receptors. KIR2DL4 is an
unusual member of the KIR family that recognizes human leukocyte antigen G and
mediates NK-cell activation through inducing proliferation and survival pathways 
such as AKT and NF-κB. Stable knockdown of KIR2DL4 in two malignant NK-cell lines
with high KIR2DL4 expression significantly reduced cell growth. Selective
overexpression of KIR2DL4 and down-regulation of inhibitory KIRs may contribute
to NKTCL pathogenesis.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare atypical parkinsonian disorder
characterized by a rapidly progressing clinical course and at present without any
efficient therapy. Neuropathologically, myelin loss and neurodegeneration are
associated with α-synuclein accumulation in oligodendrocytes, but underlying
pathomechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the impact of
oligodendrocytic α-synuclein on the formation of myelin sheaths to define a
potential interventional target for MSA. Post-mortem analyses of MSA patients and
controls were performed to quantify myelin and oligodendrocyte numbers. As
pre-clinical models, we used transgenic MSA mice, a myelinating stem cell-derived
oligodendrocyte-neuron co-culture, and primary oligodendrocytes to determine
functional consequences of oligodendrocytic α-synuclein overexpression on
myelination. We detected myelin loss accompanied by preserved or even increased
numbers of oligodendrocytes in post-mortem MSA brains or transgenic mouse
forebrains, respectively, indicating an oligodendrocytic dysfunction in myelin
formation. Corroborating this observation, overexpression of α-synuclein in
primary and stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes severely impaired myelin
formation, defining a novel α-synuclein-linked pathomechanism in MSA. We used the
pro-myelinating activity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
benztropine to analyze the reversibility of the myelination deficit.
Transcriptome profiling of primary pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes demonstrated 
that benztropine readjusts myelination-related processes such as cholesterol and 
membrane biogenesis, being compromised by oligodendrocytic α-synuclein.
Additionally, benztropine restored the α-synuclein-induced myelination deficit of
stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes. Strikingly, benztropine also ameliorated the 
myelin deficit in transgenic MSA mice, resulting in a prevention of neuronal cell
loss. In conclusion, this study defines the α-synuclein-induced myelination
deficit as a novel and crucial pathomechanism in MSA. Importantly, the reversible
nature of this oligodendrocytic dysfunction opens a novel avenue for an
intervention in MSA.

Colchicine-Induced Rhabdomyolysis: An Autopsy Case.

Arslan MN(1), Özgün A, Daş T, Kumru D, Şam B, Koç S.

Author information: 
(1)From the Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.

Colchicine is derived from Colchicum autumnale and Gloriosa superba and is used
to treat acute gout and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Musculoskeletal
adverse effects range from myopathy to rhabdomyolysis. An 18-year-old woman, with
a 2-year history of FMF treated with colchicine, took 9 colchicine pills (4.5 mg)
to relieve severe abdominal pain. On the sixth day of hospitalization, the
patient's condition worsened, and she died. As this was a case of fatal
poisoning, a forensic autopsy was performed, and the cause of death was
determined to be complications of muscle destruction due to colchicine
intoxication with the findings of myocytolysis, positive antimyoglobin antibody
staining kidney tubules. Colchicine toxicity begins with gastrointestinal
symptoms. Multiorgan effects follow the gastrointestinal effects. Serious
outcomes of colchicine toxicity are rhabdomyolysis, bone marrow suppression, and 
disseminated intravascular coagulation. In chronic diseases that require lifelong
treatment with medications, adverse effects can arise with long periods of use.
Our patient had been treated for FMF with colchicine for 2 years but took too
many colchicine pills to relieve her severe abdominal pain. Warning patients
about the effects of high doses of drugs and providing information about their
toxic effects and what to do "in case" of overuse could be lifesaving.

Carcinoma of the breast, like other malignancies, is a genetic disease with
multiple genetic events leading to the malignant phenotype. p53 mutations are the
most common genetic events in human cancer. Inactivation of p53 can be a result
of mutation in gene sequence. One of the main structures that regulate p53
stabilization is MDM2. It suppresses p53 transcriptional activation by
recognizing transactivation domain of p53. The loss of MDM2 function on p53
regulation results in deprivation of p53 tumor suppressor ability. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP309 T->G exchange) or MDM2 amplification has been
proposed to play a role in this issue. In the present study, our aim is to
analyze p53 and MDM2 status and investigate their interactions in human sporadic 
breast carcinoma. The study groups were separated according to their molecular
classifications. In each group, histologic type of the tumor, conventional
prognostic parameters, p53, and MDM2 interactions were compared statistically.
Tumors are divided into 4 subtypes due to estrogen and progesterone receptor
status, HER-2, and Ki-67 proliferation index results. According to this
classification, 23 cases are in the luminal A, 32 cases are in the luminal B, 15 
cases are in the HER-2 positive, and 22 cases are in the triple-negative group,
with a total of 92 cases. p53 expression is low in luminal breast carcinomas than
HER-2 and triple-negative subtypes. MDM2 amplification frequency was found to be 
5.4% in total. MDM2 gene amplification does not have a significant role in breast
carcinogenesis, but other possible mechanisms may play a role in its
inactivation.

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a benign tumor with a tendency for local
recurrence. GCTB may cause lung metastases, and secondary malignant GCTB is rare.
Its histological appearance does not predict local aggressiveness and/or the
metastatic potential of the tumor. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value
of the Ki-67 proliferative index and p53 protein expression in GCTB in predicting
local recurrence, lung metastasis, and malignant transformation. We
retrospectively reviewed 42 cases of GCTB. The p53 expression was positive in 20 
cases. We used 10% as a cut-off value for p53 expression. In 10 cases, there were
local recurrences. Lung metastases were found in three cases and malignant
transformation was found in one case with classical GCTB located in the sacrum
three years following diagnosis. The Ki-67 index was higher in cases with
recurrence, but this difference was not statistically significant. Of the
recurrent cases, two had no p53 staining while eight had moderate-to-strong
staining. The staining was usually weakly positive in the non-recurrent cases. In
conclusion, we believe that p53 may be used as a marker for the biological
behavior of GCTB.

The presence of greater than or equal to 90% necrosis after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is a favorable prognostic factor in osteosarcomas. A recent study
using tissue microarrays of 40 conventional osteosarcomas showed that p16
expression independently predicted the necrotic response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated this finding using whole sections in
a larger group of osteosarcomas. Cases of 83 patients who had pretreatment
biopsies and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection were
collected from 3 reference hospital archives. Age, sex, tumor size, tumor
subtype, location, and percentage of tumor necrosis were recorded; 4-μm sections 
from pretreatment biopsies were stained for p16. More than 30% strong nuclear
staining was regarded as positive. The median age was 17 years (5-68 years), and 
male/female ratio was 2.3. The mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (2-30 cm). Tumors
were most commonly of the osteoblastic type (60%) and located at the femur (47%).
p16 positivity was seen in 66% of the patients. The median pathologic necrosis
was 65%, and 39% of the patients responded favorably (≥%90 necrosis) to
neoadjuvant therapy. In univariate analysis, p16 expression significantly
correlated with greater than or equal to 90% response (P = .022). On multivariate
analysis, p16 expression (odds ratio [OR], 7.71; P = .008), female sex (OR, 8.62;
P = .006), and smaller tumor size (OR, 0.86; P = .023) were independent
predictors of favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We confirmed the
finding that p16 expression predicts postchemotherapy necrotic response in
conventional osteosarcomas.

The melanocytic cells of the cervical epithelium are capable of forming the
complete spectrum of melanocytic lesions, from benign lentigines to melanoma.
Primary malignant melanoma of the uterine cervix is a rare neoplasm with
aggressive behavior. The absence of melanin pigment can lead to misdiagnosis as
carcinomas, sarcomas, or lymphoma. Immunohistochemical studies should be used for
confirmation. In order to consent the cervix as a primary site, exclusion of any 
other probable primary sites of melanoma is needed. Here, we present a
61-year-old female patient with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. After cervical
smear, diagnosis was confirmed by cervical punch biopsy. Diagn. Cytopathol.

INTRODUCTION: All findings of preeclampsia appear as the clinical consequences of
diffuse endothelial dysfunction. Soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer 
of apoptosis (sTWEAK) was recently introduced as a TNF related cytokine in
various inflammatory and noninflammatory disorders. sTWEAK was found to be
related to endothelial dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease. In
our study we aimed to compare sTWEAK levels in women with preeclampsia to
corresponding levels in a healthy pregnant control group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was undertaken with 33 patients with
preeclampsia and 33 normal pregnant women. The concentration of sTWEAK in serum
was calculated with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.
RESULTS: Serum creatinine, uric acid, LDH levels, and uPCR were significantly
higher in the patient group compared to the control group. sTWEAK levels were
significantly lower in preeclamptic patients (332 ± 144 pg/mL) than in control
subjects (412 ± 166 pg/mL) (p = 0.04).
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that sTWEAK is decreased in patients with
preeclampsia compared to healthy pregnant women. There is a need for further
studies to identify the role of sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and to
determine whether it can be regarded as a predictor of the development of
preeclampsia.

TERT promoter mutations (TERT-mut) have been detected in 60% to 80% of urothelial
carcinomas. A molecular urine-based screening assay for the detection of TERT-mut
is currently being pursued by our group and others. A small but significant
number of bladder carcinomas are adenocarcinoma. The current study assesses the
incidence of TERT-mut in primary adenocarcinomas of urinary bladder. A
retrospective search of our institutional pathology records identified 23
cystectomy specimens with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (2000-2014). All slides
were reviewed by a senior urologic pathologist to confirm tumor type and select a
representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block for mutational analysis.
Adequate material for DNA testing was available in 14 cases (7 enteric type and 7
not otherwise specified). TERT-mut sequencing analysis was performed using
previously described SafeSeq technique. Overall, 28.5% of primary adenocarcinoma 
harbored TERT-mut. Interestingly, 57% of nonenteric adenocarcinomas were mutation
positive, whereas none of the enteric-type tumors harbored mutations. Similar to 
urothelial carcinoma, we found a relatively higher rate of TERT-mut among
nonenteric-type adenocarcinomas further supporting the potential utility of
TERT-mut urine-based screening assay for bladder cancer.

Aggressive natural killer cell leukemia (ANKL) is a rare disease with an
extremely aggressive clinical course. The etiology of ANKL is unclear with few
genetic/epigenetic aberrations described to date. Moreover, misdiagnosis of ANKL 
is a frequent problem. Clinicopathologic characteristics of 35 retrospective
cases of ANKL were investigated with the aim of improving diagnosis and to find
the genetic/epigenetic aberrations associated with ANKL etiology. Because of the 
relatively low number of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, 
diagnosis of ANKL can be missed; therefore, it is important to perform biopsy on 
solid tissues, if necessary. We describe the pathology of ANKL in the lymph
nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and skin, with focus on diagnosis and
differentiated diagnosis. We observed young male predominance in our cohort, and 
the clinical course was more aggressive than reported previously. Low lactate
dehydrogenase (<712 IU/L), chemotherapy or L-asparaginase administration were
found to be associated with more favorable outcomes. SH2 domains of STAT5B and
STAT3 also were screened for the presence of activating mutations. Moreover, CpG 
island methylation status of HACE1, a candidate tumor-suppressor gene, was
determined in ANKL samples. We observed activating STAT5B mutations (1/5) and
hypermethylation of HACE1 (3/4) in ANKL cases, suggesting that these aberrations 
may contribute to ANKL pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Adrenomedullin (AM) is a pluripotent peptide first discovered from
human pheochromocytoma. AM expression has been shown in various cancer types
including endometrium cancer. Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein which might be
regulated by AM in hypoxic conditions. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the role of AM and Bcl-2 expressions in carcinogenesis of type-1
endometrium cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Study group consisted of 10 proliferative endometrium, 22
simple endometrial hyperplasia, 23 endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN)
and 30 Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma patients. AM and Bcl-2 expressions
were investigated by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Mean AM Allred score was 3±2.6, 5.6±1.6 and 5.7±2.5 in benign, EIN and
adenocarcinoma groups, respectively. AM expression was significantly higher in
EIN and adenocarcinoma groups than in benign endometrium group (p<0.05). Mean
Bcl-2 Allred score was 6.4±2.1, 5.2±2.6, 2.3±2 in benign endometrium, EIN and
adenocarcinoma groups, respectively. Mean Bcl-2 Allred score was similar between 
benign endometrium and EIN groups (p>0.05). However, it was significantly lower
in adenocarcinoma group (p<0.05). An inverse correlation between AM and Bcl-2
expressions was found (r: -0.4, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that AM expression increased in progression from
benign endometrium to EIN and type-1 adenocarcinoma while expression of Bcl-2
decreased in transition from EIN to carcinoma.

TERT promoter mutations (TERT-mut) are detectable in the majority of urothelial
carcinomas. The detection of TERT-mut in urine is under investigation as a
potential urine-based molecular-screening assay for bladder cancer. A small but
significant number of bladder carcinomas are pure squamous cell carcinoma. We
sought to assess the incidence of TERT-mut in squamous cell carcinoma of the
urinary bladder. A retrospective search of the institutional pathology archives
yielded 15 cystectomy specimens performed for squamous cell carcinoma
(2000-2014). Histologic slides were reviewed by a senior urologic pathologist to 
confirm the diagnosis and select a representative formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue block for mutational analysis. All cases yielded
adequate material for DNA analysis. Sequencing for TERT-mut was performed using
previously described SafeSeq technique. We detected TERT-mut in 12/15 (80%) of
bladder squamous cell carcinomas. TERT promoter mutations, commonly found in
conventional urothelial carcinoma, are also highly prevalent in urinary bladder
squamous cell carcinoma suggesting a common tumorigenesis and potential utility
as a molecular urine-based-screening assay.

PURPOSE: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin
lymphoma with marked biologic heterogeneity. MYC and BCL2 rearrangements have
been reported in a proportion of DLBCLs, where they may be associated with an
adverse clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of
MYC and BCL2 translocations in DLBCL and assess the prognostic impact in DLBCL
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated the expression patterns
of CD 10, BCL6, and MUM 1 by immunohistochemistry in 121 cases with DLBCL in
tissue microarray (TMA): 62 cases in germinal center B-cells (GCBs); and 59 cases
in activated B-cells (ABCs) of which 60 were females and 61 were males. MYC and
BCL2 rearrangements were investigated by interphase fluorescence in situ
hybridization on TMAs in 97 DLBCLs.
RESULT: MYC rearrangements were observed in 11 of 97 cases. There was no
association with other clinical features, including age, sex, and
nodal/extranodal disease. MYC rearrangement was associated with significantly
worse overall survival (P < 0.01). BCL2 rearrangements were observed in 14 of 97 
cases. There was no association with other clinical features including age and
sex. BCL2 rearrangement had a worse outcome (P < 0.01). MYC and BCL2
rearrangements were observed in 3 of 97 cases with the age of  53 (female), 53,
63 years old, respectively, died in 24, 18, and 35 months after the diagnosis.
Two cases had primary nodal and one case primary extranodal presentations. All
these patients had stage IV disease.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that C-MYC and BCL2 may contribute to aggressive
transformation, and more mechanism-based therapy should be explored. Targeted
therapies involving these rearrangements and its associated pathways may change
the fate of DLBCLs. Analysis of MYC gene rearrangement along with BCL2 is
critical in the identification of high-risk patients with poor prognosis.

Prognostic impact of epidermal growth factor receptor on clear cell renal cell
carcinoma: Does it change with different expression patterns?

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, School of Medical, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess whether epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) overexpression was a significant prognostic factor in clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) and whether its prognostic significance was affected 
by immunohistochemical expression patterns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 100 cases of CRCC
using an antibody against EGFR. Tumors were grouped by nuclear grade (NG) as
low-NG (NG1, 2) or high NG (NG3, 4), and by pathological stage as localized (pT1,
2), or locally invasive (pT3, 4). Clinical disease was grouped by clinical stage 
as early stage (stage I, II), or late stage (stage III, IV). Evaluation of the
EGFR overexpression was based on cytoplasmic (EGFR Cyt), and membranous (EGFR
Mem) staining.
RESULTS: EGFR Cyt correlated with high NG (P = 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (P
= 0.028), regional lymph node involvement (P = 0.027), metastasis (P = 0.001),
late stage (P = 0.003), cancer-specific death (P = 0.036), and was a predictor
for disease-specific survival (P = 0.012) whereas EGFR Mem correlated with only
local invasion (P = 0.021) and perirenal invasion (P = 0.009) and did not show
any correlation with cancer-specific death or disease specific survival.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EGFR overexpression is an important
prognostic factor in CRCC, and its prognostic value differs significantly with
respect to the location of EGFR immunostaining. This prognostic difference may
give direction on the management and treatment of CRCC patients.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a potentially
life-threatening complication after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 
The expression of the cardioprotective SIRT1 protein with its antioxidant
activity is increased in cardiac tissue of patients suffering from POAF. So far, 
information is lacking about the relationship between SIRT1 regulating micro RNAs
(miRs), SIRT1 protein and the occurrence of POAF.
METHODS: A total of 63 patients undergoing CABG were recruited, and biopsies were
obtained from the right atrial appendage during cannulation. Postoperative, all
patients were rhythm-monitored until discharge and randomized to POAF (n=20) or
sinus rhythm (n=43). The expression of the micro RNAs miR-199a and miR-195 was
quantified by real-time PCR. SIRT1 protein was detected by western blot analysis.
RESULTS: The relative expression of miR-199a in the POAF group was significantly 
decreased compared to the control group (0.77±0.27 vs. 1.11±0.69, P=.022)
Accordingly, SIRT 1 protein was significantly induced in tissue probes of
patients with POAF (P<.001).
CONCLUSION: Altered expression of the SIRT1 protein regulating miR-199a in human 
atrial tissue was found to be related to the occurrence of POAF, indicating its
usefulness as a biomarker for cardiac surgery management.

This study is aimed to investigate the BRAF (V600E) and TERT promoter mutation
profile of 50 pediatric papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) to refine their
clinicopathological correlates. The median age at the time of surgery was
16 years (range, 6-18). No TERT promoter mutations were identified in this
series. The BRAF (V600E) mutation was present in 15 (30 %) tumors. From
genotype-histologic variant correlation perspective, 13 of 24 classic variant
PTCs and 2 of 7 diffuse sclerosing variant PTCs were found to harbor BRAF (V600E)
mutation. One cribriform-morular variant, 3 solid variant, and 15 follicular
variant PTCs were BRAF wild type. While tumors with distant metastasis were BRAF 
wild type, two of five tumors with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) harbored BRAF
(V600E) mutation. Nine of 15 BRAF (V600E) harboring tumors had central lymph node
metastases. There was no significant correlation with BRAF (V600E) mutation and
age, gender, tumor size, ETE, central lymph node metastasis, the status of pT,
pN1a-b, and distant metastasis. An adverse correlation between BRAF (V600E)
mutation and disease-free survival (DFS) was noted in the entire cohort; however,
the predictive value of BRAF (V600E) mutation disappeared within the group of
tumors displaying classic architecture as well as classic variant PTCs. The
present cohort identifies that the classic architecture with multicentricity and 
local recurrence are correlates of BRAF (V600E) harboring pediatric PTCs. While
the small size of this cohort is one of the limitations, neither the BRAF
mutation status nor the classic tumor architecture does seem to be an independent
prognosticator of DFS in this series. Evidence also suggests that TERT promoter
mutations do not seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of pediatric PTCs.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Nigella sativa
in protection of jejunal mucosa against harmful effects of gamma radiation.
METHODS: Radiotherapy group received abdominal gamma radiation of 15Gy in
addition to physiological saline. Radiotherapy+Nigella sativa treatment group
received abdominal gamma radiation of 15Gy in addition to Nigella sativa
treatment in the amount of 400mg/kg. Radiotherapy and treatment groups were
sacrificed 3 days after the exposure to irradiation. Then, jejunum samples were
harvested for biochemical and histological assessment of mucosal injury.
RESULTS: Nigella sativa treatment was found to significantly lower elevated
tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and, to raise reduced glutathione peroxidase 
(GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in intestinal tissues samples.
Single dose 15Gy gamma-irradiation was noted to result in a marked jejunal
mucosal injury. Three days after exposure to irradiation, the villi and
Lieberkühn crypts were observed as denuded, and villous height diminished.
Concomitantly with inflammatory cell invasion, capillary congestion and
ulceration were observed in the atrophic mucosa. Nigella sativa treatment
significantly attenuated the radiation induced morphological changes in the
irradiated rat jejunal mucosa.
CONCLUSION: Nigella sativa has protective effects against radiation-induced
damage, suggesting that clinical transfer is feasible.

OBJECTIVES: Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is an uncommon
congenital abnormality of the lungs that generally presents during prenatal
period or early childhood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate clinical and
pathologic findings of the children with CPAMs who were referred to our center
between 1992 and 2011.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 19 children with CPAM, who were diagnosed and
treated at the Izmir Dr. Behçet Uz Children's Hospital between 1992 and 2011. All
of them are alive and have been still followed up by our center.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 9 boys (47.4%) and 10 girls (52.6%)
with a mean age of 3.26 (1 month - 13 years). Most newborns had respiratory
distress, while recurrent pulmonary infections were detected in older children.
Surgical treatment was performed on patients with subtypes I (n = 4; 21.1%), II
(n = 8; 42.1%), III (n = 5; 26.3%), and IV (n = 2; 10.5%). In 13 cases (63.4%),
lesions were located in the right lung and in almost all cases lesions were
confined to one lobe. A one-month- old child with type I CPAM had multiple
lesions involving two lobes and in only a newborn with type II CPAM, lesions were
located bilaterally. There was no type 0 cases in this series. All cases were
treated with lobectomy without any complication.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, a realistic comprehensive picture of CPAM in a 
central children's hospital has been provided. In addition, we want to emphasize 
that complications and unnecessary medical treatment could be reduced with early 
surgery.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that negatively regulate 
gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They have been implicated in
several fundamental biological processes including development, differentiation, 
apoptosis and stem cell maintenance. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs 
also play roles in cellular transformation and carcinogenesis by acting either as
tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Recent studies introduced MIR376 as an important 
microRNA family for cancer formation and progression. The MIR376 family is
located on human chromosome 14 and it has several members containing identical or
similar seed sequences. Biological roles of family members were studied in
different cancer settings, including gliomas, leukemia, breast and ovarian
cancers. Furthermore, two MIR376 family members, namely MIR376A and MIR376B were 
implicated in the regulation of macroautophagy (autophagy herein). Since
autophagy dysregulation underlies various diseases including cancer, it is
essential to understand the role of the MIR376 family in this context. In this
article, we summarize the miRNA-cancer connection, and review accumulating data
about the involvement of the MIR376 family in cancer biology.

We present a case of a teratoma with somatic type malignancy (TSM) in the form of
papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) within supraclavicular and retroperitoneal 
lymph node metastases of a testicular pure teratoma. Resection of both masses
revealed a teratoma without any other germ cell tumor component. A papillary
carcinoma component was also detected intermingled with the teratomatous
elements. The carcinoma cells displayed eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent
nucleoli. Groups of foamy histiocytes in the fibrovascular cores was a striking
finding that brought pRCC to mind. Immunoreactivity for CK7, PAX8, AMACR, CD10,
napsin, and vimentin along with morphologic findings confirmed renal cell
differentiation. No radiological evidence of a primary renal cell carcinoma was
found in the kidney. Consequently, pRCC arising in a teratoma was diagnosed. TSM 
is described as teratoma with a malignant component that is typically encountered
in other organs and tissues. TSM in the form of pRCC is an extremely rare entity.
Our case is the second example of a testicular germ cell tumor metastasis with a 
somatic malignancy in the form of pRCC. In conclusion, carcinomas of renal cell
differentiation should be kept in mind as a rare form of TSM, especially in
metastatic germ cell tumors.

This study investigated the impact of phosphohistone-H3 (PHH3)-assisted mitotic
count by comparing its performance with conventional mitotic count and Ki67 score
as well as the status of distant metastasis. A total of 43 surgically resected
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNET) with complete follow-up information has
been subjected to a standardized assessment with respect to mitotic count (both
conventional and PHH3-assisted) and Ki67 score. Five participants assessed
mitotic count and the time spent was recorded in both methods. All tumors were
assigned to a G1 category of mitotic rate on conventional mitotic count that
failed to identify three tumors with a G2 category of mitotic rate on PHH3.
Near-perfect and fair agreements were achieved among observers when using PHH3
and conventional method, respectively. The mean time spent to determine mitotic
count on PHH3-stained slides was significantly shorter (p < 0.001). The
performance of PHH3-assisted mitotic grade category was significant as the three 
cases with a G2 mitotic category were associated with distant metastasis
(p = 0.01). Despite its performance, the PHH3-assisted mitotic count downgraded
17 cases that were classified as G2 based on Ki67 scores in this series. The Ki67
grade category was either the same or higher than the mitotic grade category. Ten
patients developed distant metastasis. Eleven tumors exhibited vascular invasion 
characterized by intravascular tumor cells admixed with thrombus. Our results
indicate that PHH3-assisted mitotic count facilitates an accurate mitotic count
with a perfect agreement among observers. The small size of this cohort is an
important limitation of the current study, a G2 mitotic grade category based on
PHH3 immunohistochemistry was one of the correlates of panNETs with distant
metastasis. While the prognostic impact of PHH3-assisted mitotic count needs to
be clarified in larger cohorts, Ki67 scores designated higher grade category in
all cases; thus, it was the best determinant of the tumor grade. More
importantly, the presence of vascular invasion along with the Ki67 grade category
was found to be independent predictors of distant metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Selection of nodules for surgery diagnosed as Bethesda category III
[atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined
significance (AUS/FLUS) category] is important. It was aimed to define the
malignancy rates associated with and without repeat fine needle aspiration biopsy
(FNAB) and to define the contribution of repeat FNAB to triage to surgery or
observation in nodules with AUS/FLUS FNAB.
METHODS: The records of all patients with nodules who underwent FNAB and
classified by Bethesda reporting system as AUS/FLUS at their institution were
reviewed. Malignancy rates for patients with AUS/FLUS FNAB with and without
repeat FNAB were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 582 patients who were classified as AUS/FLUS on initial FNAB, 179
underwent surgery with an associated malignancy rate of 22.9% (upper boundary).
Risk of malignancy among all patients with AUS/FLUS nodules was 7% (lower
boundary). The upper and lower boundaries of the malignancy rates with and
without repeat FNAB were 38.6% and 15.6% for resected patients, and 13% and 4.6% 
for all patients, respectively. Reclassification rate with repeat FNAB was 56%.
CONCLUSION: The findings showed that repeat FNAB for initial AUS/FLUS category
was associated with a significantly increased malignancy rate compared with those
without repeat FNAB. Repeat FNAB could help selection of patients with AUS/FLUS
to triage to surgery. Therefore, repeat FNAB for nodules with AUS/FLUS on initial
FNAB was suggested.

Obesity as a leading preventable cause of death worldwide is closely linked to
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, a
potent inhibitor of plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis, is increased in many
clinical situations associated with high incidence of CVD. In the obesity-linked 
elevation of PAI-1, evidence points to TNF-α as an important regulator of PAI-1
expression in adipose tissue.BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate mediastinal 
PAI-1 and TNF-α mRNA levels in adipose tissues (AT) and compare serum levels in
obesity with and without coronary artery disease (CAD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Obese patients with (n=37) and without CAD (n=20) were
included in the study.
RESULTS: The serum levels of PAI-1 and TNF-α were significantly higher in obese
patients with CAD compared to obese patients without CAD. PAI-1 mRNA expression
was significantly increased in mediastinal adipose tissue (MAT) of obese patients
with CAD compared to those without CAD, TNF-α mRNA expressions were found to be
higher in EAT (epicardial AT), MAT and SAT (subcutaneous AT) of obese patients
with CAD.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated a close direct relationship between TNF-α and
PAI-1. PAI-1 mRNA expression strongly correlated positively with serum TNF-α in
MAT, and TNF-α expressions with PAI-1 serum levels.

The intrauterine diagnosis of micropenis is an important clue in the discernment 
of some syndromes and hormonal deficiencies. In this study, we tried to establish
reference ranges for the fetal penile length and penile width. This prospective
cross-sectional study included 179 healthy singleton male fetus pregnancies that 
were between 17 and 37 weeks of gestation. Of these pregnancies, the fetal penile
length and width were measured using trans-abdominal ultrasound. The correlation 
coefficients of gestational age with penile measurements were calculated. We
observed that as the gestational age increased both the penile length and width
increased (p < .0001, correlation coefficients R(2) = 0.854 and R(2) = 0.883;
respectively). Reference values of the penile length in the Turkish Population
were similar to previously evaluated populations including English, American and 
Israeli populations. The penile width measurement is a convenient way to diagnose
micropenis, but penile width measurement alone might miss some penile
abnormalities including chordee and hypospadias.

INTRODUCTION: Syncytins belong to the Human Endogenous Retrovirus family. The
syncytin-1 receptor, SLC1A5, and syncytin-2 receptor, MFSD2, interact with their 
respective syncytin proteins to induce syncytiotrophoblast formation. However,
there is no information about syncytins in gestational diabetic placenta.
Therefore, we studied the expression and localization of syncytins and their
receptors during normal placental development and in gestational diabetic
placenta.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and Western-blot methods were performed with
antibodies against syncytin-1, syncytin-2, SLC1A5 and MFSD2 in human first
trimester placental tissues, normal term and gestational diabetic placentas.
Syncytin-1, syncytin-2 and MFSD2 mRNA transcripts were determined by qRT-PCR in
normal and diabetic term placentas.
RESULTS: Cytoplasmic syncytin-1, syncytin-2, SLC1A5 and MFSD2 immunoreactions
were observed in the trophoblastic layers in all placental samples. Some of the
stromal cells showed strong cytoplasmic punctate staining. There were
significantly weak syncytin-2 and MFSD2 immunoreaction intensities in diabetic
placentas by ImageJ analysis, in parallel with decreased syncytin-2 and MFSD2
proteins in diabetic placentas by Western-blot. Protein expression of SLC1A5
increased dramatically in early pregnancy compared to term placenta. Syncytin-1, 
syncytin-2 and MFSD2 mRNA transcripts showed similar relative expression pattern 
by qRT-PCR.
DISCUSSION: Syncytins were localized not only in cytotrophoblast cells and the
basement membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast but also in the apical microvillous 
membrane and cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblast, and some of the stromal cells and 
endothelium. Decreased syncytin-2 and MFSD2 proteins in gestational diabetic
placentas might cause abnormal syncytiotrophoblast formation and possibly be
involved in the pathology. Therefore, our study highlights an important potential
relationship between syncytins and gestational diabetic placenta.

We analyzed Her2 amplification in breast cancers with equivocal IHC staining to
investigate the significance of percentage of Her2 immunostained tumor cells. We 
especially included the breast cancers with complete/incomplete membrane staining
at moderate intensity in less than 10% of the invasive tumor cells. Of 1804
breast cases, 180 had moderate complete/incomplete membrane Her2 immunostaining. 
According to 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline, 124 were in IHC score 2+ and 56 in 1+
category. The percentage of Her2 immunostained invasive tumor cells were
determined by visual estimation at the time of diagnosis and categorized into
three groups; <10%, 10-50%, and >50% for this review. FISH was performed by dual 
DNA probe and data of Her2/cep17 ratio, Her2/cell and Cep17/cell were recorded
applying 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria. There were 22 cases (12.2%) in >50% group, 102
(56.7%) in 10-50% group, and 56 (31.1%) in <10% group. Overall Her2 amplification
was 25.5%. Her2 was amplified in 12 (54.5%) cases in >50% group; 26 (25.4%) in
10-50% and 8 (14.3%) in <10%. Her2 amplification was more frequent in cancers
with >50% moderately immunostained cells in IHC equivocal group. However, most of
Her2 IHC equivocal breast cancers contain moderate amount (10-50%) of
immunostained cells. Relatively small but non-neglectable number (14%) of cases
in <10% group was Her2 amplified by FISH which approaches to overall incidence of
Her2 overexpression (15-20%) in all breast cancer. Breast cancers with moderate
complete/incomplete membrane Her2 IHC staining in <10% of invasive tumor cells
should be regarded as equivocal and reflex FISH should be performed in these
cases.

Faculty, Department of Forensic Medicine, Kahramanmaraş, Turkey.

AIM: The autopsy is an important step in solutions of forensic cases. The design 
and effectiveness of mortuaries are of great importance in terms of proper
conduction of death examinations and autopsies. In addition, the safety of
evidence, protection of public and staff health, and the quality of service
offered to relatives of dead people are closely related to the effectiveness of
mortuaries. The aim of this study was to determine whether mortuaries in Turkey
meet international criteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen mortuaries were included in the study. The
forensic medicine experts working in these mortuaries were given a questionnaire 
composed of questions about standards developed by the National Association of
Medical Examiners (NAME) through the website my.questbase.com.
RESULTS: Most of the mortuaries outside big cities (80%) did not have their own
facilities. All of them could not control the chain of evidence and did not have 
a separate well-ventilated autopsy room where they could keep putrefied corpses.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the mortuaries did not meet most of the NAME criteria. The
mortuaries, especially those in places other than big cities, had some
deficiencies and mishandlings. Autopsy facilities and accessory laboratories
should be enabled to meet NAME accreditation standards.

BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been stratified into low- and
high-risk according to their propensity for local recurrence. Risk factors for
recurrence include histologic subtype, anatomic location (i.e. H-zone of the
face), horizontal diameter, and patient health status.
OBJECTIVE: To assess if favorable (superficial, nodular, adenoid and trabecular) 
and unfavorable (infiltrative, morpheaform, micronodular, metatypical,
basosquamous) histopathological subtypes of BCC do correlate with anatomic
location on the face (facial high risk versus non-high risk zones).
METHODS: Histopathological specimens of all facial BCCs, which were
histopathologically diagnosed in the Pathology Department of Şişli Etfal Training
Hospital, between the years 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively studied.
Histopathological aggressive and non-aggressive subtypes as well as the presence 
of ulceration were correlated with facial high-risk (i.e. H-zone) and low risk
anatomical locations.
RESULTS: Of 184 BCC of unfavorable subtypes, 101 cases were identified in facial 
high-risk anatomical region (H-zone) compared to 83 cases at non H-zone (P =
0.553). On the other hand the ulceration rate was significantly higher for
unfavorable histological subtypes than in the favorable histopathological subtype
group (P = 0.042). Regarding anatomic site, ulceration frequency was not
significantly different for the H-versus non-high risk zones (P = 0.335).
CONCLUSIONS: A correlation of unfavorable histopathological subtype of BCC and
high-risk anatomical location (i.e. H-zone) was not observed in our study. Our
results however confirmed a significantly higher rate of ulceration in the
subgroup of aggressive histopathological BCC forms. Thus, factors other than
histopathological subtype (such as narrow excision margin related to difficult
surgical technique in H-zone, microcirculation, vasculature and host inflammatory
response) may be responsible for the high recurrence rate in facial
H-zone-located BCCs.

BACKGROUND: Lymphadenopathy (LAP) may be the first symptom of many diseases. We
aimed to investigate peripheral LAP results taken by excisional biopsy.
METHODS: Histopathological examination of 185 lymph node biopsy specimens were
evaluated between January 2009 and April 2015 in Istanbul Private Ekin Pathology 
Laboratory, retrospectively.
RESULTS: The average age of patients ranged from 1 to 86 was 41.01 ± 20.62 years.
87 of were female, 98 of male. 62 (33.5%) of excisional biopsy materials were
benign lesions and 123 (66.5%) of malignant. Benign lesions were consisted of
reactive hyperplasia, cat-scratch disease, toxoplasmosis,
necrotizing/non-necrotizing granulomatous. Of these patients, 40 had nodes with
reactive hyperplasia (15 female/25 male, mean age: 27.35 y), 14 had necrotizing
granulomatous disease (9 female/5 male, mean age: 39.86 y), 2 non-necrotizing
granulomatous disease (1 female/1 male mean age: 43 y), 4 had cat-scratch disease
(1 female/3 male mean age: 54.25 y), 1 toxoplasmosis (26 y, female), 1 Kikuchi
disease (25 y, female). In the evaluation of malign lesions; 38 were Hodgkin
lymphoma (HL) (20.5%, 17 female/21 male, mean age: 34.89 y) 77 had non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) (41.6%, 37 female/40 male, mean age: 52.26 y), 8 metastasis (4.3%,
5 female/3 male, mean age: 53.5 y). Reactive LAP observed most common in cervical
region, NHL in axillary-abdomen-inguinal-mediastinum and HL in the
supraclavicular region.
CONCLUSION: Excisional biopsy can be applied safely with minimal morbidity and
mortality and a gold standard diagnostic method for LAP. Although LAP is mostly
related with benign lesions, malignancy should be kept in mind in differential
diagnosis.

Via routinely used thyroid function tests, scintigraphy and ultrasonography
(USG), important information is obtained in the clinical and diagnostic practice 
for thyroid nodules. However, the distinction between benign and malignant
lesions cannot precisely be performed with these tests. Thyroid fine needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is considered the most reliable diagnostic method in the
differentiation between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. It has recently
been likely to perform aspiration from deeper nodules via the implemention of
FNAB along with USG. Today, in cytopathological examination of thyroid FNAB,
standardized Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) system
is used. Here, FNAB was performed in 1096 patients with thyroid nodules in the
Medical School of Selcuk University between January 2009 and July 2014. Patients 
consisted of 919 women and 177 men between 12 and 87 years of age. Evaluated via 
BSRTC, the results were classified as unsatisfactory, benign, atypia (or
follicular lesions) of undetermined significance (AUS), follicular neoplasm or
lesions suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN), suspected malignant and
malignant. After FNAB, 183 patients were operated and evaluated
histopathologically. Histological malignancy rates of the categories were as
follows: 16% (5), 15% (6) 14% (1) 60% (9), 72% (18) and 97% (63), respectively.
In our study, we aimed to compare FNAB results of thyroid nodules with
histopathology results after thyroidectomy and to show the sensitivity and
specificity of FNAB technique to be higher in the follow-up and diagnosis of
thyroid lesions. Given the malignancy detection rate in the follow-up of patients
whose cytology was reported as inadequate, we also consider follow-ups are
important in these patients.

Microinvasion is the smallest morphologically identifiable stage of invasion. Its
presence and distinction from in situ carcinoma may have therapeutic
implications, and clinical staging also requires the recognition of this
phenomenon. Microinvasion is established on the basis of several morphological
criteria, which may be difficult and not perfectly reproducible among
pathologists. The aim of this study was to assess the consistency of diagnosing
microinvasion in the breast on traditional haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained
slides and to evaluate whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) for myoepithelial
markers could improve this. Digital images were generated from representative
areas of 50 cases stained with HE and IHC for myoepithelial markers. Cases were
specifically selected from the spectrum of in situ to microinvasive cancers.
Twenty-eight dedicated breast pathologists assessed these cases at different
magnifications through a web-based platform in two rounds: first HE only and
after a washout period by both HE and IHC. Consistency in the recognition of
microinvasion significantly improved with the use of IHC. Concordance rates
increased from 0.85 to 0.96, kappa from 0.5 to 0.85, the number of cases with
100% agreement rose from 9/50 to 25/50 with IHC and the certainty of diagnosis
also increased. The use of IHC markedly improves the consistency of identifying
microinvasion. This corroborates previous recommendations to use IHC for
myoepithelial markers to clarify cases where uncertainty exists about the
presence of microinvasion. Microinvasive carcinoma is a rare entity, and seeking 
a second opinion may avoid overdiagnosis.

AIMS: Before the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the presence of bone
marrow fibrosis (MF) in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has been
established as a poor prognostic factor. The aim of the present study was to
evaluate the effects of imatinib treatment on MF and the prognostic significance 
of MF at this new era of CML therapy.
METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 135 patients with CML who were exposed to 
imatinib. The grades of MF pre and post imatinib together with cytogenetic and
molecular responses were evaluated.
RESULTS: Severe MF (grade II-III) was observed in 44 (33%) patients prior to
imatinib therapy, and in 8 (8%) after 12 months of imatinib treatment (p=0.001). 
The complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates at 12 months did not differ
according to the pre-imatinib MF grades, and CCyR rates in patients with grades
0, I, II and III MF were 36/47 (76.5%), 26/33 (78.7%), 12/23 (52.1%) and 7/10
(70%), respectively (p=0.127). There was no significant difference between
patients with or without CCyR at 12 months of imatinib regarding grades of MF
(p=0.785). The distribution of the major molecular response rates at 18 months
according to pre-treatment grades of MF were determined as grade 0 in 38/45
(84.4%), grade I in 21/28 (75%), grade II in 14/21 (66.6%) and grade III in 7/10 
(70%) (p=0.112). There was no significant difference in overall survival rates
between initial MF mild (grade 0-I) and severe (grade II-III) groups (p=0.278).
CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, MF regresses with imatinib therapy over
time, and the MF grades at diagnosis do not have a negative impact on the
responses to imatinib treatment. Therefore, the adverse prognostic impact of the 
MF among patients with CML seems to disappear in the era of the TKIs.

Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death. Both
morphologically and immunohistochemically, metastatic mucinous tumors are the
best mimickers of mucinous ovarian tumors; its pathogenesis still remains a
mystery. PAX2 and PAX8 immunohisyochemistries are useful for differentiating
numerous primary tumour types from metastatic ones. There are few studies in
literature about PAX expressions in mucinous and seromucinous tumors. None of
these are takes into account the histologic type (whether it is seromucinous or
mucinous) or the metastatic origin. With this purpose hematoxylin and eosine
slides of ovarian mucinous and seromucinous tumors were re-evaluated and one
block was chosen for each case. The study included 76 ovarian mucinous and
seromucinous tumors of the ovary reported in Hacettepe University department of
pathology between 2000 and 2013. Tissue microarray (TMA) was designed from the
chosen blocks, PAX2, PAX8, CDX2 immunostains was preformed to the TMA slides. As 
a result, most of the metastatic cases were negative for PAX2 (91.2 %) and PAX8
(86.3 %), many were diffusely and strongly positive for CDX2 (68.2 %).
Seromucinous tumors were devoid of CDX2 expression; but all cases (except one)
displayed strong and diffuse positivity with PAX8. In other words differing from 
mucinous tumors, seromucinous tumors show strong PAX8 positivity-similar to
serous tumors. This study shows that PAX8 and CDX2 could be useful in
differentiating primary mucinous from metastatic tumor. Furthermore unlike the
homogeneity in seromucinous tumors for PAX8 and CDX2 mucinous tumors shows
heterogeneity with different expression patterns.

SNP Variation in MicroRNA Biogenesis Pathway Genes as a New Innovation Strategy
for Alzheimer Disease Diagnostics: A Study of 10 Candidate Genes in an
Understudied Population From the Eastern Mediterranean.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common complex neurodegenerative disorder accounting 
for nearly 50% to 70% of dementias worldwide. Yet the current diagnostic options 
for AD are limited. New diagnostic innovation strategies focusing on novel
molecules and pathways are sorely needed. In this connection, microRNAs (miRNAs) 
are conserved small noncoding RNAs that regulate posttranscriptional gene
expression and are vital for neuronal development and its functional
sustainability. Conceivably, biological pathways responsible for the biogenesis
of miRNAs represent a veritable set of upstream candidate genes that can be
potentially associated with the AD pathophysiology. Notably, whereas functional
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA biogenesis pathway genes have
been studied in other complex diseases, surprisingly, virtually no such study has
been conducted on their relevance in AD. Moreover, novel diagnostics identified
in easily accessible peripheral tissues such as the whole blood samples represent
the initial entry or gateway points on the biomarker discovery critical path for 
AD. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first association study of
functional SNPs, as measured by real-time PCR in 10 "upstream" candidate genes
critically situated on the miRNA biogenesis pathway, in a large sample of AD
patients (N=172) and healthy controls (N=109) in a hitherto understudied world
population from the Mersin region of the Eastern Mediterranean. We observed a
significant association between 2 candidate genes and AD, TARBP2 rs784567
genotype and AD (χ=6.292, P=0.043), and a trend for RNASEN rs10719 genotype
(χ=4.528, P=0.104) and allele (P=0.035). Functional SNP variations in the other 8
candidate genes (DGCR8, XPO5, RAN, DICER1, AGO1, AGO2, GEMIN3, and GEMIN4) did
not associate with AD in our sample. Given the putative biological importance of 
miRNA biogenesis pathways, these emerging data can provide a new foundation to
stimulate future debate and genetic investigations of AD, focusing on new
molecular mechanisms such as miRNA biogenesis, particularly in accessible
peripheral tissues for novel molecular diagnostics for dementia.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of melatonin on
ionized radiation-induced salivary gland damage using an experimental model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomized into four groups: (i) the 
control group (C, n = 8) that received intraperitoneal (i.p.) 0.9% NaCl; (ii) the
melatonin group (M, n = 8) that received i.p. 5 mg/kg melatonin; (iii) the
radiotherapy group (RT, n = 8) that underwent irradiation; (iv) the melatonin
plus radiotherapy group (M+RT, n = 8) that received i.p. 5 mg/kg of melatonin,
followed by irradiation 30 min later; and (v) the radiotherapy plus melatonin
group (RT+M, n = 8) that received irradiation followed by i.p. 5 mg/kg of
melatonin 30 min later. The medications and irradiation were administered for 5
days and the salivary glands of the rats were excised 10 days later; the
histopathological changes in the salivary glands were assessed and biochemical
analyses were conducted (tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced
glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS),
and oxidative stress index (OSI)).
RESULTS: Regardless of whether melatonin was administered before or after
radiotherapy, melatonin decreased the radiation-induced parotid and submandibular
histological damage. In addition, regardless of whether administration occurred
before or after radiotherapy, melatonin decreased oxidative stress markers, such 
as MDA, TOS, and OSI. On the contrary, levels of antioxidative markers, such as
CAT and GPx, were increased by melatonin.
CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin may have a significant protective effect on salivary gland
damage secondary to ionizing radiation.

The study investigated immunoexpression of amyloid A (AA) in clear cell renal
cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and evaluated its clinicopathologic correlation,
particularly in disease progression. Expression of AA protein was evaluated in
patients with CCRCC by immunohistochemistry. 146 cancerous tissue samples from 86
male and 60 female patients were studied. The relationship between AA protein
expression and TNM stage, nuclear grade, renal capsule invasion, perirenal
invasion, and survival of the patients were assessed. Thirty four percent of
CCRCC cases were AA positive. The positive AA immunoexpression was related to
higher Fuhrman nuclear grade, presence of perirenal invasion of the tumor, and
poor survival of patients with CCRCC. There was not any statistically significant
difference between patients' gender, status of capsule invasion, and stages of
the tumor in terms of AA immunoexpression. Tumor stage (Hazard ratio (HR) = 7.76 
(95% CI: 2.43-24.8) for stage 3 and HR = 29.9 (95% CI: 6.97-128.32) for stage 4) 
and AA immunoexpression (HR = 2.16 (95% CI: 1.01-4.64) were found to be
associated with survival of the patients with CCRCC in Cox regression analysis.
Immunoexpression of AA was increased in high grade CCRCCs. Immunoexpression of AA
was associated with poor survival in patients with CCRCC. Thus, AA staining might
be used as a useful immunohistological marker for the prediction of poor
prognosis in renal cell cancer.

OBJECTIVE: The International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason grading
system was modified in 2005. Since the modified system was introduced, many
cancers that previously would have been categorized as Gleason score (GS) 6 are
now categorized as GS 7 based on biopsy specimens that only contain minimal
amounts (<6%) of Gleason pattern (GP) 4 tissue. However, the clinical
significance of observing <6% of GP 4 tissue in biopsies of GS 7 prostate cancer 
has not been studied.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was based on needle biopsy specimens that were
categorized as GS 6 or GS 7 and were obtained from patients who underwent radical
prostatectomy (RP) with available follow-up data. We assessed the quantity of GP 
4 tissue in biopsy specimens of GS 7 prostate cancer. Further, we evaluated the
correlation between the quantity of GP 4 tissue and disease progression after RP.
RESULTS: GP 4 comprising 26-49% of the specimen, GS 4+3 and percentage of total
core tissue scored as positive were significant and independent predictors of
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after RP, as assessed using a
multivariate Cox regression model that included the quantity of GP 4 in the
prostate biopsy specimen, preoperative PSA, perineural invasion, clinical stage, 
number of positive cores, and percentage of core tissue scored as positive. Cases
with GS 3+3 and cases in which the observed GP 4 area was <6% did not differ
significantly in terms of biochemical PSA recurrence (BPR) status. In contrast,
cases with 6-25% GP 4 tissue, 26-49% GP 4 tissue, and GS 4+3 showed more frequent
BPR than cases with GS 3+3.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the quantity of GP 4 tissue in GS 7 cancer has
clinical significance. However, there is a need for larger studies of the
clinical significance of biopsy specimens that include <6% GP 4 tissue. We should
reconsider whether the amount of GP 4 should be included in standart pathology
reports.

We investigated whether Notch signaling was increased in an experimental liver
fibrosis model and examined the effects of resveratrol on Notch expression. Rats 
were divided into four groups: the control group, injected with physiological
saline; the CCl₄ group; the CCl₄ plus resveratrol group; and the resveratrol
group. After treatment, immunostaining was performed to detect Notch1, Notch3,
Notch4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA),
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), and TUNEL assays were performed to evaluate apoptosis. Sirius red
staining was used to detect fibrosis. Samples were also biochemically evaluated
for glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), lipid
peroxidation, and protein oxidation. GSH, GPx, and catalase activities were
significantly decreased (p⟨0.001) in the CCl₄ group. Distinct collagen
accumulation was detected around the central vein and portal areas, and numbers
of Notch1-, Notch3-, and Notch4-positive cells were significantly increased
(p⟨0.001) in fibrotic areas in the CCl₄ group. Increased expression of Notch
proteins in fibrotic areas may support the role of Notch in mediating signaling
associated with liver fibrosis through activation of hepatic stellate and
progenitor cells. In contrast, resveratrol prevented liver fibrosis by decreasing
lipid peroxidation and may be effective for inhibiting Notch signaling.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is an important cause of adult mortality and morbidity;
however its pathogenesis is still unknown. Several studies have examined to
determine the role of genetic polymorphism of proinflammatory cytokines in the
occurence of stroke. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship
between three polymorphisms; including tumour necrosis alpha (TNFα)-238 GA,
interleukin( IL-10)-1028 GA (rs1800896), IL-6-(rs1800795) and ischemic stroke in 
a Turkish population.
METHODS: Forty two stroke patients and 48 healhty controls were genotyped using
PCR analysis for TNFα-238 G/A, IL-10-1028 GA and IL-6-rs1800795 AG polymorphisms.
RESULTS: The frequency of the CC and CG, GG genotype of IL-6 gene (rs1800795)
were statiscially significiantly higher in IS patients than controls (for C/C
genotype, P=0.03, OR=4.3; 95% CI: 1.13 to 16.29 and for C/G genotype, P=0.04,
OR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.03 to 12.95, for G/G genotype, P=0.02, OR=0.25; 95% CI:
0.07-0.85 respectively).
CONCLUSION: Il-6 CC genotyped was found strongly associated with ischemic stroke 
than other two polymorpisms TNF-α and IL-10 in our population.

BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicated that incidence of thyroid carcinoma is
increasing throughout the worldwide. The aim of our study was to determine a
possible relationship between Forkhead box E1 (FOXE1) gene variants and
histopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
METHODS: FOXE1 gene variations; rs894673, rs1867277 and rs3758249 were analyzed
in 57 Papillary thyroid carcinoma patients and 51 age matched healthy control
subjects. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique was used to
specifically detect the variations.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the distribution of rs894673
genotypes in Papillary thyroid carcinoma cases (P=0.01). AA genotype presence of 
rs1867277 was more significantly associated with several histopathological
parameters such as focal and diffuse capsular invasion, lymphatic invasion, P3
with P4 tumor grade and surgical margins. AA genotype presence in rs1867277
variation was significantly associated with the classical variant which is
subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the presence of the allel A 
was found to be related with lymph node invasion risk by 2.46 fold, capsular
invasion risk by 2.97 fold, and pT3 with pT4 pathological stage risk by 4.13 fold
and the presence of allele A in rs1867277 was significantly associated with
classic variants. The presence of allele A in rs1867277 was more significantly
associated with several histopathological parameters in classic variant in
papillary thyroid carcinoma cases such as, the presence of the A allele was found
relationship with lymph node invasion risk by 2.0 fold, capsular invasion risk by
2.39 fold , and pT3 with pT4 pathological stage risk by 3.57 fold. In addition,
AATT, AAAA and GATT haplotypes (rs1867277 and rs894673) were evaluated for
association with papillary thyroid carcinoma cases. Our results indicate that the
significant difference according to two-allele haplotype distribution between
papillary thyroid carcinoma cases and control groups.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that FOXE1 variations generate a higher risk for
poor histopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Paraquat (PQ) is an agrochemical agent commonly used worldwide, which can cause
acute lung injury (ALI) and death. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) is a
therapeutic method, but the mechanisms of the protective effect of HBOT on ALI
remain elusive. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of HBOT on
acute lung injury induced by PQ in rats. Wistar Albino rats (n=21) were separated
into three groups of seven animals each: control (C), PQ, and PQ + HBOT groups.
20 mg/kg PQ was administered intraperitoneally in PQ and PQ + HBOT groups to
induce experimental lung injury. Three days after PQ treatment, PQ + HBOT group
was administered 100% O2 at 2.0 ATA for 1 hour per day, for five consecutive
days. At the end of the study, lung tissue was obtained for determining total
oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), oxidative stress index
(OSI) and histopathological determination. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
interleukin 6 (IL-6), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-β1 mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) level in the plasma was determined. Plasma iNOS, OSI, tissue
TNF-α, TGF-β1 and bFGF mRNA levels, and histological injury scores in PQ + HBOT
group were significantly lower than PQ group. TAS level in PQ + HBOT group was
significantly higher than PQ group. The findings suggest that HBOT could
effectively ameliorate PQ-induced lung injury in rats.

Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical condition which results from oxygen deprivation 
of the fetus or newborn and the breakdown of perfusion in various organs. The aim
of this study was to evaluate and compare troponin T levels over time as a marker
of cardiac injury in cases of perinatal asphyxia and healthy newborns. The study 
included a total of 30 newborns diagnosed with perinatal asphyxia with a
gestational age of 32-41 weeks, based on the last menstruation date, and 30
healthy newborns with a gestational age of 34-40 weeks, as the control group.
Levels of troponin T and creatinin kinase MB were recorded for all participants. 
No difference was determined between the groups in terms of gestational age,
manner of birth, electrocardiographic findings, and PaO2 and PaCO2 values. The
umbilical artery pH levels and bicarbonate levels in the study group were found
to be statistically lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). The
troponin T and creatinin kinase MB levels in the patients in the study group were
higher than those within the control group, at all times. The periods when
specificity and sensitivity were highest together for troponin T were the 12th
and 24th h. Specificity for troponin T reached the highest value at the 24th h
and sensitivity reached the highest value in the cord blood. A positive
correlation was found between the troponin T and creatinin kinase MB values at
the 6th and 12th h. However, no correlation could be found in the blood between
the serum troponin T and creatinin kinase MB levels at the 3rd and 24th h. The
troponin T level is a useful test for showing cardiac damage in hypoxic patients 
in the neonatal period. The sensitivity and specificity of cardiac specific
troponin T levels in detecting cardiac damage are much higher according to
telecardiography and electrocardiography, while the implementation of the method 
is simple.

AIMS: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is an uncommon malignant tumor of the 
pancreas with a favorable prognosis unlike other pancreatic neoplasms. We
investigated the clinicopathological features of 20 patients with SPN in details.
METHODS: The patients diagnosed as SPN in Dokuz Eylul University Hospital between
January 2005 and March 2016 were reviewed in terms of clinical and
histopathological data.
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 33. Three of our cases were male and 4 were
children. Some patients had synchronuous malignancies. Nine patients were
diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). One of our tumors had 2×1mm 
of pancreas endocrine neoplasm in addition to SPN. One case had foci of atypical 
and multinucleated giant cells. All cases were positive for vimentin and CD10
antibodies and most were positive for PR and β-catenin. The mean follow-up
duration was 40 mo (range 2-110 mo). Only one case showed liver metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Herein we present a series of 20 patients with 3 male and 4 pediatric
cases, almost half of which were diagnosed with FNAC findings, and most of which 
are clinically being followed with one patient showing progression. Our series
includes rare examples like collision tumor of SPN and pancreas endocrine
neoplasm, SPN with multinucleated giant cells. Also cases with no surgical
treatment and no progression, as well as cases with synchronous malignancies are 
presented. We believe that FNAC findings of any pancreatic mass should be
investigated in detail for the designation of a therapy plan especially for the
patients with high operation risks. The findings in our series also show that
extensive necrosis, angioinvasion, perineurial invasion and larger tumor size
might be predictive for worse prognosis and these patients should be more closely
followed up.

The current therapeutic approach to patients with locally advanced rectal cancer 
is neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal
excision. We aimed to investigate the number, size, and distribution of
metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes within the mesorectum; whether
neoadjuvant therapy has any impact on the number and size of the lymph nodes; and
the impact of metastatic lymph node localization on overall and disease-free
survival. Specimens from 50 consecutive patients with stage II/III rectal cancer 
receiving either neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were investigated.
Lymph node dissection was carried out by careful visual inspection and palpation.
The localization of the each lymph node within the mesorectum and the relation
with the tumor site were noted. The size and the number of lymph nodes retrieved 
decreased significantly with neoadjuvant therapy. Majority of the metastatic and 
nonmetastatic lymph nodes were located at or proximally to the tumor level and
posterior side of the mesorectum. No relation was observed between the overall
and disease-free survival, and the localization of the metastatic lymph nodes.
Presence of lymph node metastases proximal to the tumor level has no impact on
survival compared with the presence of lymph node metastasis only in the
peritumoral region of the mesorectum. Although neoadjuvant therapy decreases the 
size and the number of lymph nodes, reaching an ideal number of lymph nodes for
accurate staging is still possible with careful naked eye examination and
dissection of perirectal fat. As the majority of metastatic and nonmetastatic
lymph nodes are located in peritumoral and proximal compartment, and posterior
side of the mesorectum, these regions should be the major interest of dissection.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of E-cadherin, p53, and
inhibin-α immunostaining in the differential diagnosis of hydropic abortion (HA),
partial hydatidiform mole (PHM), and complete hydatidiform mole (CHM).
E-cadherin, p53, and inhibin-α protein expression patterns were investigated
immunohistochemically using paraffin -embedded tissue sections from
histologically diagnosed cases of HA (n = 23), PHM (n = 24), and CHM (n = 23).
Expression patterns of these markers were scored semi-quantitatively according to
the staining intensity, percentage of positive cells, and immunoreactivity score.
Classification of cases was established on histologic criteria and supported by
the molecular genotyping. Immunostaining allowed the identification of specific
cell types with E-cadherin, p53, and inhibin-α expression in all cases.
E-cadherin expression was detected on the cell surface of villous
cytotrophoblasts. We observed a marked decline in the expression of E-cadherin
from HAs to PHMs to CHMs. The p53-positive reaction was restricted to the nucleus
of villous cytotrophoblasts. Significantly increased p53 expression was observed 
in CHMs, compared with HAs and PHMs. The expression of inhibin-α was localised in
the cytoplasm of villous syncytiotrophoblasts, and the expression of this marker 
was significantly higher in PHMs and CHMs than HAs. In conclusion,
immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin, p53, and inhibin-α expression could
serve as a useful adjunct to conventional methods in the differential diagnosis
of HA, PHM, and CHM.

Autophagy and apoptosis are two important molecular mechanisms that maintain
cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. Autophagy represents an
intracellular mechanism responsible for turnover of organelles and long-lived
proteins through a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway. Cell death signals or 
sustained stress might trigger programmed cell death pathways, and among them,
apoptosis is the most extensively studied one. Recent studies indicate the
presence of a complex interplay between autophagy and apoptosis. Physiological
relevance of autophagy-apoptosis crosstalk was mainly shown in vitro. However, in
vivo consequences possibly exist both during health and disease. In this review, 
we will summarize the current knowledge about molecular mechanisms connecting
autophagy and apoptosis, and about the significance of this crosstalk for human
health.

This paper reviewed possible health effects from exposure to low levels of
electromagnetic field (EMF) in children, arising from electrical power sources
and mobile phones. Overall, the information about effects on developmental
processes and cognitive functions is insufficient and further research on
children and adolescents is critically needed. New research approaches are
required focused on the effects on the developmental processes of children
exposed to electromagnetic fields, using consistent protocols. When the current
data were considered in detail, it was noted that children's unique
vulnerabilities make them more sensitive to EMFs emitted by electronics and
wireless devices, as compared to adults. Some experimental research shows a
neurological impact and exposure in humans may lead to the cognitive and
behavioral impairments. Because of the proliferation of wireless devices, public 
awareness of these dangers now is important to safeguard children's future
healthy brain development.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate prolidase activity and oxidative
stress in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and oral lichenoid contact
reactions (OLCR) using serum and salivary samples and to compare these biomarkers
with each other as well as with a group of healthy subjects in order to be able
to opine their role in the estimation of OLP and OLCR.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen recently diagnosed patients with OLP, 32 patients 
with OLCR and 18 healthy controls with matched periodontal status were recruited 
to the study. Prolidase activity, lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde
(MDA), sialic acid (SA), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) levels
in both serum and saliva were determined. Additionally, salivary flow rate and
its buffering capacity were estimated. Statistical analyses were performed using 
the chi-square test, t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Spearman's rho correlation 
coefficient.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the study
groups and the control group regarding to the basic characteristics and the
periodontal status (P > 0.05). There were no statistically significant
differences between OLP and OLCR groups regarding to the distribution of lesions'
type, severity, and location (P > 0.05). No significant differences were found
between the two study groups with regard to Prolidase activity, MDA, SA, and
AOPPs (P ˃ 0.05), whereas statistically significant differences were found
between the two study groups and the control group with regard to all evaluated
parameters except of serum prolidase (P ˂ 0.01). Moderate correlation was found
between salivary MDA and the OLP/OLCR lesion severity, whereas a weak correlation
was observed between serum SA and the OLP/OLCR lesion severity (P ˂ 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest an increased prolidase activity
and oxidative stress and imbalance in the antioxidant defense system in
biological fluids of patients with OLP and OLCR when compared with the healthy
subjects. Both OLP and OLCR patients revealed almost similar prolidase activity
and oxidative stress levels although these two conditions have different
etiopathogenesis.

Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Head trauma takes place among the leading causes of mortality in
children. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of head trauma-related
deaths among children younger than 5 years in Istanbul, Turkey.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted using the records of the Morgue
Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Istanbul. The records of cases 
autopsied between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively investigated. Of all
preschool children deaths, 203 head trauma-related deaths were included in the
study.
RESULTS: Of all, 117 (57.6%) were males and 86 (42.4%) were females. Most cases
(107, 52.70%) were between the ages of 12 and 36 months. The most common
mechanism of injury was "fall from a height" with 97 cases (47.78%), followed by 
"traffic accidents" (67, 33%) and "hit by falling objects" (19, 9.35%). Skull
fracture was detected in 176 cases (86.69%), of which 81 (46.02%) were
characterized with linear fracture. Furthermore, skull fracture was accompanied
by 1 or more skeletal bone fracture in 64 cases. Retinal hemorrhage was
investigated in 5 cases of suspected physical abuse and only 2 of them showed
retinal hemorrhage findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Obtained findings revealed that fall from a height was the leading
cause of death among unnatural deaths in children younger than 5 years. Domestic 
accident was found to be a significant risk factor in childhood deaths. Traffic
fatalities were among leading causes of death in childhood in our country,
likewise in all around the world. Children were found to be more vulnerable to
traumas when they start to move around with incomplete motor skills. Therefore,
education of parents in terms of child supervision and installing safety
precautions toward preschool children will be helpful in preventing such
injuries. On the contrary to some findings in the literature, more severe lesions
were also prominent even in case of short-range falls from a height.

BACKGROUND: Of all human oral carcinomas, 41 % are localized to the tongue.
Despite considerable improvements in both diagnosis and treatment, tongue
squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) has remained one of the most lethal types of
cancer. Here, we aimed at identifying a salivary microRNA (miRNA) expression
signature specific for TSCC patients.
METHODS: To identify putative diagnostic biomarkers, we compared the miRNA
expression profiles of saliva samples from three TSCC patients and four healthy
control individuals using an Agilent miRNA microarray platform (V19). Three of
the differentially expressed miRNAs identified were selected for further
validation using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in saliva
samples from 25 TSCC patients and 25 healthy control individuals.
RESULTS: Through microarray-based expression profiling, we found that 419 miRNAs 
were deregulated in the saliva samples from the TSCC patients compared to those
from the healthy control individuals tested. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis revealed
that the expression level of miR-139-5p was significantly reduced in the TSCC
validation samples compared to the controls. Further analysis of post-operative
saliva samples derived from TSCC patients revealed that the miR-139-5p expression
levels had turned back to normal again. In addition, we found that miR-139-5p
exhibited enough power to discriminate pre-operative TSCC patients from both
normal individuals (AUC: 0.805) and post-operative TSCC patients (AUC: 0.713),
thereby underscoring its diagnostic potential.
CONCLUSIONS: From our results we conclude that saliva can be used as a feasible
source for routine TSCC diagnostics and that miR-139-5p may serve as a potential 
biomarker for early TSCC detection.

Review of the Literature.

Thoracic myoepithelial tumors (MTs) are a rare group of tumors showing
predominant or exclusive myoepithelial differentiation. They are poorly
characterized from both a morphologic and genetic standpoint, in particular
features that separate benign from malignant behavior. We examined the histologic
and immunohistochemical features of 8 primary thoracic MTs and performed
fluorescence in situ hybridization for EWSR1, FUS, PLAG1, and HMGA2, as well as
several partner genes. Half (4/8) of the MTs occurred in large airways, and 3 had
infiltrative borders. All cases showed immunoreactivity for epithelial markers,
in conjunction with S100 protein or myogenic markers. MTs showed morphologic
characteristics analogous to MTs at other sites, with no tumors having ductal
differentiation. Necrosis and/or lymphovascular invasion was present in 5 cases, 
with mitotic activity ranging from 0 to 6 mitoses/2 mm² (mean 1). Metastases
occurred in 2 cases, and no patients died of disease. Gene rearrangements were
identified in half of the cases, with EWSR1-PBX1, EWSR1-ZNF444, and FUS-KLF17
fusions identified in 1 case each and 1 case having EWSR1 rearrangement with no
partner identified. No cases were found to have HMGA2 or PLAG1 abnormalities.
Compared with fusion-negative tumors, fusion-positive tumors tended to occur in
patients who were younger (50 vs. 58 y), female (1:3 vs. 3:1 male:female ratio), 
and demonstrated predominantly spindle and clear cell morphology. Using a
combined data set of our case series with 16 cases from the literature, poor
prognosis was significantly correlated with metastases (P=0.003), necrosis
(P=0.027), and ≥5 mitoses/2 mm²/10 high-power field (P=0.005). In summary, we
identify a subset of thoracic MTs harboring rearrangements in EWSR1 or FUS, and
our data suggest that necrosis and increased mitotic activity correlate with
aggressive clinical behavior.

The extracellular matrix molecule periostin (POSTN, encoded by POSTN), which is
secreted by activated pancreatic stellate cells, has important functions in
chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. However, the role of POSTN in acute
pancreatitis and subsequent regeneration processes has not been addressed so far.
We analyzed the function of POSTN in pancreatic exocrine regeneration after the
induction of a severe acute pancreatitis. Postn-deficient mice and wild-type
control animals received repetitive cerulein injections, and a detailed
histologic analysis of pancreatic tissues was performed. Although there was no
difference in pancreatitis severity in the acute inflammatory phase, the recovery
of the exocrine pancreas was massively impaired in Postn-deficient mice. Loss of 
Postn expression was accompanied by strong pancreatic atrophy and
acinar-to-adipocyte differentiation, which was also reflected in gene expression 
patterns. Our data suggest that POSTN is a crucial factor for proper exocrine
lineage-specific regeneration after severe acute pancreatitis.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a major health problem characterized by compromised bone
strength. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease that progresses slowly and is
characterized by breakdown of the cartilage matrix. Alendronate (ALN), a
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (BIS), inhibits bone loss and increases bone
mineralization, and has been used clinically for the treatment of OP. It is still
controversial whether BIS is effective in inhibiting the progression of OA.
Chondrocyte apoptosis has been described in both human and experimentally induced
OA models. In our study we aimed to detect whether ALN could protect articular
cartilage from degeneration and reduce apoptosis rates in experimentally OA
induced rats. For this rats were ovariectomized (ovex), nine weeks after
operation rats were injected 30 µg/kg/week ALN subcutaneously for six weeks.
After six weeks articular cartilages were obtained. We did Safranin O staining
and Mankin and Pritzker scorings to evaluate degeneration and investigated the
expressions of p53, cleaved caspase 3, Poly ADP-ribose (PAR), Poly ADP-ribose
polymerase 1 (PARP 1), and applied TUNEL technique to determine apoptotis rates. 
We found a significant decrease in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) amount and increased
apoptosis which indicates damage on articular cartilages of ovex rats. GAG amount
was higher and apoptosis rate was lower on articular cartilages of ALN treated
ovex rats compared to the ovex group. In contrary to studies showing that early
ALN treatment has a protective effect, our study shows late ALN treatment has a
chondroprotective effect on articular cartilage since we treated rats nine weeks 
after ovariectomy.

Testicular torsion is a well-known medical emergency that can lead to
pathological changes in the testicular tissues and male infertility. This
investigation was undertaken to gain insight into the effects of an endothelin
type A receptor antagonist (BQ123) on torsion-induced germ cell loss.
Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups. In group I
(control group), a sham operation to the left testis was performed. In group II
(I/R injury), I/R injury was created by rotating the left testis 720° in a
clockwise direction for 2 h and detorsing the testis after 2 h. In group III (I/R
injury+BQ123), the rats were subjected to I/R injury and BQ123 injection (1
mg/kg, intravenous). In group IV (control+BQ123), the sham operated rats were
subjected to BQ123. The testes of the rats were removed in all groups.
Torsion-induced apoptosis and the effects of BQ123 were examined by the terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end
labelling (TUNEL) technique, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. In group 
II, the number of TUNEL-positive cells increased after testicular torsion.
Immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that apoptotic proteins (active 
caspase 3 and Bax) were upregulated, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 was
downregulated in I/R injury. The administration of BQ123 caused a significant
decrease in the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of apoptotic
proteins (p<0.05) when compared with the I/R injury group. No significant effect 
of BQ123 was observed in the testicular cells of group IV. This animal study
provides evidence of the regulatory effects of BQ123 on torsion-induced
testicular apoptosis.

Pathologists have an important role in the diagnosis of infectious disease (ID). 
In many cases, a definitive diagnosis can be made using cytopathology alone.
However, several ancillary techniques can be used on cytological material to
reach a specific diagnosis by identifying the causative agent and consequently
defining the management of the patient. This review aims to present the
effectiveness of the application of molecular studies on cytological material to 
diagnose IDs and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various
molecular techniques according to the type of cytological specimen and the
infectious agents.

Biomarkers such as mismatch repair proteins, CDX2, p53, and E-cadherin are blamed
for colon cancers, but the relationships of these biomarkers with each other and 
with pathological risk factors in colon carcinoma are still not clear. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the association of these biomarkers with each other by
using immunohistochemical staining and to compare their expression with
pathological risk factors for colonic adenocarcinoma. We also aimed to study the 
usability of a double panel of mismatch repair proteins. One hundred and eleven
cases with colonic adenocarcinoma were examined. There was a statistically
significant relationship between tumor histological differentiation and
perineural invasion, vascular invasion, mismatch repair deficiency, p53, CDX2,
and E-cadherin (p < 0.05). PMS2 and MSH6 loss covered 100% of cases with mismatch
repair deficiency. Mismatch repair deficiency was correlated with CDX2 loss and
E-cadherin expression (p < 0.05). It was also observed that cases with PMS2 loss 
covered all the cases with CDX2 loss. In conclusion, this double panel may be
used instead of a quadruple panel for detecting mismatch repair deficiency.
Association of CDX2 and PMS2 in the present study is necessary to conduct further
genetic and pathological studies focusing on these two markers together.

Oral bacteria in pancreatic cancer: mutagenesis of the p53 tumour suppressor
gene.

Öğrendik M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Division Physical Therapy and Rheumatology, Selcuk State Hospital Selcuk,
Turkey.

Carcinoma of exocrine pancreas is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths,
worldwide. The prevalence of this disease is very high in patients with chronic
pancreatitis. Orodigestive cancers are frequently seen in patients with
periodontitis. These findings suggest that this type of cancer may have some
bacterial origins. This study hypothesizes that the peptidyl arginine deaminase
(PAD) enzymes found in oral bacteria may be responsible for the p53 point
mutations that occur in patients with pancreatic cancer. Porphyromonas
gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola 
possess the PAD enzyme, and p53 arginine mutations have been detected in patients
with pancreatic cancer. Moreover, the Pro allele p53Arg72-Pro is a risk factor
for the development of this cancer. Anti-P. gingivalis antibody titers have been 
found to be higher in patients with pancreatic cancer as compared to healthy
controls. The hypothesis in question can be tested if the DNA of P. gingivalis or
the antibodies against P. gingivalis can be detected in patients with the p53
arginine mutation.If this hypothesis is true, it could reveal the real cause of
pancreatic cancer, which is a fatal disease. Further studies are necessary in
order to confirm this hypothesis.

BACKGROUND: Although primary bone tumors are relatively uncommon, they constitute
the most important tumors in patients less than 20 years. We aimed to determine
the frequencies of primary bone tumors and tumor-like lesions of bone and the
anatomical sites of their occurrence.
METHODS: A retrospective review of histopathology reports of all bone specimens
received in a private pathology laboratory in Istanbul between 2009 and 2015.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (aged 5 to 18 years) with a mean of 13.12 years
were studied. Thirty five patients (61.4%) were males and 22 (38.6%) were
females. Fifty five (94.4%) of the tumors were benign. Osteochondroma was the
commonest tumor accounting for 31 cases (54.3%) followed by osteoid osteoma, 9
cases (15.7%). Chondrosarcoma observed in two patients and Ewing sarcoma in one
patient as malignant tumors. Of the 57 bone tumors 13 (22.8%) occurred in the
upper extremities, while 44 (77.2%) were in the lower extremities. Proximal
humerus was the most commonly involved site in upper extremity tumors, with
osteochondromas representing the most frequent type of tumor (4 patients; 7%). In
the lower extremities again osteochondromas were the most common type of tumor (8
cases, 14%), with the femur being the most common site of involvement (18
patients, 31.5%). Of the patients with tumor-like lesions; four patients had
fibrous dysplasia, 4 patients had non-ossified fibromas, 4 patients had simple
bone cysts and 3 had aneurismal bone cyst.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that primary bone tumors were mainly benign,
settled predominantly in the lower extremities mostly in the femur with a male
preponderance. Osteochondroma was the most common benign bone tumor. We didn't
observed osteosarcoma, which is the most frequent malignant bone tumor.

Ki-67 and caspase indices are two very important prognostic variables for breast 
cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the immunoexpressions of these two
prognostic variables at the center, the periphery of the tumor in comparison with
each other, and additional parameters in 53 breast cancer specimens. It has been 
shown that the increase of caspase immunoexpression either at the periphery or
the center of the tumor correlated with the increase of Ki-67 immunoexpression at
the same areas. There was no statistically significant difference between caspase
and Ki-67 immunoexpression at the center or the periphery of the tumor. No
statistically significant correlation was found between immunoexpressions of
caspase and Ki-67 with the tumor grade, stage, lymph node metastasis,
lymphovascular or perineural invasion. The two very important prognostic
variables of breast cancer (caspase and Ki-67) were evenly distributed in the
center and the periphery of the tumor. It is evident that there is no need for a 
specific locational sampling when these two variables are considered. In
accordance with this information, the differences in sampling due to observer
diversity may be prevented.

We investigated the effect of clinical features and well-known histomorphological
parameters on survival of breast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 44 patients with
invasive ductal carcinoma were included in this study. We investigated the effect
of age, breast cancer location (right/left), histological grade, largest diameter
of the tumor, lymphovascular and perineural invasion on patient survival. IBM
SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 20 program was used for
statistics. Cox proportional hazard regression model for survival analysis,
log-log plot, life function graphs were used. Results were 95% confidence
interval, significance (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the left breast localization, high histological 
grade, large tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion has been
shown that reduced the overall survival (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis,
only high histological grade, large tumor size and perineural invasion were
identified as parameters negatively associated with patient survival (P < 0.05). 
On univariate and multivariate analysis, age was not associated with survival.
CONCLUSION: The above results should be considered in the follow-up and treatment
planning of invasive ductal carcinoma patients.

AIM: Non-small cell lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer related to
death in the world. Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC) is the second most
frequent histological subtype of lung carcinomas. Recently, growth factors,
growth factor receptors, and signal transduction system-related gene
amplifications and mutations are extensively under investigation to estimate the 
prognosis and to develop individualized therapies in SqCLC. In this study,
besides the signal transduction molecule phosphatidyl inositol-3-phosphate kinase
(IP3K) p110α, we explored the expressions of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)
and receptor-1 (FGFR1) in tumor tissue and also their clinical and prognostic
significance in patients with early/advanced SqCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2013, 129 patients (23 early, 106 advanced
disease) with a histopathological SqCLC diagnosis were selected from the hospital
files of Cukurova University Medical Faculty for this study. Two independent
pathologists evaluated FGFR1, FGF2, and PI3K (p110α) expressions in both tumor
and stromal tissues from 99 of the patients with sufficient tissue samples, using
immunohistochemistry. Considering survival analysis separately for patients with 
both early and advanced stage diseases, the relationship between the clinical
features of the patients and expressions were evaluated by univariate and
multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: FGFR1 expression was found to be low in 59 (60%) patients and high in 40
(40%) patients. For FGF2; 12 (12%) patients had high, 87 (88%) patients had low
expression and for IP3K; 31 (32%) patients had high and 66 (68%) patients had low
expressions. In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was significantly
associated with stage of the disease and the performance status of the patient
(P<0.0001 and P<0.001). There was no significant difference in OS of the patients
with either low or high expressions of FGFR1, FGF2, and IP3K. When the patients
with early or advanced stage disease were separately taken into consideration,
the relationship did not differ, either. Any of FGFR1, FGF2 or IP3K expressions
was not found predictive for the treatment of early or advanced staged patients. 
On the other hand, the expressions of both FGFR1 and FGF2 were significantly
different with respect to smoking, scar of tuberculosis and scar of radiotherapy 
(P=0.002; P=0.06 and P=0.05, respectively).
DISCUSSION: There has not been identified an effective individualized treatment
for SqCLC yet. Therefore, in order to be able to develop such a treatment in the 
future, it is essential to identify the genetic abnormalities that are
responsible for the biological behaviors and carcinogenesis of SqCLC. Although we
could not show the prognostic and predictive significance of FGFR1, FGF2 and IP3K
expressions in SqCLC, we determined the expression rates of FGFR1, FGF2 and IP3K 
as a reference for Turkish patients. In conclusion, we want to put some emphasis 
on the fact that, pulmonary fibrosis which is a late complication of radiotherapy
at stage III disease, and the scar of tuberculosis could be associated with FGFR1
and FGF2 expressions.

The intercellular bridges are essential structures in maintaining the histologic 
organization of the epithelium, while providing a very efficient way to exchange 
molecules between cells and transduction of the cell-to-cell and matrix-to-cell
signals. Derangement in those important structures' physical integrity and/or
function, which can be assessed by the presence or absence of several
intercellular bridge proteins including claudin-4, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, was
found to be related to several phenomena in the path to the neoplastic
transformation. However, these proteins have not been studied in the wide variety
of the skin neoplasms, in detail. Herein, we immunohistochemically assessed the
expression patterns of these 3 intercellular bridge proteins on a total of 86
epidermal and eccrine adnexal tumors including basal cell carcinoma, squamous
cell carcinoma, poroma, spiradenoma, syringoma, and hidradenoma. We observed a
selective and distinct claudin-4 expression in the ductal-type cells of all cases
of spiradenomas. Similarly, in the poromas, syringomas, and hidradenomas,
claudin-4 was only positive in the luminal cells of microcystic structures,
although not as conspicuous as in the spiradenomas. On the other hand, E-cadherin
and β-catenin were positive in almost all types of the tumors, in a way which was
not contributory to differentiate from each other. In conclusion, we think that
claudin-4 can be helpful at least in making a reliable differential diagnosis of 
spiradenoma when overlapping morphologic features do not allow to further
subclassification in the overwhelming variety of the adnexal tumors.

BACKGROUND: Novel histopathological prognostic features for squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) of lung, such as tumor budding, mitotic rate, tumor stroma ratio,
stroma type, stromal inflammation and necrosis, have been evaluated in the
literature. In this study, the prognostic value of multiple morphological
features is assessed in lung SCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reports on seventy-six patients with lung SCC
treated with complete surgical excision. Tumor size, tumor stage, lymph node
status, lymphovascular invasion, histopathologic grade, mitotic count, necrosis, 
tumor budding, tumor stroma ratio, stroma type, stromal lymphoplasmacytic
reaction and ratios of stromal plasma cells and their relationship with the
prognosis were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for
histopathological markers for local disease free survival (LDFS), distant disease
free survival (DDFS), overall disease free survival (ODFS) and overall survival
(OS).
RESULTS: The univariate prognostic analysis of the pathological factors revealed 
that the pathological stage (OS: p=0.001, DDFS: p=0.040), lymph node metastases
(OS: p=0.013), mitotic index (OS: p=0.026), tumor necrosis (DDFS: p=0.013, ODFS: 
p=0.021) and tumor size (OS: p=0.002) had a prognostic significance. The
multivariate analysis demonstrated that the pathological stage (OS: p=0.021),
tumor size (OS: p=0.044), lymph node status (DDFS: p=0.019, ODFS; p=0.041) and
necrosis (ODFS: p=0.048) were independent prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Although many histopathological factors have recently been proposed 
as important prognostic markers, we only found significant results for mitotic
index and tumor necrosis, as well as the well known parameters such as tumor
stage and lymph node status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study evaluating such a wide range of morphological prognostic factors in lung
SCC.

BACKGROUND: Hexamethylene bisacetamide-inducible protein 1 (Hexim1) regulates
transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) activity and turnover of SMAD proteins in a
cyclin-dependent kinase 9-dependent way. It does so specifically through
inhibiting function of this enzyme and by inhibiting the transcriptional activity
of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) play a role in the progression of prostate adenocarcinomas. We
investigated the clinicopathological significance of Hexim1, TGFβ, SMAD2, and
SMAD7 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma cells, and assessed associations
between TAMs density and these proteins.
METHODS: The cases of 100 patients diagnosed with prostate acinar adenocarcinoma 
who had undergone radical prostatectomy were retrospectively examined. Each was
reviewed for Gleason score, cancer stage, and specific histopathological
features. Original slides were re-examined, and new slides were prepared and
immunostained with Hexim1, TGFβ, SMAD2, SMAD7 and CD68.
RESULTS: Hexim1 expression was positively correlated with Gleason score, cancer
stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and
positive surgical margin. TAMs density was positively correlated with Gleason
score, cancer stage, perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and positive
surgical margin. TAMs density was positively correlated with Hexim1 expression
and TGFβ expression. More advanced cancer stage, lymphovascular invasion,
perineural invasion, and extracapsular extension were correlated with strong
Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression,
respectively. Strong Hexim1 expression, strong TGFβ expression, and mild SMAD7
expression were associated with higher Gleason score. Strong Hexim1 expression
was correlated with strong TGFβ expression and mild SMAD7 expression. Strong
Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild expression of SMAD7 were
associated with disease progression. Strong SMAD2 expression was associated with 
shorter disease-free survival.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that greater TAMs density, strong Hexim1
expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression play important
roles in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. Further investigation of
these proteins will help facilitate the definitive prognosis of prostate
adenocarcinomas. Ultimately, these proteins may be therapeutic targets for
patients with prostate cancer.

Esophageal cancer is a poor-prognosis malignancy that ranks eighth among all
cancer types, and its prevalence shows differences among geographical regions.
Although the most important risk factors for esophageal carcinoma are alcohol and
smoking, viral infections, particularly HPV infection, are also considered among 
etiological agents. Our study aims to detect the presence of HPV in esophageal
cancers in our patient population and to investigate its correlation with
clinico-pathological parameters. We investigated the presence of HPV-DNA by
real-time polymerase chain reaction in a total of 52 patients with esophageal
cancer. Subtype analysis was performed in positive cases and was correlated with 
selected clinico-pathological parameters. Five (9.6%) of 52 tumor samples, 3
squamous cell carcinomas (3/33 cases) and 2 adenocarcinomas (2/19 cases), were
HPV-DNA-positive. Subtype analysis could be performed in four HPV-DNA-positive
cases, of which three were HPV type-39 and 1 was type-16. The Marmara region,
where the present study was carried out, is a region with low-moderate risk for
esophageal cancer, and the prevalence of HPV-DNA in these tumors is similar to
the prevalence of HPV-DNA reported in the literature for regions with similar
risk. In conclusion, we detected HPV DNA in a subset of esophageal and
gastroesophageal junction tumors. HPV infection may have a role in esophageal
carcinogenesis and high-risk HPV subtypes can particularly be considered among
risk factors since the prevalence of high risk HPV infection has also been found 
to be increased in regions with a high risk for esophageal cancer compared to
low-moderate risk regions.

Polymorphisms in Lys939Gln XPC gene may diminish DNA repair capacity, eventually 
increasing the risk of carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to
evaluate the significance of polymorphism Lys939Gln in XPC gene in patients with 
mitral chordae tendinea rupture (MCTR). Twenty-one patients with MCTR and
thirty-seven age and sex matched controls were enrolled in the study. Genotyping 
of XPC gene Lys939Gln polymorphism was carried out using polymerase chain
reaction- (PCR-) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The frequencies
of the heterozygote genotype (Lys/Gln-AC) and homozygote genotype (Gln/Gln-CC)
were significantly different in MCTR as compared to control group, respectively
(52.4% versus 43.2%, p = 0.049; 38.15% versus 16.2%, p = 0.018). Homozygote
variant (Gln/Gln) genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of
MCTR (OR = 2.059; 95% CI: 1.097-3.863; p = 0.018). Heterozygote variant (Lys/Gln)
genotype was also highly significantly associated with increased risk of MCTR (OR
= 1.489; 95% CI: 1.041-2.129; p = 0.049). The variant allele C was found to be
significantly associated with MCTR (OR = 1.481; 95% CI: 1.101-1.992; p = 0.011). 
This study has demonstrated the association of XPC gene Lys939Gln polymorphism
with MCTR, which is significantly associated with increased risk of MCTR.

We have read the case report of Nihon-Yanagi et al. The patient they described
developed hepatic granuloma two times and the granulomatous lesion was
surrounding metal staples/clips suggesting that the granuloma was due to surgical
staples/clips. Hepatic granulomas (HGs) are reported in around 5% of patient who 
undergo a liver biopsy and caused by several diseases including sarcoidosis,
tuberculosis, hydatid cyst, brucellosis, typhoid fever, chronic hepatitis B and C
and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Chronic hepatitis B and C infections are the
most common and serious causes of liver damage in patient with renal failure.
Their prevalence is a higher than people without renal failure. We have
previously reported that the prevalences of HGs in patients with chronic
hepatitis B and C are 1.5 and 1.3% respectively. The described patient was on
hemodialysis for 12 years. The other causes of HG seem excluded; however
hepatitis B and C infections and PBC should have been tested and excluded before 
ascribing the HGs to surgical staples/clipping material.

The potential toxic effects of several pesticides, including imidacloprid on
non-target organisms have not been clearly established. Also, the chronic effects
of non-toxic doses on cognitive function in mammals are unknown. In this study,
the effects of different doses of imidacloprid on learning and memory of infant
and adult rats were evaluated, and the expressions of genes synthesizing proteins
known to be associated with learning in brain tissues were also documented. 0.5, 
2 and 8 mg/kg doses of imidacloprid were administered to newborn infant and adult
Wistar albino rats by gavage. Their learning activities were evaluated, and the
expression levels of the inotropic glutamate receptor GRIN1, synoptophysin,
growth-associated protein 43 and the muscarinic receptor M1 in hippocampus were
determined by real-time PCR method. Learning activities were diminished
significantly at 2 and 8 mg/kg doses in the infant model groups and at 8 mg/kg
dose in adult rats. Also, expression levels of GRIN1, SYP and GAP-43 were found
to be insignificantly altered. Only the expression of M1 were significantly
changed in high doses of adult group. Thus imidacloprid in high doses causes
deterioration in cognitive functions particularly in infant rats, and this
deterioration may be associated with changes in the expressions of related genes.

Ependymomas commonly arise in the central nervous system. Extraneural
presentation is quite rare. Herein, we describe a primary extraneural ependymoma 
in a young female. The mass was located in the right inguinal area. The cut
surface of the 7.5 mm × 6.5 mm × 4.5 mm sized tumor was brownish-yellow in color.
Histologically, it was hypercellular exhibiting pseudorosette or rosette
formations and some papillary structures. Mitosis was counted as high as 10 per
10 high power fields. Neither necrosis nor vascular endothelial proliferation
within the tumor was observed. Tumor cells showed strong glial fibrillary acidic 
protein immunoreactivity. On epithelial membrane antigen, intracytoplasmic
dot-like immunostaining was observed. This is the first report presenting a
primary extraneural anaplastic ependymoma arising in the inguinal subcutaneous
region.

Nevus sebaceus (NS) is a congenital, benign, hamartomatous lesion and it is
possible to see several benign or malignant tumors accompanying it. One of these 
is the poroma, which is very rare, and has only been reported twice before, in
the English literature. In this paper, we presented two new cases of NS. One of
them was a 40-year-old male who presented with a congenital skin lesion on his
temporoparietal region. This lesion was composed of four different lesions,
including NS, poroma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and verruca vulgaris. The
second patient was a 41-year-old male presenting with a yellow-brown patch on the
scalp. This lesion was comprised of NS and BCC. In addition to these
presentations, we discussed the differential diagnosis between BCC and
trichoblastoma, both of which are likely to be seen with NS. For this purpose, we
recommended an immunohistological panel, which may be useful for differentiating 
these two morphologically similar lesions.

Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a protozoan parasite with the potential of
causing severe encephalitis among immunocompromised humans and animals. Our
previous study showed that T. gondii induces high nitric oxide (NO) production,
high glial activation (GFAP) and neurofilament expressions, leading to severe
neurodegeneration in toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) in the central nervous system
(CNS). The aim of this experimental study was to investigate ADAMTS-13 expression
and apoptosis in CNS and to identify whether they have any correlation with
toxoplasmosis neuropathology and neurodegeneration. Mice were infected with ME49 
strain T. gondii and the levels of ADAMTS-13, caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9,
TNFR1 and Bcl-xL expressions were examined in brain tissues by
immunohistochemistry, during the development and establishment of chronic
infections at 10, 30 and 60 days post-infection. Results of the study revealed
that the levels of ADAMTS-13 (P < 0.005), caspase 3 (P < 0.05), caspase 8 (P <
0.05), caspase 9 (P < 0.005) and TNFR1 (P < 0.05) expressions in the brain
markedly increased while Bcl-xL expression decreased (P < 0.005). The most
prominent finding from our study was that 10, 30 and 60 days post-infection
ADAMTS-13 increased significantly and this may play an important role in the
regulation and protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity and CNS
microenvironment in TE. These results also suggest that T. gondii-mediated
apoptosis might play a pivotal role and a different type of role in the mechanism
of neurodegeneration and neuropathology in the process of TE. Furthermore,
expression of ADAMTS-13 might give an idea of the progress and is critical for
diagnosis of this disease. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
first report on ADAMTS-13 expression in the CNS of T. gondii-infected mice.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the ultrastructural changes in the liver
cells of mole rats (Spalax leucodon) exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).
Thirteen mole rats used in this study were caught from nature. They were divided 
into four groups. The first group was separated as a control and was not given
any radiation. The rest were exposed to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation for 7, 14, 
and 21 days. The electron microscopic examinations revealed that significant
ultrastructural changes occurred in the liver tissue. These changes were the
reduction in cytoplasmic organelles, dilatation in rough endoplasmic reticulum,
impairment of nucleus membrane, and broadened and vacuolated mitochondria in the 
cytoplasm. Also, UVC radiation caused significant changes in liver enzymes of
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and
gama-glutamiltransferase values. After long-term exposure to radiation, some
excessive ultrastructural changes occurred. These results indicated that longer
exposure to UVR would cause more ultrastructural effects on the liver cells and
liver enzymes.

The association between papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and Hashimoto's
thyroiditis (HT) is controversial. In this study, we aimed to compare
preoperative thyroid functions, ultrasonography (US) features, fine-needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results, and histopathological characteristics of PTC in
patients with and without HT. Data of 919 PTC patients were reviewed
retrospectively. The diagnosis of HT was based on histopathological examination
and patients were grouped as HT and non-HT. There were 1321 PTC lesions in 919
patients among which 317 (34.5 %) had coexistent HT. There were no significant
differences in nodule volume, longitudinal diameter, texture, echogenicity,
marginal regularity, presence of microcalcification and hypoechoic halo, and
peripheral vascularization in patients with and without HT (p > 0.05, for all
parameters). Macrocalcification was observed more frequently in the non-HT group 
(p = 0.021). FNAB results were similar in the two groups (p = 0.105).
Distribution of variants, capsule invasion, vascular invasion, and extrathyroidal
extension were observed with similar rates in the HT and non-HT groups. Lymph
node metastasis was significantly higher in patients without HT (p = 0.012). Of
the carcinomas, 66.1 % (n = 874) were papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).
Tumor size was lower in PTMC lesions coexistent with HT (p = 0.026). We observed 
lower rates of capsule invasion, extrathyroidal extension, and lymph node
metastases in PTMC with HT compared to without HT (p = 0.007, p = 0.003, and
p = 0.015, respectively). This study showed that US features, FNAB results, and
histopathological findings of PTC lesions are not influenced by the presence of
HT. However, PTMC seems to be related with less aggressive histopathological
behavior in HT.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) linked to germline mutation of succinate dehydrogenase
subunits A, B, C, and D (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, respectively) has been
recently included as a provisional entity in the 2013 International Society of
Urological Pathology Vancouver classification. Most SDH-deficient tumors show
SDHB mutation, with only a small number of RCC with SDHC or SDHD having been
reported to date. Only one case of SDH-deficient renal carcinoma known to be SDHA
mutated has been previously reported. Here we report an additional RCC harboring 
an SDHA mutation occurring in a 62-year-old man with right flank pain and nodal
metastasis. The tumor was characterized by an infiltrative pattern with solid,
acinar, and papillary components. Loss of SDHA and SDHB protein by
immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. Hybrid capture-based comprehensive 
genomic profiling identified 3 genomic alterations in tumor tissue: (i) a novel
single-nucleotide splice site deletion in SDHA gene, (ii) single-nucleotide
deletion in NF2 gene, and (iii) EGFR gene amplification of 19 copies. This is the
second report of SDHA-mutated RCC. With increased awareness, this rare tumor can 
be recognized on the basis of distinctive morphology and confirmation by
immunohistochemistry and genomic profiling.

The study aim is to evaluate the placental histopathological characteristics and 
maternal risk factors in preterm and term births according to their weeks of
gestation. We designed a prospective study involving a patient population (n =
355) composed of pregnant women who delivered preterm (n = 216) and term neonates
(n = 139). The preterm births were divided into three groups as extremely (n =
22), moderate (n = 96) and late preterm (n = 98) births. The statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS version 15 software. There was significant difference
regarding maternal vascular underperfusion and inflammation in the extremely
preterm group compared with the other groups (P = 0.001), but fetal vascular
obstruction and villitis of unknown etiology were not found significantly
different. According to our study results, the careful examination of the
placenta of premature babies, particularly those of extremely preterm births,
should be part of routine obstetrical management to determine the causes of
preterm birth.

BACKGROUND: The triple test, i.e., cytology combined with clinical and
radiological findings, is the goal for accurate assessment of palpable breast
lesions. Because of the limitations of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC),
its utility has somewhat decreased nationwide. We have been using a combination
of physical examination, radiological modalities, and FNAC for the diagnosis of
palpable/nonpalpable breast mass lesions for the last 23 years. Our institutional
experience of the last 10 years is presented here, using FNAC of breast lesions
along with an analysis of the diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: 4956 breast aspirates in 4860 cases were collected from the computer
database of Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital in Istanbul,
Turkey. Most of the FNACs were performed under ultrasound guidance and FNAC
procedures were performed by radiologists and pathologists who used 22 gauge
needles. Cytological diagnoses were classified as "unsatisfactory", "benign",
"malignant", "atypical/probably benign", "atypical/probably malignant", and
"atypical/NOS" (not otherwise specified) and were compared to the
histopathological diagnoses obtained from core needle biopsy, lumpectomy or
mastectomy to give an assessment of the diagnostic performance of FNAC in 733
aspirates.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive
value, false positive, and false negative rates of FNAC were 98.02, 90.58, 95.97,
96.48, 94.54, 2.6, and 1.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study once again shows that FNAC is a reliable method for the
initial evaluation and diagnosis of breast masses. In case of any suspicious
conditions, FNAC, and core biopsy are considered complementary to one another.

OBJECTIVE: In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Jun N-terminal
kinase inhibitor (SP600125) on fibrosis and inflammation in rats with polycystic 
ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHOD: 50 Wistar-albino rats were divided into five groups (n=10 each): control 
group, sham group, PCOS group, SP600125+ PCOS group and SP600125 group. In the
estradiol valerate (EV)-treated group in which PCOS was injected with a single 4 
mg/kg i.p. of EV in 0.2 ml sesame oil and the rats were sacrificed on day 60. The
estradiol valerate (EV)-treated + SP600125-treated group was injected with a
single 4 mg/kg i.p. of EV in 0.2 ml sesame oil. As of day 60, the treatment group
was additionally given 15 mg/kg i.p. of SP600125 once daily for 4 consecutive
days and the rats were sacrificed on day 65. Histopathological findings (ovarian 
morphology, edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular congestion and
hyperemia) and collagen type IV immunoexpression were assessed.
RESULTS: The SP600125+ PCOS group showed a significant level of improvement in
ovarian follicle morphology, edema, inflammatory infiltrate, vascular congestion 
and hyperemia as compared with the PCOS group. Furthermore, collagen type IV
immunoexpression showed a significant reduction in staining intensity on the
theca cell layer and ovary stroma as compared to the PCOS group.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the therapeutic effect of SP600125 in the
prevention of PCOS in an experimental model.

This study aims to investigate the acute protective effect of montelukast sodium 
in hepatic injury secondary to acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication. This study used
60 rats. The rats were grouped into 6 groups. The control group was administered 
oral distilled water 10 ml/kg, the APAP group oral APAP 1 g/kg, the montelukast
sodium (MK) group oral MK 30 mg/kg, the acetaminophen+N-acetylcysteine (APAP+NAC)
group oral APAP 1 g/kg, followed by a single dose of intraperitoneal NAC 1.5 g/kg
three hours later, the acetaminophen+montelukast sodium (APAP+MK) group oral APAP
1 g/kg, followed by oral MK 30 mg/kg 3 h later, the
acetaminophen+N-acetylcysteine+montelukast sodium (APAP+NAC+MK) group oral APAP 1
g/kg, followed by a single intraperitoneal NAC 1.5 g/kg plus oral MK 30 mg/kg 3 h
later. Blood and liver tissue samples were taken 24h after drug administration.
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin were studied from the blood samples. Liver
tissue samples were used for histopathological examination. Compared with the
control group, serum AST and ALT activities were higher in the APAP and APAP+NAC 
groups. APAP+NAC, APAP+MK, and APAP+NAC+MK groups had reduced serum ALT and AST
activities than the group administered APAP alone. APAP+MK and APAP+NAC+MK groups
had a lower serum ALP activity than the control group. Histopathologically, there
was a difference between the group administered APAP alone and the APAP+MK and
APAP+NAC+MK groups. MK is as protective as NAC in liver tissue in APAP
intoxication in rats.

Plasmacytic differentiation may occur in almost all small B cell lymphomas
(SBLs), although it varies from being uniformly present (as in lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma (LPL)) to very uncommon (as in mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs)). The
discovery of MYD88 L265P mutations in the vast majority of LPLs has had a major
impact on the study of these lymphomas. Review of the cases contributed to the
2014 European Association for Haematopathology/Society for Hematopathology slide 
workshop illustrated how mutational testing has helped refine the diagnostic
criteria for LPL, emphasizing the importance of identifying a clonal monotonous
lymphoplasmacytic population and highlighting how LPL can still be diagnosed with
extensive nodal architectural effacement, very subtle plasmacytic
differentiation, follicular colonization, or uncommon phenotypes such as CD5 or
CD10 expression. MYD88 L265P mutations were found in 11/11 LPL cases versus only 
2 of 28 other SBLs included in its differential diagnosis. Mutational testing
also helped to exclude other cases that would have been considered LPL in the
past. The workshop also highlighted how plasmacytic differentiation can occur in 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma,
SOX11 negative MCL, and particularly in marginal zone lymphomas, all of which can
cause diagnostic confusion with LPL. The cases also highlighted the difficulty in
distinguishing lymphomas with marked plasmacytic differentiation from plasma cell
neoplasms. Some SBLs with plasmacytic differentiation can be associated with
amyloid, other immunoglobulin deposition, or crystal-storing histiocytosis, which
may obscure the underlying neoplasm. Finally, although generally indolent, LPL
may transform, with the workshop cases suggesting a role for TP53 abnormalities.

The authors present two cases of primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma
(SEF) of the kidney. Both patients had a mass in the upper part of the left
kidney without any primary extrarenal neoplastic lesions. Grossly, the tumors
were solid masses both measuring 7.5 cm in the greatest diameter. Histologically,
one of the lesions exhibited a predominantly lobular growth of round or oval
small uniform epithelioid cells in variable cellularity. Circular zones of
crowded tumor cells alternating with hypocellular collagenous tissue in a
concentric fashion around entrapped native renal tubules were distinctive. The
second case was distinctive with significant cytological atypia in the neoplastic
cells and prominent reactive proliferations in the trapped renal tubules.
Immunohistochemically, vimentin, bcl-2 and MUC4 were diffusely positive in both. 
They were negative for S-100 protein, CD34, and desmin, whereas CD99 were
positive in one lesion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using dual
staining probes detected EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion in each lesion, which is
characteristic molecular findings of SEF. One patient presented widespread
distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. In the other, no tumor deposits were
detected other than primary. Both patients have been alive with 30 and 10 month
follow-ups, respectively. These tumors are 6th and 7th cases of primary renal SEF
in the literature confirmed by FISH study, which exhibit unique and remarkable
histomorphologic features.

BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a specialized subpopulation of CD4+ T 
cells which maintain the immune system homeostasis. They may increase during
cancer progression and have been correlated with a worse prognosis in many
malignancies. However, the role of Treg cells in lymphoma is debated.
METHODS: In this study, we assessed the peripheral blood levels of CD4+ CD25+
FOXP3+ Tregs in newly diagnosed patients with lymphoma and tried to find a
relationship with patient characteristics. Twenty one patients with Hodgkin
lymphoma (HL), 40 patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 30 healthy sex
matched controls were included in the study. Analysis were done by 3-color flow
cytometry and only helper T cells were selected directly using CD4perCP as a
gating strategy.
RESULTS: In HL group; there was a positive correlation with IPS, CRP, LDH and
negative correlation with albumin, absolute lymphocyte count. Tregs were higher
in male HL patients. In NHL group; there was a positive correlation with stage,
IPI, CRP, LDH and a negative correlation with albumin ve absolute lymphocyte
count.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a relationship between peripheral blood Treg levels and
some poor prognostic parameters in newly diagnosed lymphoma patients. This
relationship suggests a possible prognostic role of Tregs in lymphoma. Further
research is needed in determining how to use Tregs as a prognostic factor. © 2015

INTRODUCTION: Haemolytic disease of newborns due to rhesus and AB0
incompatibility is encountered frequently in neonatal clinics and may lead to
severe haemolysis. In this study, it is suggested that important amounts of iron 
released with haemolysis may have a toxic effect on the brain parenchymal tissue,
and the severity of the toxic effect can be correlated with the maturation of the
brain barrier systems. To demonstrate the accumulation and the neuro-toxic
effects of free iron (Fe) in the brain an experimental haemolysis model with
various maturation phases was performed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was composed of 48 Wistar rats with the following
ages: five days old (Group A), 10 days old (Group B), and 19 days old (Group C). 
Each group was divided into three experimental subgroups and three control
groups. Experimental groups were treated with intraperitoneal 75 mg/kg/day phenyl
hydrazine hydrochloride for haemolysis.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that the blood brain barrier (BBB) is permeable in
five-day-old newborn rats and is mature in 10- and 19-day-old rats. Iron staining
and neuronal damage were detected in group A and group B rats. No damage was
detected in the brain tissue of group C animals. The presence of iron staining
and neuronal damage in group B with mature BBB may suggest the existence of other
incomplete barrier systems different from BBB that lead to iron accumulation in
the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood brain barrier has a partial role in Fe transport, and the
alternative barrier systems may also be involved. It could be supposed that after
maturation of all barrier systems, excessive Fe penetration to the brain cannot
occur. Our findings showed that the toxic amounts of iron may penetrate into the 
brain parenchyma of newborns despite the BBB preservation and cause neuronal
damage in newborns, but the mature brain is not affected by the same magnitude
blood levels.

BACKGROUND: CIP2A, an inhibitor of PP2A tumour suppressor function, is a widely
overexpressed biomarker of aggressive disease and poor therapy response in
multiple human cancer types.
METHODS: CIP2A and DPPA4 copy number alterations and expression were analysed by 
fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in
different cell lines and a tissue microarray of 52 HNSCC patients. Results were
correlated with patient survival and other clinicopathological data.
RESULTS: CIP2A and DPPA4 copy number increase occurred at a relatively high
frequency in human HNSCC patient samples. CIP2A but not DPPA4 FISH status was
significantly associated with patient survival. CIP2A detection by combining IHC 
with FISH yielded superior resolution in the prognostication of HNSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: CIP2A copy number increase is associated with poor patient survival 
in human HNSCC. We suggest that the reliability and prognostic value of CIP2A
detection can be improved by performing FISH analysis to CIP2A IHC positive
tumours.

Malignant blue nevi (MBN) are extremely rare dermal melanocytic tumors that arise
in association with atypical cellular blue nevi (ACBN), cellular blue nevi (CBN),
common blue nevi (BN), or de novo. The frequency of BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations
in malignant melanoma varies according to histological subtype and localization. 
These mutations are rarely observed in blue nevi, which have recently been shown 
to carry activating mutations in GNAQ/GNA11 genes. Only few small molecular
studies of MBN have been published. The aim of the present study was to analyze
in MBN and related blue lesions such as ACBN, CBN, and BN the prevalence of BRAF,
NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11 gene mutations and their association with
clinicopathological features. We included in our study 12 MBN, 6 ACBN, 29 CBN,
and 35 common BN diagnosed between 1996 and 2014. Sanger sequencing method was
used for mutation analysis. Overall, GNAQ exon 5 mutation was the most frequent
alteration (46 %), in 2 of 12 (17 %) MBN, 1 of 6 (17 %) ACBN, 22 of 29 (76 %)
CBN, and 13 of 35 (37 %) common BN. BRAF V600E and GNA11 exon 5 mutations were
respectively detected in 3 of 12 (25 %) and in 2 of 12 (17 %) MBN while none in
ACBN, CBN, and common BN. None of the cases harbored NRAS exon 2/3, KIT exon
9/11/13/17/18, or GNAQ/GNA11 exon 4 mutations. GNAQ gene exon 5 mutations are
rare in MBN and ACBN but frequent in CBN and common BN. Remarkably, BRAF V600E
and GNA11 exon 5 mutations were only detected in MBN, whereas none were found in 
ACBN, CBN, or common BN. Our data contribute new elements to the limited data on 
molecular alterations in MBN.

INTRODUCTION: Hanging is the most common suicide method in the world, and the
discrimination of antemortem-postmortem hanging must be done at autopsy. The aim 
of this experimental study was to examine the immunohistochemical expression of
IL-1β antibody at the hanging mark skin samples of rats to discriminate
antemortem and postmortem hangings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 Wistar albino rats were used for this study.
The groups were as follows: A-1, antemortem control group; A-2, antemortem
second-hour hanging mark skin samples; A-3, antemortem 24th-hour hanging mark
skin samples; A-4, antemortem 72nd-hour hanging mark skin samples; B-1,
postmortem control group; and B-2, postmortem second-hour hanging mark skin
samples. Interleukin-1β immunostaining was performed to all tissue samples.
RESULTS: For epidermal cells, group A-1 samples did not show IL-1β
immunostaining, group A-2 samples were severely immunostained, and groups A-3 and
A-4 samples' staining were slightly decreased. There was no IL-1β antibody
staining in groups B-1 and B-2 samples. For adnexal cells, groups A-1 and B-1
samples did not show IL-1β immunostaining, staining of group A-2 samples was mild
to severe, and groups A-3 and A-4 samples' staining were slightly decreased. Half
of the group B-2 samples did not show IL-1β immunostaining. For subepidermal
cells, most of the samples of groups A-1 and B-1 showed slight immunostaining,
groups A-2 and B-2 samples' staining were mild to severe, and there were slight
immunostaining in groups A-3 and A-4 samples. The majority of vascular structure 
cells did not show IL-1β immunostaining.
CONCLUSION: Interleukin-1β immunostaining of epidermal cells can discriminate
antemortem-postmortem hangings, but vascular structure cells and subepidermal
cells cannot discriminate vital hangings.

Skeletal dysplasias (SDs) constitute a group of heterogeneous disorders affecting
growth morphology of the chondro-osseous tissues. Prenatal diagnosis of SD is a
considerable clinical challenge due to phenotypic variability. We performed a
retrospective analysis of the fetal autopsies series conducted between January
2006 and December 2012 at our center. SD was detected in 54 (10%) out of 542
fetal autopsy cases which included; 11.1% thanatophoric dysplasia (n = 6), 7.4%
achondroplasia (n = 4), 3.7% osteogenesis imperfect (n = 2), 1.9% Jarcho-Levin
Syndrome (n = 1), 1.9% arthrogryposis (n = 1), 1.9% Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen
syndrome (n = 1), 72.1% of dysostosis cases (n = 39). All SD cases were diagnosed
by ultrasonography. In 20 of the cases, amniocentesis was performed, 4 cases
underwent molecular genetic analyses. Antenatal identification of dysplasia is
important in the management of pregnancy and in genetic counseling. Our data
analysis showed that SD is usually detected clinically after the 20th gestational
week. Genetic analyses for SD may provide early diagnosis and management.

Epithelial-stroma interactions in the endometrium are known to be responsible for
physiological functions and emergence of several pathologic lesions.
Periglandular stromal cells act on endometrial cells in a paracrine manner
through sex hormones. In this study, we immunohistochemically evaluated the
expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators (SNAIL/SLUG, TWIST,
ZEB1), adhesion molecules (β-catenin and E-cadhenin), estrogen (ER)-progesterone 
(PR) receptor and their correlation with each other in 30 benign, 148
hyperplastic (EH), and 101 endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma (EC)
endometria. In the epithelial component, loss of expression in E-cadherin, ER and
PR, and overexpression of TWIST and ZEB1 were significantly higher in EC than in 
EH (P<0.01). In the periglandular stromal component, β-catenin and SNAIL/SLUG
expression were significantly higher in normal endometrium and simple without
atypical EH compared with complex atypical EH and EC (P<0.01). In addition,
periglandular stromal TWIST expression was significantly higher in EH group
compared with EC (P<0.05). There was significantly negative correlation between
β-catenin and ER, TWIST and ER, and TWIST and PR in hyperplastic and
carcinomatous glandular epithelium, whereas there was a significantly positive
correlation between β-catenin and SNAIL-SLUG, β-catenin and TWIST, β-catenin and 
ER, β-catenin and PR, SNAIL-SLUG and ER, SNAIL-SLUG and PR, TWIST and ER, TWIST
and PR, in periglandular/cancer-associated stromal cells (P<0.01). In conclusion,
the pattern of positive and negative correlations in the expression of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators (SNAIL-SLUG and TWIST), sex hormone 
receptors (ER and PR), and β-catenin between ECs and hyperplasia, as well as
between epithelium and stroma herein, is suggestive of a significant role for
these proteins and their underlying molecular processes in the development of
endometrial carcinomas.

Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology characterized by 
clinical, histological, and immunological features, generally including
circulating autoantibodies and a high total serum and/or gamma globulin.
Liver-related autoantibodies are very significant for the correct diagnosis and
classification of autoimmune liver diseases (AILD), namely autoimmune hepatitis
types 1 and 2 (AIH-1 and 2), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and the sclerosing 
cholangitis types in adults and children. This article intends to review recent
studies that investigate autoantibodies in autoimmune liver diseases from a
microbiological perspective.

Hydatid Disease Involved in the Heart, Liver, and Kidney That Caused Sudden
Death: Case Report.

Daş T(1), Özer M, Yağmur G, Yildirim M, Özgün A, Demirel H.

Hydatid disease is a parasitic infestation caused by ingestion of eggs of
echinococcal species. For Echinococcus granulosus, the definitive host is the
dog, and sheeps are the usual intermediate hosts. Humans are accidental
intermediate hosts, infected by ingestion of food contaminated with eggs shed by 
dogs or foxes. The most common organs that hydatid disease encountered are the
liver and lungs. Involvement of the kidney is rare and usually accompanies the
other organ involvements. Cardiac involvement of echinococcosis is also very
rare. We report the case of a 31-year-old woman with a 6-year history of asthma
who collapsed after strenuous activity and died despite the interventions carried
out. At autopsy, cystic masses were detected in the apex of the heart, in the
right kidney, and in the liver. There were no macroscopic pathologic findings in 
the other organs. Microscopic examination revealed the diagnosis of hydatid cyst 
in the heart, right kidney, and liver besides medial hypertrophy of the lung
vessels. Cause of death was attributed to hydatid cyst and its complications.
Patients who have symptoms akin to asthma at clinical presentation have to be
further investigated for organic cardiac and pulmonary diseases such as hydatid
cyst, especially in endemic countries.

EMMPRIN (CD147) Expression in Smooth Muscle Tumors of the Uterus.

Kefeli M(1), Yildiz L, Gun S, Ozen FZ, Karagoz F.

Author information:

Samsun, Turkey.

Smooth muscle tumors of the uterus are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the 
gynecologic tract. The vast majority of these are benign leiomyomas that present 
no diagnostic difficulty. Because some benign smooth muscle tumors may degenerate
and uncommon variants exist, the diagnosis can be challenging in some cases. The 
goal of this research was to investigate EMMPRIN expression in leiomyomas,
leiomyoma variants, and leiomyosarcomas (LMS) to determine whether it has a
potential role in differential diagnosis. EMMPRIN expression was investigated
with immunohistochemistry in 103 uterine smooth muscle tumors, which included 19 
usual leiomyomas, 52 leiomyoma variants, and 32 LMS. They were evaluated on the
basis of staining extent, intensity, and also their combined score, and the
groups were compared. EMMPRIN expression was present in 3 of 19 (15.7%) usual
leiomyomas, 23 of 52 (44.3%) leiomyoma variants, and 28 of 32 (87.5%) LMS. There 
were statistically significant differences in staining extent and intensity, and 
also for their combined scores, between the LMS and benign groups. Although
uterine smooth muscle tumors are usually diagnosed easily with conventional
diagnostic criteria, the differentiation of LMS from some variants of leiomyoma
can be challenging based soley on morphology. EMMPRIN may be a valuable
immunohistochemical marker for differentiating LMS from benign smooth muscle
tumors in problematic cases.

Prostate Cancer (PCa) holds the second place in terms of cancer-related mortality
rate among men. The Notch signalling pathway regulates the proliferation and
differentiation in embryonic and adult tissues and determines the cell fate. The 
body of knowledge in the present literature is currently controversial about the 
effect of the Notch pathway on prostatic cancer. Therefore, the present study
aimed to examine the immunolocalization and expression levels of Notch1-4,
Jagged1-2, Delta, HES1 and HES5 from among the members of the Notch signalling
pathway in tissues of normal, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and
malignant prostate. The current study included a sample of 20 patients with
localised prostatic adenocarcinoma, 18 patients with high grade PIN (H-PIN) and
18 normal prostatic tissue. Immunolocalisations of Notch1, 2, 3, 4, Jagged1, 2,
Delta, HES1 and HES5 were identified through the immunohistochemical method. The 
findings of the present study showed that all in-scope members of the Notch
signalling pathway were localised in PIN structures to a greater extent than in
other tissues and from amongst these members, specifically Notch1, Notch4,
Jagged1 and HES1 were at more significant levels. Consequently, the findings of
the present study may indicate that the Notch signalling pathway can play a role 
especially in the formation of PIN structures.

INTRODUCTION: The thymus slowly involutes with age after puberty. Various stress 
conditions accelerate the involution of the thymus and cause changes in the
histologic structure of the gland.
OBJECTIVE: The present study performed histomorphological and immunohistochemical
(IHC) evaluations of the thymus glands removed during surgical repair in patients
with cyanotic or acyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). The thymus glands in
the hypoxic group were compared to those in the non-hypoxic group. This study
suggested that the activation of HIF-1 alpha promotes tumor progression and
impair prognosis due to the inhibition of apoptosis, increased population of stem
cells, and induction of angiogenesis also suggested that inactivation of HIF-1
alpha in tumor-infiltrated tissues could halt tumor progression and improve
prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 76 thymus glands removed from patients 
who underwent an operation due to CHD. Of these cases, 38 had cyanotic CHD, and
constituted the hypoxic group. The remaining 38 patients had acyanotic CHD, and
constituted the non-hypoxic group. IHC procedures were performed for HIF-1 alpha,
FoxP3, CD44, Bcl-2, and CD34.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the hypoxic and
non-hypoxic groups only in terms of medullary enlargement toward the cortex and
effacement of the corticomedullary junction. In the immunohistochemical
examination for five markers, staining intensity and staining rates increased
with decreasing oxygen saturation.
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the activation of HIF-1 alpha promotes tumor
progression and impair prognosis due to the inhibition of apoptosis, increased
population of stem cells, and induction of angiogenesis.

University Gorukle, Nilufer, Bursa, Turkey.

The accuracy rate of frozen section constitutes an important step of quality
assessment step in pathology practice. This study aimed to investigate pulmonary 
lesions that were incorrectly diagnosed or postponed for routine examination by
pathologists at frozen section examination; it also aimed to discuss the reasons 
for difficult diagnoses and the various clues enabling the correct diagnosis to
be made when such lesions are encountered. This study retrospectively reviewed
the medical data of the thoracic surgery cases that underwent frozen section
examination between 2009 and 2014. Frozen section errors and deferrals were
identified in 25 cases. Fourteen (56%) lesions were of pulmonary parenchymal
origin and 11 (44%) were of pleural origin. The number of cases in which the
pathologists postponed the diagnosis without making any approach was 14. Of
these, 9 (64%) were benign lesions such as bronchiectasis, fibrosis anthracosis, 
chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, chronic pleuritis, and mesothelial
proliferation. The number of misdiagnosed cases was 11. Of these, 7 (64%) were of
pulmonary and 4 (36%) were of pleural origin. Because the examination techniques 
of each pathology department may differ from one another, the comparative
examination of frozen sections and routine sections would aid in becoming
familiar with various pathologies and would be beneficial for pathologists in
minimizing their diagnostic errors.

Prior corticosteroid therapy presents a major challenge in the diagnosis of CNS
lymphomas, particularly in stereotactic biopsies. In this study we analysed the
cytological, histopathological and immunohistochemical features in stereotactic
biopsies of 25 primary CNS lymphoma cases pre-treated with corticosteroids. We
documented the extent and the frequency of each finding. We also investigated the
significance of subjectivity in evaluation of these biopsies in 3 seperate
sessions including the final diagnostic decision. In 48% of our cases the
diagnosis was straightforward. These cases were characterized by prominent blasts
either in diffuse paranchymal infiltrates or in perivascular regions. The
remaining 52% demonstrated some degree of variability among pathologists.
Lymphoid atypia other than the typical blastic morphology appeared as a
subjective finding and this was more pronounced in cytology preparations. In our 
study, corticosteroid pre-treatment in primary CNS lymphoma was associated with a
large spectrum of histopathological, immunohistochemical and cytological
findings. Combined use of an extended immunohistochemical panel would increase
the possibility of conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless some of these findings and 
therefore the diagnosis are open to subjectivity.

In April 2013, a symposium was organized to highlight different aspects of
differentiation and activation of the monocyte-macrophage lineage as analyzed on 
the flow cytometer. Characterization of this lineage requires knowledge of the
maturation process from their progenitors that are present in bone marrow up to
the mature monocytic cells in peripheral blood, because each monocytic lineage
cell with an aberrant phenotype refers to the corresponding maturation stage. A
standardized quantitative analysis will facilitate the monitoring of the
pathological processes and the clinical features, such as the outcome of
treatment. However, changes in marker expression by variation in intensity,
asynchronism, and lineage infidelity must be considered. The dynamics of normal
marker expressions in early differentiation stages, e.g. molecules like HLA II,
CD64 or CD14, give rise to a hypothesis on their possible role in monocyte
ontogeny. Besides their usual role in tissue homeostasis, mature macrophages may 
also play a similar role in hematopoiesis. This meeting highlighted the large
potential of flow cytometric tools available for monitoring of all these aspects 
in the monocytic and macrophage cell lineage. © 2015 International Clinical

AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in
chromatin remodeling which encodes ARID1A (BAF250a) protein. Recent studies have 
shown the loss of ARID1A expression in several types of tumors. This
retrospective study was designed to evaluate the differences in tissue
expressions of ARID1A in a spectrum of cervical neoplasms. Cervical
intraepithelial neoplasms, invasive squamous or adenosquamous carcinomas were
identified in 100 patients recently diagnosed as cervical neoplasms based on
pathology databases. In this series, there were 29 low- and 29 high-grade
cervical intraepithelial neoplasms, 27 squamous cell carcinomas, and 15
adenosquamous carcinomas. Mean age of the patients was 47.8 ± 13 years
(20-80 years). It was determined that the expression of ARID1A was statistically 
significantly down-regulated in adenosquamous carcinomas when compared with
non-invasive or invasive squamous cell carcinomas (p = 0.015). Lower levels of
the ARID1A expression were detected in cases with adenosquamous carcinomas (60%),
low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) (31%), and squamous cell
carcinomas (18.5%). Our findings have demonstrated the presence of a correlation 
between ARID1A expression and adenomatous differentiation of uterine squamous
cell carcinomas. Therefore, ARID1A gene may suggestively have a role in the
pathogenesis of cervical adenosquamous carcinomas.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological and apoptotic changes
occurring in the rat ipsilateral and contralateral testes, after experimental
spermatic cord torsion, and to explore and the role of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) cleavage in testicular torsion-detorsion injury. A total of 37 
Wistar albino rats were subjected to 720° unilateral spermatic cord torsion for
1, 2 and 4 h, followed by 4-h reperfusion, or else to a sham operation (control
group). Histology of the testicle was evaluated using haematoxylin-eosin (H&E)
staining and Johnsen's scoring system. Germ cell apoptosis was evaluated via
active caspase-3 immunostaining, and PARP expression levels were evaluated via
Western blotting. The mean Johnsen's tubular biopsy scores (JTBS) of the
ipsilateral testicles were lower for all torsion groups than for the controls (P 
< 0.05), but the JTBS of the contralateral testicles were only lower in the 4-h
torsion group (P < 0.05). The mean apoptosis score (AS) of the ipsilateral and
contralateral testicles was significantly higher in the torsion groups than in
the sham group. AS increased correlatively with torsion time, in both testicles. 
The effect of testicular torsion on PARP cleavage was time dependent, with the
highest effect observed after 4 h of testicular torsion (P < 0.05). Testicular
torsion caused time-dependent histological changes, apoptosis and increases in
PARP cleavage. Our results suggest that testicular torsion-detorsion injury
caused cell damage and germ cell apoptosis that apparently involved cleavage of
PARP. Increased PARP cleavage could, in turn, lead to enhanced apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Recently, there are several studies about cancer stem cells (CSC),
indicating that they are the cells that initiate the tumor, provide progression, 
metastasis and responsible for the aggressive tumor behavior.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study is to investigate the
expressions of CD24, CD44, their different combinations, ALDH1 and CD133 in
invasive ductal carcinoma. Their relationships with clinicopathologic parameters,
such as tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, axillary lymph node
involvement, stage, hormone receptors, HER2 expression, basal like tumors, triple
negative status and prognosis were also investigated. Tissue microarray method
was used to investigate ımmunohistochemical CD24, CD44, ALDH1 and CD133
expressions in 105 invasive ductal carcinoma cases.
RESULTS: CD133 expression was significantly associated with tumor size (p=0.023) 
and stage (p=0.009). CD133 expression was decreased in tumors with larger tumor
size, higher stage and lymphovascular invasion. CD133 expression was positively
correlated with CD44 (r=0.212, p=0.032) and CD44(+)/CD24(+) (r=0.202, p=0.040)
expressions. CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 expressions showed no significant relationship 
and correlation with clinicopathologic features. There was a significant
relationship (p=0.048) between CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype and basal like
tumors. EGFR expression was positively correlated with CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)
phenotype (r=0.211, p=0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: Basal like tumors are enriched for CSCs with CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)
phenotype. CD133 can detect a different population of CSC in breast carcinoma.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinctive lymphoma type generally characterized
by the presence of CCND1 translocation and overexpression of cyclin D1. MCL
usually presents with advanced stage and rapid clinical progression. The
diagnosis is in most instances uncomplicated but cases with variant morphologies 
or immunophenotypes, especially cyclin D1-negative cases, may cause diagnostic
difficulties. During the mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) session at the European
Association of Haematopathology/Society for Hematopathology workshop 2014 held in
Istanbul, Turkey, submitted cases illustrated interesting features such as
unusual morphology or immunophenotypes. In several submitted cases of cyclin
D1-positive MCL, CCND1 rearrangement could not be detected by t(11;14)(q13;q32)
dual-color dual-fusion FISH but was suggested by CCND1 break-apart probes, and
advantages and disadvantages of different FISH probes were highlighted. Three
cyclin D1-negative MCL cases were submitted. These were identified by SOX11
immunohistochemistry and found to carry CCND2 translocations and/or to express
high levels of cyclin D2 mRNA. Features associated with aggressive clinical
course were presented including high expression of p53 protein and MYC
aberrations. The need to integrate histological, immunophenotypic, genetic, and
clinical data to arrive at the correct diagnosis was emphasized.

BACKGROUND: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPPN) of the pancreas is a
distinctive tumor of low malignant potential with a predilection for female
patients in the second and third decades of life. We studied nine cases of SPPN
of the pancreas and reviewed the literature concerning these uncommon tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 7 cases of SPPN located in the tail of the
pancreas and two located in the head of the pancreas were presented. Distal
pancreatectomy in three patients and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy in
two patients Whipple's operation in four patients were performed. Histological
diagnosis was made by performing hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff
staining, immunohistochemical staining. Follow-up of the patients was between 2
months and 12 years.
RESULTS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were found as
equivocal for diagnosis. Mass containing cystic and solid areas were not
characteristic but raised suspicion of SPPN. Pathologic examination showed SPPN
in all patients. No metastasis or recurrence was detected during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm is a relatively rare tumor, and
patients tend to survive for a long period. Preoperative imaging is not
characteristic. Pathologic examination is the mainstay in the diagnosis. Complete
surgical removal is the best choice of treatment.

BACKGROUND: KIT and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade are important for
melanomagenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the frequency of BRAF, NRAS,
KIT, GNAQ and GNA11 gene mutations and investigated their association with
clinicopathological features of melanomas in Turkish population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven primary cutaneous melanomas were included in
our study. Sanger sequencing method was used for mutation analysis in all cases.
RESULTS: Mean age was 62.1 (29-101) years. Female:male ratio was 17:30. Among 47 
melanomas, 14 (29.8%) BRAF, 10 (21.3%) NRAS, 4 (8.5%) KIT and 1(2.1%) GNAQ gene
mutations were detected. Two of the KIT mutations were found in acral lentiginous
melanoma (ALM). In the head and neck region, mutation frequency was significantly
lower than in other locations (P = 0.035). The only GNAQ gene mutation (p.Q209L) 
was detected in a melanoma arising from blue nevus located on the scalp. None of 
the melanomas harbored NRAS exon 2, KIT exon 13/17/18, GNAQ exon 4 and GNA11 exon
4/5 mutations. Overall mutation frequency did not show significant difference
between metastatic (8/14, 57.1%) and nonmetastatic (18/33, 54.5%) patients. We
did not observe any significant association between mutation status and gender or
age of various patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that BRAF and NRAS gene mutations are common in 
cutaneous melanomas. The activating mutations of KIT gene are rare and especially
seen in ALM. GNAQ and GNA11 mutations are infrequent in cutaneous melanomas and
may be associated only with melanomas arising from blue nevus.

Cardiac contusion is usually caused by blunt chest trauma and, although it is
potentially a life-threatening condition, the diagnosis of a myocardial contusion
is difficult because of non-specific symptoms and the lack of an ideal test to
detect myocardial damage. Cardiac enzymes, such as creatine kinase (CK), creatine
kinase MB fraction (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTn-I), and cardiac troponin T
(cTn-T) were used in previous studies to demonstrate the blunt cardiac contusion 
(BCC). Each of these diagnostic tests alone is not effective for diagnosis of
BCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum heart-type fatty acid
binding protein (h-FABP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 
CK, CK-MB, and cTn-I levels as a marker of BCC in blunt chest trauma in rats. The
eighteen Wistar albino rats were randomly allocated to two groups; group I
(control) (n=8) and group II (blunt chest trauma) (n=10). Isolated BCC was
induced by the method described by Raghavendran et al. (2005). All rats were
observed in their cages and blood samples were collected after five hours of
trauma for the analysis of serum h-FABP, NT-pro BNP, CK, CK-MB, and cTn-I levels.
The mean serum NT-pro BNP was significantly different between group I and II
(10.3 ± 2.10 ng/L versus 15.4 ± 3.68 ng/L, respectively; P=0.0001). NT-pro BNP
level >13 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 70%, a positive
predictive value of 70%, and a negative predictive value of 87.5% for predicting 
blunt chest trauma (area under curve was 0.794 and P=0.037). There was no
significant difference between two groups in serum h-FABP, CK, CK-MB and c Tn-I
levels. A relation between NT-Pro BNP and BCC was shown in this study. Serum
NT-proBNP levels significantly increased with BCC after 5 hours of the blunt
chest trauma. The use of NT-proBNP as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests, such 
as troponins, electrocardiography (ECG), chest x-ray and echocardiogram may be
beneficial for diagnosis of BCC.

Urothelial Carcinoma with shadow cell, lipid cell and sebaceous (skin adnexal)
differentiation: Clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of 10 cases.

Behzatoğlu K(1).

Turkey. Electronic address: kbehzatoglu@hotmail.com.

We discuss the histological and immunohistochemical features of 6 cases of
urothelial carcinomas of lipid cell variant and 4 cases with shadow cell
differentiation, one of which showed additionally sebaceous differentiation, one 
of which shows additional sebaceous differentiation, from our archive cases from 
the last 15 years. Conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC) was seen in all lipid
cell variant cases, and micropapillary carcinoma was seen in 3. The ratio of the 
lipid cell component was between 10% and 40% in these 6 cases. Typical histologic
features of the lipid cell variant include lipoblast-like cells with a notched
nuclear appearance, abundant vacuoles, an eccentric nucleus, and pagetoid spread 
in some areas. GATA3 and pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunohistochemical staining were
positive in all cases. Adipophilin was positive in various degrees in 5 of the 6 
lipid cell variant cases but was also positive in the case with sebaceous
differentiation. α-methylacyl-CoA racemase was positive in the lipid cell areas
and negative or focal weakly positive in the conventional UC areas in 4 of the 6 
cases. Vimentin, S-100 protein, and PAX8 were negative in the lipid cell
component. Follow-up information was available for all cases with follow-up
ranging from 6 to 84 months (mean, 34 months). Four patients died of the disease.
One pT4 patient who had been followed up for 6 months lives with the disease,
whereas another is disease free. In conclusion, the lipid cell variant is a rare 
UC variant that usually presents at an advanced stage, and tumor cells are
histologically similar to lipoblasts, resemble sebaceous differentiation, and
show positive immunohistochemical staining with adipophilin.

Prophylactic lymph node dissection is still controversial due to the potentially 
surgery-related morbidity in management of papillary thyroid carcinomas. So, some
histopathological predictors for lymph node metastasis in thyroidectomy specimens
may reveal importance. The objective of this study was to define
histomorphological indicators of lymph node metastasis in the patients who had
been performed thyroidectomy without lymph node dissection. Clinicopathological
features of patients archived in Department of Pathology at Trakya University
Medical Faculty were reviewed. A total of 211 patients who had been diagnosed as 
papillary carcinoma and had been performed total thyroidectomy/lobectomy with
central/cervical lymph node dissection were included in the study. Clinical
features (age, gender, preoperative/postoperative clinical, and laboratory
findings) and histopathological features (histological variant, tumor size,
focality, extrathyroidal extension, tumor border, lateral tubular growth,
intraglandular dissemination, stromal and lymphocytic tumor response, lymphocytic
thyroiditis, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, number of metastatic
lymph nodes, extranodal extension, size of the metastatic foci) were evaluated.
Male gender, conventional variant, tumor size greater than 10 mm, multifocality, 
extrathyroidal extension, lateral tubular growth, intraglandular dissemination,
lymphocytic and stromal tumor response, and absence of lymphocytic thyroiditis
were predictive, and older age (≥45 years) and follicular variant PTC were
protective for lymph node metastasis. In order to optimize the management of
papillary thyroid carcinomas, pathologists should search for the clues of lymph
node metastasis particularly intraglandular dissemination, lateral tubular
growth, tumor border and lymphocytic/stromal tumor response, multifocality,
concomitant lymphocytic thyroiditis besides the actual prognostic criteria
especially in younger aged male patients.

Sustained plasma progesterone (P4) levels suggest initiation of human term labor 
by functional P4 withdrawal, reflecting reduced progesterone receptor (PR) and/or
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression or activity. The steroid-induced
immunophilin cochaperone FKBP51 inhibits PR- and GR-mediated transcription,
suggesting a labor-initiating role. Gestational age-matched decidual sections
were immunostained for FKBP51 and decidual cell (DC) and interstitial trophoblast
(IT) markers, vimentin and cytokeratin, respectively. Term DC cultures were
incubated with vehicle (control), estradiol (E2) with or without
medroxyprogesterone acetate, dexamethasone (Dex), or Organon 2058. FKBP51
histologic scoring was significantly higher in DC nuclei during labor versus
prelabor decidua, whereas FKBP51 immunostaining was undetected in interstitial
trophoblasts (P < 0.05). In term DC cultures, E2 + medroxyprogesterone acetate or
E2 + Dex enhanced FKBP51 expression (P < 0.01), whereas E2 + Organon 2058
inhibited PR expression (P < 0.05), and E2 + Dex inhibited GR expression (P <
0.05). Unlike term DCs, FKBP51 was undetected in control or Dex-treated cultured 
third-trimester trophoblasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that
FKPB51 overexpression or silencing in cultured DCs altered PR-DNA binding.
Increased FKBP51 levels in term DCs during labor complement our prior in situ
observations of significantly lower PR in labor versus prelabor DCs. In a milieu 
of sustained plasma P4 levels, these reciprocal changes will amplify functional
P4 withdrawal in DCs via FKBP51-mediated PR resistance coupled with declining PR 
levels, whereas the lack of FKBP51 expression in interstitial trophoblasts
suggests unopposed constitutive GR action.

Ossifying fibroma of the jaw is a benign fibroosseous tumour. The growth of it is
slowly and it is well circumscribed. Occurrence of multiple ossifying fibromas
(synchronous) is rare in the jaw, and only a few cases have been documented. The 
most of these cases were in only maxilla. The fewer cases were reported in both
of maxilla and mandible. We report a case of bilateral synchronous ossifying
fibromas involving the mandible of a 37 years old male. The importance of our
case is that bilaterality and synchronous of the lesions. Our case is the first
synchronous mandibler lesion in literature reported.

Endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma (EEC) developing on the ground of
endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is amongst the most commonly observed type of cancer
in the world. Folate receptor α (FRα) is a vitamin molecule that has a role in
cell proliferation. The fact that FRα, which is known to be needed extremely by
the cells of malignancies that proliferate rapidly, is present in limited amounts
in normal tissues while it is overexpressed in malignant cells of the same
tissues makes folate a candidate for target molecular therapy. In our study, FRα 
expression in 214 cases, with 95 diagnosed within EEC and 119 with EH, was
studied immunohistochemically. FRα expression in EEC was found significantly high
compared to EH and normal endometrium (P<0.01). Similarly, FRα expression in EH
cases with complex atypia were significantly high compared to other hyperplasia
subgroups (P<0.01). The findings of our results make us think that FRα
overexpression may play a role in the EEC carcinogenesis and carcinoma
progression from EH. Furthermore, we suggest that it can be helpful in the
treatment of EEC and/or transition from hyperplasia stage to EEC as a molecular
therapy targeting receptors labeled with antibody-based props containing FRα.
Finally, we suggest that FRα may be used, based on the expression intensity, as a
supplemental option to determine the patients that shall be directed to radical
therapy amongst patients with complex atypical EH.

The aim of this study is to determine the expression level of spindle assembly
checkpoint (SAC) proteins-BubR1 and synuclein-gamma (SNCG) in human breast cancer
tissues and to test whether there is a relationship between their expression
levels and clinicopathologic parameters including respons to taxanes, tumor
grade, estrogen receptor (ER) pozitivity, HER2 status, and overall survival (OS).
We analyzed retrospectively paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 55 breast
cancer patients whose clinical outcomes had been tracked after taxane treatment
in neoadjuvan and metastatic setting. The expression status of BubR1 and SNCG was
defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the anti-BubR1 and anti-SNCG
antibody. The BubR1 and SNCG was overexpressed in 38% and 62% of the study group,
respectively. There was borderline significant correlation between low BubR1
expression and increased taxane sensitivity (P=0.05). In contrast, high SNCG
expression was significantly associated with decreased taxane sensitivity
(P=0.01). There was no association between the clinicopathologic parameters
including histologic grade, ER positivity and HER2 status and the level of these 
proteins. However, triple negative tumors showed significantly more high BubR1
expression than those other molecular subtypes (P=0.04). Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis failed to show a significant correlation between expression levels of
BubR1 and SNCG and overall survival although patients with low levels of both
proteins had a marginally longer survival time compared to those with high
levels. In summary, our data suggest that both BubR1 and SNCG may be promising
predictive marker rather than prognostic marker in patients with breast cancer.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast is a rare variant of breast
malignancy and is associated with an excellent prognosis. ACC accounts for 0.1%
of all breast carcinomas. It has favorable biological characteristics and an
excellent prognosis. A 77-year-old woman presented with a lump in the right
breast. Ultrasonography and mammography showed a 12-mm, well-defined, lobulated
mass in the retroareolar region of the right breast. The lump was diagnosed as
ACC on the basis of immunohistochemical staining results for c-kit (CD117),
muscle-specific actin, p63, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor using a 
fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) specimen. This diagnosis was subsequently 
confirmed by excision biopsy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
case of ACC of the breast to date to be diagnosed on the basis of
immunohistochemical staining of an FNAC cell block material. From our experience,
we recommend the usage of cell block material for immunohistochemical studies to 
accurately diagnose ACC of the breast.

Comparative analysis of cervical cytology screening methods and staining
protocols for detection rate and accurate interpretation of ASC-H: Data from a
high-volume laboratory in Turkey.

Ozlem A(1), Umit I(1).

Author information: 
(1)Acibadem University, Medical School, Department of Pathology, Istanbul,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the ThinPrep(®) Imaging
System (TIS) and ThinPrep(®) Pap Stain (TPPS). A comparative analysis was
conducted to determine the detection rates of atypical squamous cells, cannot
exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), the ASC:squamous
intraepithelial lesion (SIL) ratio, biopsy follow-up for ASC-H in terms of the
screening method used (manual screening [MS] vs. TIS screening [TISS]) and the
staining protocol (regular Pap stain [RPS] vs. TPPS).
METHODS: This study was performed over two periods. The RPS period included
manually screened slides, whereas the TPPS period included TIS + manually
screened slides. All data from the study periods were compared using statistical 
analysis.
RESULTS: The detection rate of ASC-H was significantly higher during the TPPS
period than during the RPS period (0.49% vs. 0.23%); this finding is in contrast 
to the insignificant difference between the screening method periods. The
positive predictive value (PPV) of ASC-H cytodiagnosis for cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or more severe histologies was significantly
different between manually screened and TIS slides (22.10% vs. 38.55%), in
contrast to an insignificant difference between RPS and TPPS periods (37.14% vs. 
29.77%).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of the TIS did not change the ASC-H detection rates
appreciably. However, the new technology improved PPV for ASC-H cytodiagnosis and
enabled the detection of true disease. Our laboratory statistics indicate that
the TPPS is not a superior staining protocol and did not increase our diagnostic 
accuracy for ASC-H compared with RPS.

Sur1-Trpm4 Cation Channel Expression in Human Cerebral Infarcts.

Mehta RI(1), Tosun C, Ivanova S, Tsymbalyuk N, Famakin BM, Kwon MS, Castellani
RJ, Gerzanich V, Simard JM.

VG, JMS), Neurology (BMF), and Physiology (JMS), University of Maryland School of
Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; and the Department of Molecular Biology and
Genetics (CT), Izmir Institute of Technology, Izmir, Turkey.

The nonselective monovalent cation channel transient receptor potential
melastatin 4 (Trpm4) is transcriptionally upregulated in neural and vascular
cells in animal models of brain infarction. It associates with sulfonylurea
receptor 1 (Sur1) to form Sur1-Trpm4 channels, which have critical roles in
cytotoxic edema, cell death, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and vasogenic edema. 
We examined Trpm4 expression in postmortem brain specimens from 15 patients who
died within the first 31 days of the onset of focal cerebral ischemia. We found
increased Trpm4 protein expression in all cases using immunohistochemistry;
transcriptional upregulation was confirmed using in situ hybridization of Trpm4
messenger RNA. Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 colocalized and
coassociated with Sur1 within ischemic endothelial cells and neurons.
Coexpression of Sur1 and Trpm4 in necrotic endothelial cells was also associated 
with vasogenic edema indicated by upregulated perivascular tumor necrosis factor,
extravasation of serum immunoglobulin G, and associated inflammation. Upregulated
Trpm4 protein was present up to 1 month after the onset of cerebral ischemia. In 
a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke, pharmacologic channel
blockade by glibenclamide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor,
mitigated perivascular tumor necrosis factor labeling. Thus, upregulated
Sur1-Trpm4 channels and associated blood-brain barrier disruption and cerebral
edema suggest that pharmacologic targeting of this channel may represent a
promising therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of patients with
cerebral ischemia.

AIM: To determine the impact of gene polymorphisms on detrusor
contraction-relaxation harmony in children with lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Toilet trained children older than 5 years of age with
LUTS and normal neurological examination underwent videourodynamic study. The
control group was composed of age matched children with no voiding complaints.
The study group who filled out the voiding dysfunction symptom score before and
after the treatment received standard oxybutynin treatment and was reevaluated 1 
year after treatment. Genomic DNA was isolated from all patients and subjected to
PCR for amplification. Genotyping of ARGHEF10, ROCK2, ADRB3, and CYP3A4 was
carried out with Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
RESULTS: 34 (45%) and 42 (55%) patients were enrolled in the study and control
group, respectively. ARGEF10 GG, ADRB3 TC, and CYP3A4 AG genotype patients
displayed insignificant difference between pre- and posttreatment voiding
dysfunction symptom score and bladder volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism of genes in the cholinergic pathway did not
significantly differ clinical parameters. On the other hand, polymorphic patients
in the adrenergic pathway seemed to suffer from clinical disappointment. For this
reason, we think that the neglected adrenergic pathway could be a new therapeutic
target for the treatment of anticholinergic resistant LUTS in children.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of zinc-dependent peptidases that
participate in matrix turnover in solid malignancies. The aim of this study was
twofold. First, we sought to investigate under a case-control design the
association between the functional -1562C/T polymorphism in the promoter region
of MMP-9 and gastric cancer (GC) in a Turkish sample. Second, we examined its
prognostic significance in GC patients. A total of 144 subjects were enrolled in 
the case-control study (79 GC cases and 65 controls). Overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) served as the main outcome measures in the
longitudinal study. The MMP-9 -1562C/T polymorphism was genotyped using a
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The
odds ratio (OR) of GC for the CC genotype relative to the CT+TT genotypes was not
significant (OR = 0.89, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.44-1.82, P = 0.75).
These results did not change after allowance for age and sex in multivariable
regression analysis (OR = 0.81, 95 % CI = 0.40-1.94, P = 0.84). When the MMP-9
-1562C/T polymorphism was analyzed among GC patients in relation to OS and PFS,
we found no significant differences between subjects with the CC and CT+TT
genotypes. In conclusion, the results of our study did not point toward a major
role of the MMP-9 -1562C/T polymorphism in the pathogenesis and clinical course
of GC in Turkish subjects.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the cytomorphometric and
morphological effects of Trichomonas vaginalis in exfoliated epithelial cells.
STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-six Pap-stained cervical smears were divided into a study
group and two control groups as follows: T. vaginalis cases, a first control
group with inflammation, and a second control group without inflammation.
Micronucleated, binucleated, karyorrhectic, karyolytic, and karyopyknotic cells
and cells with perinuclear halos per 1,000 epithelial cells were counted. Nuclear
and cellular areas were evaluated in 70 clearly defined cells in each smear using
image analysis.
RESULTS: The frequencies of morphological parameters in the T. vaginalis cases
were higher than the values of the two control groups, and the difference among
groups was found to be significant (p < 0.05). The nuclear and cytoplasmic areas 
of epithelial cells were diminished in patients with trichomoniasis. The mean
nucleus/cytoplasm ratio in T. vaginalis patients was higher than the value in the
control groups, and the difference between the study group and control group 1
was significant. However, there was no statistically significant increase between
the study group and control group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: T. vaginalis exhibited significant changes in the cellular size and 
nuclear structure of the cells. The rising frequency of micronuclei, nuclear
abnormalities, and changing nucleus/cytoplasm ratio may reflect genotoxic damage 
in trichomoniasis.

Colorectal cancers are the third most common in both sexes and they are the
second most common cause of cancer-related death. 12-15% of colorectal cancers
develop through microsatellite instability (the hereditary mutation in at least
one of DNA mismatch repair genes) pathway and they are 2-5% hereditary. In this
study, we investigated the correlation between the clinicopathological features
themselves and also the correlation between them and the immunohistochemical
MLH-1, MSH-2, PMS-2, MSH-6 expressions in a total of 186 resection materials with
colorectal adenocarcinoma between 2008 and 2012. All the cases were
retrospectively evaluated in terms of age, sex, localization, size, accompanying 
polyp, multiple tumor, arising from polyp, differentiation, mucinous
differentiation, pathological tumor stage, lymphovascular and perineural
invasion, lymphocyte amount in the tumor microenvironment, surgical border and
lymph node metastasis. We prepared multiple tissue blocks which had 4-millimeter 
tumor. Immunohistochemically, MLH-1, MSH-2, PMS-2, MSH-6 primary antibodies were 
studied. Statistically, "Kruskal-Wallis" ve "Pearson's chi-squared" tests were
used. We found a positive correlation between loss of MLH-1 and PMS-2 expressions
and the right-colon location, poor and mucinous differentiation and dense
lymphocytic infiltration. In addition, loss of MSH-2 and MSH-6 expressions was
correlated with the right-colon location, poor and mucinous differentiation. We
found a meaningful relationship between immunohistochemical markers and
clinicopathological features usually observed in tumors with microsatellite
instability. This finding may arouse suspicion for MSI. However, the findings in 
our study must be supported with studies conducted in large series including
molecular methods.

Wilson's disease (WD), also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, was first
described in 1912 by Kinnear Wilson. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused
by mutations in the ATP7B gene, a membrane-bound copper transporting ATPase. The 
disorder is caused by impairment of the copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B, in the
liver, which disturbs copper transport, excretion into the bile, and
incorporation into apoceruloplasmin. WD is an inherited copper metabolism
disorder with pathological copper accumulation in many tissues, but especially in
brain and liver. We conducted this study because copper accumulation in oral
tissues in patients with WD have not been studied before. We think that copper
accumulation and differences of oxidative events in oral tissues can cause
tendency to periodontal diseases.

INTRODUCTION: The pathological diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is 
generally easy on routine sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
However, the differentiation of the follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC) from other 
suspected follicular-patterned lesions of the thyroid is highly difficult. Among 
these, the lesions for which FVPTC cannot be excluded are classified as
well-differentiated tumors of uncertain malignant potential (WDT-UMP). The most
common immunohistochemical (IHC) markers used in the differential diagnosis
include HBME-1, galectin-3, and CK19. However, none of these markers provide a
100% differential diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: The present study compared the diagnostic value of CD56 and E-cadherin
for the differentiation of FVPTC from the other benign follicular-patterned
lesions, with HBME-1, galectin-3, and CK19. Using these markers, the
controversial cases within the WDT-UMP group were reclassified. Additionally, the
relationship between the reductions in E-cadherin expression with poor prognostic
factors was investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IHC expressions of CD56, E-cadherin, HBME-1,
galectin-3, and CK19 were evaluated in 181 thyroid lesions, including 101 PTCs
(45 classical variant PTCs and 56 FVPTCs), 20 WDT-UMPs, 20 follicular adenomas
(FAs), 20 hyperplastic nodules (HN), and 20 hyperplastic foci of lymphocytic
thyroiditis. The results were statistically compared via SPSS.
RESULTS: The expressions of all of the markers were statistically significantly
different in PTC and follicular-patterned lesions (P<0.05). It was found that the
only marker with both sensitivity and specificity above 90% was CD56 negativity
(sensitivity 91.1%, specificity 91.7%). The most sensitive and also the most
specific double panel was CD56 negativity and galectin-3 positivity (sensitivity 
96%, specificity 85%), and the most sensitive and specific triple panel was CD56 
negativity, HBME-1 positivity, and galectin-3 positivity (97% and 70%,
respectively).

Because of the presence of various overlapping findings, the discrimination of
polycythemia vera (PV) from prefibrotic/fibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PF/F-PMF)
and essential thrombocythemia (ET) may be challenging, particularly in suboptimal
bone marrow biopsy specimens. In this study, we assessed whether differences in
the expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2), nerve growth factor
receptor (NGFR; CD271), CD34, CD68, p53, CD3, CD20, and CD138 by
immunohistochemistry could be useful in separating among them. Higher frequencies
of nuclear positive erythroblasts with NF-E2 were observed in ET and PV cases
(50% ± 13.3% and 41.5% ± 9.4%, respectively) when compared with both PF-PMF (21% 
± 11.7%) and F-PMF (28.5% ± 10.8%). We found that with a cutoff level of at least
30% nuclear staining for NF-E2 in erythroblasts, we could reliably exclude the
possibility of PMF. Conversely, NGFR+ stromal cells per high-power field (HPF)
was significantly increased in F-PMF (53.5 ± 19.1/HPF) and PF-PMF (13.5 ±
3.8/HPF) compared with ET (4.4 ± 2.2/HPF) and PV (6.6 ± 3.3/HPF). Similarly,
differences in CD34-microvessel density was remarkable in F-PMF and PF-PMF cases 
in comparison with PV and ET (49.9 ± 12.1/HPF, 29.3 ± 12.4/HPF, 13.7 ± 4.6/HPF,
and 11.9 ± 5.1/HPF, respectively). Thus, the assessment of NF-E2 and NGFR
expression and the evaluation of CD34-microvessel density may provide additional 
support in reaching a correct diagnosis in these cases of myeloproliferative
neoplasms.

Pathogenesis of Behçet's disease: autoinflammatory features and beyond.

Behçet's disease (BD) is an inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology
characterised by recurrent attacks affecting the mucocutaneous tissues, eyes,
joints, blood vessels, brain and gastrointestinal tract. It is a multifactorial
disease classified as a variable vessel vasculitis, and several environmental
triggers may induce inflammatory episodes in genetically susceptible individuals.
BD has several autoinflammatory features including recurrent self-limited
clinical manifestations overlapping with monogenic autoinflammatory disorders,
significant host predisposition and abnormally increased inflammatory response,
with a robust innate component. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 is the
strongest susceptibility factor described so far affecting the disease risk and
typical phenotype. Non-HLA genetic associations such as endoplasmic reticulum
aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) and IL10 variations
suggest that BD shares susceptibility genes and inflammatory pathways with
spondyloarthritis. Although genomewide association studies revealed an increased 
risk associated with recessively inherited ERAP1 variations in HLA-B*51 positive 
patients, it is not clear yet whether certain peptide-HLA allele combinations
result in an adaptive response by a self-antigen-directed cytotoxic response or
an innate response by modulating an NK cell activity or causing an unfolded
protein response. Understanding of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class
I-driven inflammatory response is expected to provide insights for the
development of better treatment and remission-induction options in BD as well as 
in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriasis.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an agressive subtype accounts nearly 15 %
of all breast carcinomas. Conventional chemotherapy is the only treatment
modality thus new, effective targeted therapy methods have been investigated.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors give hope according to the
recent studies results. Also therapeutic agents have been tried against aberrant 
p53 signal activity as TNBC show high p53 mutation rates. Our aim was to detect
the incidence of mutations/amplifications identified in TNBC in our population.
Here we used sequence analysis to detect HER2 (exon 18-23), p53 (exon 5-8)
mutations; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method to analyse
EGFR/chromosome 7 centromere gene status in 82 immunohistochemically TNBC.
Basaloid phenotype was identified in 49 (59.8 %) patients. EGFR amplification was
noted in 5 cases (6.1 %). All EGFR amplified cases showed EGFR overexpression by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). p53 mutations were identified in 33 (40.2 %) cases.
Almost 60 % of the basal like breast cancer cases showed p53 mutation. Only one
case showed HER2 mutation (exon 20:g.36830_3). Our results showed that gene
amplification is not the unique mechanism in EGFR overexpression. IHC might be
used in the decision of anti-EGFR therapy in routine practice. p53 mutation rate 
was lower than the rates reported in the literature probably due to ethnic
differences and low sensitivity of sanger sequences in general mutation
screening. We also established the rarity of HER2 mutation in TNBC. In conclusion
EGFR and p53 are the major targets in TNBC also for our population.

Intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome (IAH/ACS) are
life-threatening conditions and caused by several clinical status. Although there
is insufficient data regarding its effects on adrenal glands. This study aimed to
identify whether elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) caused any alteration on
the morphology and function of adrenal glands in a rat model. Twenty four
Sprague-Dawley male rats were included in the study. Animals were allocated into 
4 groups. IAP was elevated to 15 mmHg for one hour and four hours in group 2 and 
4. Group 1 and 3 were sham groups. Blood samples were taken for the assessment of
plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, and corticosterone levels and adrenalectomies
were performed to evaluate apoptosis. Blood adrenaline, noradrenaline and
corticosterone levels were significantly higher in the study groups compared with
the sham groups. However, there were no significant changes in apoptotic index
scores in the study groups as compared to sham groups. These results support that
increased IAH leads to discharge of catecholamine and corticosterone from the
adrenal glands. Failure to demonstrate similar changes in apoptotic index score
may be concluded as apoptosis is not a leading pathway for impairment of adrenal 
glands during IAH period.

Current methods for diagnosis and staging of prostate adenocarcinoma are not
sensitive enough to distinguish between patients with indolent disease and those 
that should receive radical treatment. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a well-characterized process involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. The aim
of this study is to analyze the expression of β-catenin, Snail, and E-cadherin in
prostate cancer patients with prospective evaluation of their value in predicting
disease-free survival (DFS). One-hundred-and-three consecutive prostate carcinoma
patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and 35 patients with benign prostate
hyperplasia (BPH) were enrolled. Age, initial PSA level, tumor size and clinical 
stage were documented for adenocarcinoma patients and they were enrolled in
active surveillance with serum PSA levels. Recurrence was defined as PSA level of
≥ 0.2 ng/ml on at least 2 occasions over a 2-month period. Immunohistochemical
staining intensity was scored as negative, weakly positive, moderately positive, 
and strongly positive. For Snail and β-catenin immunoreaction, the tumors were
considered nuclear positive when more than 5 % of the nuclei of tumor cells were 
positively stained. Patients with prostate cancer had weaker β-catenin (p <
0.0001), Snail (p = 0.006), and E-cadherin (p = 0.02) staining when compared to
BPH patients and the frequency of nuclear positivity for β-catenin and Snail were
higher in adenocarcinoma group (p < 0.0001). Increased expression and nuclear
positivity of β-catenin were associated with advanced stage (p = 0.012 and p =
0.003) and higher tumor volume (p = 0.013 and p = 0.002). Additionally, patients 
with increased Snail expression had higher Gleason scores and tumor volume at
presentation (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004). However, there were no significant DFS
differences in adenocarcinoma patients who did and did not have β-catenin, Snail,
and E-cadherin expression as assessed with log-rank test. Expressions of
β-catenin, Snail, and E-cadherin were significantly lower in prostate cancer
patients compared to BPH patients and both β-catenin and Snail had nuclear
staining pattern in patients with adenocarcinoma. However, none of these markers 
predicted DFS in 36-month follow up of our cohort.

The most significant adverse effect of inhaled steroid administration in children
is suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsiveness and
suppression of growth. This study evaluates the effects of inhaled
corticosteroids on the growth plates in infant rats. Rats aged 10 days were
divided into five groups. Low and high doses of budesonide and fluticasone
propionate (50-200-250 mcg/day) were applied with a modified spacer for 10 days. 
The rat's tibias were then removed and the effects of the steroids on the growth 
plates were compared. Growth cartilage chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis
rates; IGF-1 and glucocorticoid receptor levels; and resting, proliferative,
hypertrophic, and total zone (TZ) measurements were compared using
immunohistochemical-staining methods. With high doses of fluticasone, growth
plates were affected much more than with high doses of budesonide (p = 0.01).
Fluticasone, particularly at a dose of 250 mcg, inhibited the growth plate with
an intensive negative impact on all parameters.

Fetal sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) occur in one to two per 20 000 pregnancies 
that cause high-output cardiac failure. High-output cardiac failure leads to
polyhydramnios, hydrops, intrauterine fetal demise and preterm birth. Vascular
disruption defects refer to those involving the interruption or destruction of
some part of the fetal vasculature. We present a rare case of huge SCT causing
multiple fetal disruption defects like cleft lip and palate and limb anomalies
besides hydrops.

There are many scoring methods evaluating the expression of p16 in the bladder
immunohistochemically. In this study our aim was to determine an optimal p16
scoring method by discussing different staining methods related with p16
expression in bladder cancers and to establish the association of p16 and Ki-67
expressions, alone or in combination, with recurrence and progression. Ninety
patients undergoing their first transurethral resection for bladder cancer and
newly diagnosed papillary urothelial carcinoma (pTa and pT1) were included in the
study. Four different scoring methods were used for p16 (p16a, p16b, p16c, p16d).
The patients were divided into two groups based on recurrence and progression.
There was a statistically significant difference between recurrence and abnormal 
p16d staining (p = 0.005). In other staining patterns of p16, there was no
statistically significant difference in terms of recurrence or progression.In the
multivariate logistic regression analysis, combined Ki-67 ≥ 10 and abnormal p16d 
staining was found to be the only independent predictive factor for recurrence
(OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 0.13-46.41, p = 0.035) and no independent predictive factor
for progression was found. Determining an adequate expression scoring by taking
normal transitional epithelial staining pattern as a reference would be an
objective approach in p16 evaluation. Moreover, it was found that evaluating p16d
and Ki-67 in combination would be significant in predicting recurrence in pTa and
pT1 urothelial carcinomas.

The number of cases with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is
considered to be being underestimated because of a large amount of SCAD leading
to sudden death without previous diagnosis. Besides, not only in clinics but also
in autopsy practice, correct diagnosis of SCAD is important to prevent forensic
malpractice.The article is intended to discuss the pathological findings through 
the forensic point of view for improving the malpractice expertise in scope of
clinicians' timely antemortem diagnosis according to risk factors and in scope of
forensic pathologists' the cause of death determination ability according to
macroscopical and microscopical findings of the autopsy.In 3 cases reported, the 
main characteristics were the female sex, pregnancy history and a sudden death
without any trauma. However, although there are many women giving birth or using 
oral contraceptives, only some of them are facing with SCAD. This suggests the
possibility of some hereditary factors, whereas hereditary characteristics may be
understood in many different ways like hormone-releasing regulating mechanisms as
well as immunity, morphology, or any other mechanism. For instance, autoimmunity 
has been also a hereditary underlying factor for vessel injury considered in
presented cases.

The focus of this study was to investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
expression by immunohistochemistry using a highly specific antibody. Distribution
and frequency of ALK expression may provide a clue for ALK inhibitor use in small
round cell tumors of childhood. The study group involved 76 small round cell
tumors of childhood, which composed of 11 rhabdomyosarcomas, 13 Wilms tumors, 7
Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 34 peripheral neuroblastic
tumors, and 11 acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein
expression in small round cell tumors of childhood is poorly described in the
literature. The findings of our study highlight a potential and possible role of 
targeting ALK in pediatric solid tumors by using ALK immunohistochemistry.
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase may also have an oncogenic role in rhabdomyosarcomas
and peripheral neuroblastic tumors, and they may possibly be treated with ALK
inhibitors. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase expression in Wilms tumors is not reported
in the literature, previously. Our study evaluated ALK expression in Wilms tumor 
samples.

The phenomenon of feta-maternal microchimerisms inspires numerous questions. Many
questions remain to be answered regarding this new avenue of genetics. The X and 
Y chromosomes have been associated with malignancy in different types of human
tumors. We aimed to investigate the numerical aberrations of chromosomes X and Y 
in lung cancer (LC) and bladder cancer (BC) and review recent evidence for
possible roles of microchimeric cells (McCs) in these cancers. We carried out
cytogenetic analysis of the tumor and blood sampling in 52 cases of people with
BC and LC, and also with 30 healthy people. A total of 48 (92.3 %) of the
patients revealed sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). A total SCAs was found in
9.8 % of 2282 cells that were analyzed as one or more cells in each case. The 68 
and 95 SCAs were found in the 1952 (8.4 %) cells in peripheral blood, and 41 and 
19 SCAs in the 330 (18.2 %) cells in the tumoral tissues respectively. There was 
a significant difference in the frequencies of SCAs between the patients and the 
control groups determined by the Fischer's Exact Test (p < 0.0001). The
frequencies of SCAs were higher in the tumoral tissues than in the blood (p <
0.0001). There was a significant difference in the frequencies of SCAs between
the tumor and blood tissues, and this was higher in the tumor tissue (p <
0.0001). In general, 78.9 % (41) of the 52 patients with LC and BC had X and Y
chromosome monosomies. Largely a Y chromosome loss was present in 77.8 % of the
men, and the 47, XXY karyotype was found in 33.3 % of them. The second most
common SCA was monosomy X, and was found in 71.4 % of the women. McCs were
observed in 26.9 % of the 52 patients, and the frequencies of McCs were higher in
the blood than in the tissues (p < 0.0001). XY cells were identified in the lung 
and bladder tissues of the women who had been pregnant with boys, but not in
those who had not. There was a significant difference in the frequencies of McCs 
between the LC and BC patients (p < 0.0005). We speculate that the microchimerism
could have a general beneficial role in cancer, in which some sites may not be
evident because of an allogeneic maternal immune reaction that hastens cancer
development. A further understanding of McCs may help in anticipating its
implications in cancer. Our results may suggest that SCAs may be contributing
factors in the development of LC and BC, and aneuploidies of X and Y chromosomes 
play a role in the pathogenesis of cancers.

OBJECTIVE: Candida is the most common cause of fungal infections. The aim of this
study was to fill the gaps in the current knowledge on the frequencies of
micronuclei and nuclear anomalies, and the nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio in genital
candidiasis.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 88 Papanicolaou- stained cervical smears, which
comprised Candida spp. (n = 44) and control cases with no infectious agent (n =
44), were studied. In each smear, cells with micronuclei and nuclear anomalies
were counted in 1,000 epithelial cells and also nuclear and cellular areas were
evaluated using image analysis software at a magnification of ×400.
RESULTS: The frequencies of micronucleated and binucleated cells and cells with
perinuclear halos, and the nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio of epithelial cells were
higher in the Candida-infected group compared with the control group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Genital candidiasis is able to induce changes in the size and shape 
of epithelial cells. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and the frequency of
micronuclei may reflect the DNA damage in the cervical epithelium. Micronucleus
scoring could be used to screen the genomic damage profile of epithelial cells in
candidiasis.

A 1.5-month-old Kangal breed puppy from a dairy cattle farm died after showing
severe diarrhoea and incoordination. Necropsy examination revealed multifocal
pulmonary consolidation and necrosis and fibrinohaemorrhagic enteritis.
Microscopically, there was necrotic and purulent bronchopneumonia, myocarditis
and non-purulent encephalitis. In the jejunum and ileum there was villous atrophy
and crypt hyperplasia with oocyst-like and schizont-like structures in the
epithelia. Immunohistochemically, Neospora caninum antigen was detected in
association with the intestinal protozoal structures, degenerative neurons and
areas of necrosis in the lungs and heart. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed
that the organism was N. caninum and not Toxoplasma gondii. The seroprevalence
for N. caninum was 74.2% (49/66 animals) for the cattle and 57.1% (4/7 animals)
for dogs on this farm. This report documents fatal systemic neosporosis and
enteroepithelial stages of N. caninum in a naturally infected puppy. To the
authors' knowledge, this is the first definition of intestinal neosporosis in a
naturally infected dog as well as the first evidence of fatal canine neosporosis 
in Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a systemic inflammatory disease. We
aimed to detect whether there was a change of mean platelet volume (MPV) level on
onset and remission patients with biliary and non-biliary acute pancreatitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our emergency service patients diagnosed with biliary
and nonbiliary AP were analyzed retrospectively. Laboratory results measured in
onset and remission were recorded and compared.
RESULTS: Total number of patients enrolled in our study was 331 (177 female). 194
cases were classified as biliary and 137 were as non-biliary AP. Average age and 
numbers of female patients of biliary cases were higher than that of nonbiliary
cases. Initial MPV values were lower than remission values in all patients with
AP. In biliary group initial MPV was 8.42 ± 1.04 and remission value was 8.71 ±
1.12. In nonbiliary group initial MPV was 8.07 ± 1.02 and remission value was 8.4
± 1.06. In both groups on onset had lower mean MPV levels than those in remission
(P = 0.0001 both of them).
CONCLUSIONS: MPV values were higher than initial values in remission period in
patients both of groups. MPV was lower in non-biliary AP group than biliary AP
group that can be an indicator of early-onset infection.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects
approximately 1% of the world's population. The pathogenesis of RA is not
understood fully. It is assumed that endothelial function is associated with the 
proinflammatory state of RA. Endothelial dysfunction/activation reflects the
increased level of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and a shift toward prothrombotic
activity of the endothelium. The present study was performed to investigate the
possible relationships between vWF and claudin-5 and the level of disease
activity in patients with RA. The study population was divided into four groups
according to the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28): remission group
(RG), 18 patients (DAS28 < 2.6); low disease activity group (LDAG), 23 patients
(DAS28 > 2.6-3.2); moderate disease activity (MDAG), 23 patients (DAS28 >
3.2-5.1); high disease activity group (HDAG), 14 patients (DAS28 > 5.1); and
control group (CG), 10 healthy subjects. Claudin-5 and vWF assessment were
derived from serum samples gathered from the patients known to have RF and
anti-CCP titers in the normal ranges. A high positive association of claudin-5
and vWF with the MDAG was observed (P < 0.001). The results of our study
indicated that the relationship between vWF and claudin-5, which are indicators
of endothelial cell dysfunction and tight junction activity, may be a predictor
of disease activity. Further studies are required to investigate these pathways
to shed light on the roles of claudin-5 and vWF in the progression of
inflammation and other vascular conditions.

The aim of this study was to investigate the myotoxic effects of bupivacaine,
ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine which were applied intramuscularly to rat
skeletal muscle. Forty Wistar-Albino rats were divided into four groups. In the
study, .5% bupivacaine (Group B), .5% ropivacaine (Group R), .5% levobupivacaine 
(Group L), or .9% normal saline (Group SF) was applied intramuscularly to the
right gastrocnemius muscle of rats. The rats in each group were sacrificed on the
second day after injection. Sections of muscle samples were stained with
hematoxylin-eosin for light microscopic investigation and prepared for the
evaluation of ultrastructural changes in the subcellular level with transmission 
electron microscopy. All three local anesthetic agents caused qualitatively
similar skeletal muscle damage. The most observed muscle damage was in Group B,
muscle damage of Group R was less than that of Group B, and the least damage was 
seen in Group L quantitatively. Electron microscopic examination of each group
that caused cellular damage was qualitatively similar. The most subcellular
damage was observed in the group receiving bupivacaine, less was seen in the
ropivacaine group, and the least was observed in the levobupivacaine group. The
results indicated that bupivacaine caused more myotoxic damage than the other two
agents in the skeletal muscle of rats and that levobupivacaine caused less
myotoxic damage than both bupivacaine and ropivacaine at the cell and tissue
levels.

Acquired periungual fibrokeratomas are benign fibrous tissue tumors and are
considered as the topographical variant of acquired digital fibrokeratoma. They
usually present as solitary tumors. In some instance, the entity may appear in
multibranched fashion. The main histopathologic features consist of acanthosis,
thick collagen bundles mainly oriented in a vertical axis forming a central core,
and numerous proliferating fibroblasts. In this article, we present two cases of 
acquired multibranched periungual fibrokeratoma and depict their varying clinical
features over time. Binucleation and perinuclear halos of keratinocytes mimicking
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection were detected microscopically, but there was
no reactivity with HPV immunostaining. In context, anti-HPV immunostaining may be
helpful in the differentiation of fibrokeratomas from HPV infection. On the other
hand, it should be kept in mind that these histopathologic findings may be found 
in acral biopsies independent of viral effects.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether under ultrasonography (US) guidance or not,
fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has some limitations, particularly in larger
nodules. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of US-guided
fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) in thyroid nodules equal to or larger
than 3 cm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 267 patients operated for nodular goiter in the
period of January 2006 and March 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. The study
group (40 males, 104 females; mean age 42.3 ± 12.3, between 17 and 71) consisted 
of patients with nodules with a diameter of 3 cm or larger. Patients with nodules
less than 3 cm in diameter were considered as the control group (27 males, 96
females; mean age 44.4 ± 11.9, between 18 and 71).
RESULTS: For nodules smaller than 3 cm, US-FNAB had an accuracy rate of 60% and a
false negativity rate of 21.9%. In nodules equal to or larger than 3 cm, the
accuracy rate of US-FNAB was 80%, with a false negativity rate of 6.7%.
Malignancy was observed in 16% of the study group and 42.3% of the control group.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that increased nodule diameter is not associated
with limitations in the diagnostic value of US-FNAB. We also found that the
malignancy rate was smaller for larger nodules. This finding reflects the
importance of accurate and rational diagnostic work-up and clinical management
for detecting malignancy and surgical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: The most important prognostic factor for early gastric cancer (EGC)
is the lymph node status. It is important to predict early lesions without lymph 
node metastasis (LNM) before proceeding to radical surgery in locally excised
lesions. Tumor budding is a feature known to be related to aggressive tumor
behavior in several solid tumors. We aimed to assess the predictive value of
tumor budding for LNM in pT1a and pT1b gastric cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated radical gastrectomy specimens for of 126
EGC patients and assess the possible relation between the clinicopathologic
features, including age, gender, tumor location, tumor size, macroscopic tumor
type, histologic differentiation, depth and width of submucosal invasion,
lymphovascular invasion, and tumor budding with lymph node involvement.
RESULTS: Among the 126 EGCs, 38 were stages as pT1a and 88 as pT1b. LNM rate in
pT1a tumors was 13% whereas it was 33% in pT1b tumors. Tumor budding was the only
factor significantly and independently related to LNM in pT1a patients. Female
gender and tumor budding were found to be independent risk factors in pT1b group.
Other clinicopathologic features were not related to LNM.
CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we suggest that budding is a promising
parameter to assess for prediction of LNM in EGC removed by endoscopic surgery,
and to decide on the appropriate surgical approach.

Glomus tumors in the gastrointestinal tract are unusual, as the previous series
in the literature have been mainly limited to the stomach. Less than 10 cases of 
esophageal glomus tumors have been described in the literature. Oncocytic glomus 
tumors are a recently identified, rare variant of the glomus tumor. We report a
47-year-old female who presented with an approximately 3-month history of
dysphagia and weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a
black-purple, hypervascular, protruding lesion measuring approximately 65 mm at
the 37th cm of the esophagus. The patient underwent an Ivor Lewis operation via
open thoracotomy. The resected specimen had a protuberant, ulcerated mass
measuring 80 × 35 mm in the posterior wall of the esophagus. Based on the
histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscope findings, the
final diagnosis was a malignant glomus tumor with oncocytic features. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of a malignant glomus tumor with oncocytic
features in an esophageal location.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the prognostic significance of Gelsolin, NF-κB, and p53 in
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CRCC), which has an unpredictable behavior and
tendency for recurrence and metastasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 100 consecutive
cases of CRCC using antibodies against Gelsolin, NF-κB, and p53. Tumors were
grouped by nuclear grade (NG) as low NG (NG1, 2) or high NG (NG3, 4), and by
pathological stage as localized (pT1, 2) or locally invasive (pT3, 4). Clinical
stage was grouped as early stage (stage I, II) or late stage (stage III, IV).
Evaluation was based on cytoplasmic (NF-κB(Cyt)) and nuclear (NF-κB(Nuc))
expression for NF-κB, nuclear expression for p53, membranous and cytoplasmic
expression for Gelsolin.
RESULTS: Gelsolin expression correlated with high NG (p = 0.001), metastasis (p =
0.003), late stage (p = 0.008), and cancer death (p = 0.001). NF-κB(Cyt)
expression correlated with high NG (p = 0.002), perirenal invasion (p = 0.010),
local invasion (p = 0.020), and late stage (p= 0.003). NF-κB(Nuc) expression
failed to predict the prognosis of CRCC. p53 expression correlated with high NG
(p = 0.045), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.05), metastasis (p = 0.001), late
stage (p = 0.028), and cancer death (p = 0.034). However, only Gelsolin was found
to correlate with disease-specific survival, (p = 0.006), and neither NF-κB nor
p53 showed such relation.
CONCLUSION: Expressions of Gelsolin, NF-κB(Cyt), and p53 associated with
aggressive behavior of CRCC, while Gelsolin expression specifically indicated
poor disease-specific survival. The results of the present study served to
determine biomarkers for predicting high-risk patients with CRCC, expected to
show aggressive phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Glypican-3 (GPC3) is an oncofetal protein which is encoded by GPC3
gene and takes role in the regulation of cell division and apoptosis.
Overexpression of GPC3 has been reported in some types of cancer such as
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs
and testicular germ cell tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the
immunohistochemical expression of GPC3 in the non-neoplastic urothelium and in
urothelial carcinoma (UC). We also aimed to explore the alterations in the GPC3
expression according to the grade and the invasiveness of UC.
METHODS: GPC3 expression was studied in 108 UC cases by using
immunohistochemistry. Each section was evaluated in terms of the extensiveness
and intensity of GPC3 staining. Scores of immunostaining were correlated with
tumor grade and stage.
RESULTS: GPC3 expression was observed in 38 cases (35.2%). GPC3 expression was
positive in 43.6% of high and in 13.3% of low grade UC (p: 0.003). In 19 UC cases
biopsy also harbored non-neoplastic urothelium which showed no staining for GPC3.
The difference in staining percentages between low and high grade UCs, suggests
that GPC3 staining could be used as an adjunctive marker in cases where the
distinction between the low and high grade tumors is difficult. In addition, lack
of staining in the non-neoplastic urothelial areas in 19 cases raises the
possibility of the use of GPC3 staining for the distinction between neoplastic
and non-neoplastic urothelium, especially in punch biopsy samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results potential role of GPC3 in urothelial
carcinogenesis warrants further investigation, especially the potential use of
GPC3 for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

There are several methods used for non-surgical sterilization in birth control
including quinacrine, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), erythromycin, tetracycline,
silver nitrate and talcum powder. Among these, talcum powder, TCA and silver
nitrate are the most commonly used. However, the toxic and carcinogenic
activities of these chemicals in ovarian tissue have been poorly elucidated. This
study demonstrates the expression levels of antioxidant, apoptotic and
anti-apoptotic genes after administration of talc powder, TCA and silver nitrate 
for non-surgical sterilization in female rat models. The expression changes of
some microRNAs (miR-15b, miR-21, miR-34a and miR-98) that play key roles in the
apoptosis pathway were also included. All expression analyses were evaluated with
real-time PCR. The expression levels of all genes appeared to be upregulated in
the talcum powder group, but the results were not statistically significant.
Increased expression of Gsr and Sod1 genes was statistically significant in the
talcum powder group. In TCA and silver nitrate group, expression of all genes was
appeared to be elevated but only the Gsr expression was statistically significant
in the TCA-administrated group; there were no statistically significant changes
in the silver nitrate group. miRNA expression levels were increased in talcum
powder and TCA-administrated groups, but these results were not significant.
Expression levels of miR-15b, miR-21 and miR-98 in the silver nitrate group were 
significantly increased. Consequently, these chemicals appear to be
non-carcinogenic agents for rat ovarian tissue which do not induce apoptosis.
However, talcum powder and TCA can be considered as agents that are toxic to
ovarian tissue.

In this study, apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms and if present, which
pathway to trigger the apoptosis in the brains of Border Disease Virus (BDV)
infected lambs (n=10) and goat kids (n=5) were investigated. Briefly, apoptotic
(caspase 3, caspase 9) and anti-apoptotic markers (Bcl-2), cytokine response
(TNF-α, INF-γ), reactive gliosis and myelin loss were examined. eNOS, iNOS,
caspase 9, caspase 3 and GFAP expressions were higher in BDV infected tissues
compared to control animals (6 kids and 6 lambs) (p<0.05). Double
immunoperoxidase test revealed that TUNEL positive apoptotic cells showed
significant association with increased eNOS-iNOS and iNOS-BDV expressions.
However, no significant differences were found for TNFR1, TNF-α and INF-γ
expressions in BD (p>0.05). There was a positive correlation between the
intensity of myelin loss, GFAP activity and severity of infection. Inconclusion, 
as a novel finding, it is established that eNOS and iNOS overexpressions are
co-associated with apoptosis in BDV infected neurons and neuroglia. The results
also strongly suggested that BDV infected apoptotic cells mainly prefer the
intrinsic pathway that might be most likely related to increased nitric oxide
levels.

INTRODUCTION: Ochronotic arthropathy is a rapidly progressive and disabling
arthropathy predominantly encountered after the fifth decade of life, caused by
homogentisate1,2 dioxygenase enzyme deficiency. As it is rare disease, the
literature on histological findings is fragmented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively re-evaluated histopathological findings
in resection and/or curettage materials (5 hip joint, 4 knee joint, one hip joint
synovium, one intervertebral disk and one paravertebral disk tissue) of seven
ochronosis cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2013 in a single center.
RESULTS: Necrotic brown chondroid detritus was present in all cases either in
synovia or in subchondral area, some of which evoked giant cell reaction.
Notably, brown pigmentation was prominent in upper middle parts of the articular 
cartilage but not that prominent in superficial parts and in osteochondral
junction, almost stopping at the tide mark. Pigmentation was observed both in
extracellular matrix and in cytoplasm either in granular or homogeneous fashion. 
Depositions were less prominent in osteophytic processes, regenerated
cartilaginous areas and loose bodies. Almost all cases showed synovial detritic
and inflammatory reaction, fibrillation, eburnation, and subchondral sclerosis.
Disk degeneration and findings of ligament rupture were also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Histopathological diagnosis of ochronosis is not complicated given
the unique "black coloring" of the affected tissues and it can easily be
differentiated from other causes of detritic synovitis both clinically and
histopathologically. However, there is no definitive cure for today and the
reasons for late onset of arthropathy in disease course, and the mechanisms of
tissue reaction to fragmented detritus remain elusive.

PURPOSE: Hesperidin, a glycoside flavonoid, is thought to act as an anti-cancer
agent, since it has been found to exhibit both pro-apoptotic and
anti-proliferative effects in several cancer cell types. The mechanisms
underlying hesperidin-induced growth arrest and apoptosis are, however, not well 
understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative and apoptotic
effects of hesperidin on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and to
investigate the mechanisms involved.
METHODS: The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of hesperidin on two
NSCLC-derived cell lines, A549 and NCI-H358, were determined using a WST-1
colorimetric assay, a LDH cytotoxicity assay, a Cell Death Detection assay, an
AnnexinV-FITC assay, a caspase-3 assay and a JC-1 assay, respectively, all in a
time- and dose-dependent manner. As a control, non-cancerous MRC-5 lung
fibroblasts were included. Changes in whole genome gene expression profiles were 
assessed using an Illumina Human HT-12v4 beadchip microarray platform, and
subsequent data analyses were performed using an Illumina Genome Studio and
Ingenuity Pathway Analyser (IPA).
RESULTS: We found that after hesperidin treatment, A549 and NCI-H358 cells
exhibited decreasing cell proliferation and increasing caspase-3 and other
apoptosis-related activities, in conjunction with decreasing mitochondrial
membrane potential activities, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Through a GO
analysis, by which changes in gene expression profiles were compared, we found
that the FGF and NF-κB signal transduction pathways were most significantly
affected in the hesperidin treated NCI-H358 and A549 NSCLC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that hesperidin elicits an in vitro growth
inhibitory effect on NSCLC cells by modulating immune response-related pathways
that affect apoptosis. When confirmed in vivo, hesperidin may serve as a novel
anti-proliferative agent for non-small cell lung cancer.

p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis. p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis
(PUMA) is a critical mediator of p53-dependent and independent apoptosis. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of p53 and PUMA to the
prognosis of MDS. Bone marrow biopsies of MDS patients at the time of diagnosis
(n = 76) and at the time of transformation (n = 19) were included in the study
group. The expression of p53 and PUMA was evaluated using immunohistochemistry.
When compared to the control group, both p53 (p < 0.001) and PUMA (p = 0.012)
expression levels were significantly higher in MDS group. In MDS group, there was
a moderate positive correlation between p53 and PUMA expressions. PUMA expression
was not correlated with event free and overall survival. However, overall
survival was significantly lower in cases with p53 expression in more than 50% of
the cells. There was an increase in PUMA expression in cases that showed
transformation as compared to the initial diagnostic bone marrows but was not
statistically significant. The correlation that existed between p53 and PUMA was 
lost in transformed cases. Our results showed that PUMA and p53 expressions are
increased in MDS marrows compared to normal marrows. PUMA expression increases
further during transformation while the expression of p53 is not significantly
altered which suggests that PUMA alterations might be a late event during the
evolution of MDS.

The myths we believed in familial Mediterranean fever: what have we learned in
the past years?

Familial Mediterranean fever is the most common monogenic periodic fever syndrome
over the world especially in the eastern Mediterranean. It presents with
recurrent and self-limited inflammatory attacks of fever and polyserositis along 
with high acute-phase reactants. The disease is associated with mutations in the 
MEFV gene that encodes pyrin, a component of inflammasome, which leads to
exaggerated inflammatory response through uncontrolled production of interleukin 
1. With the identification of the gene associated with the disease, we believed
that everything was solved and that this was an ordinary monogenic disease with
autosomal recessive inheritance. However, through the breathtaking progress in
the basic research field as well as the clinical care of these patients, we have 
understood that the picture for this monogenic disorder was more complicated than
we had anticipated. In this review, we have discussed the myths we believed in
familial Mediterranean fever and how they have evolved during the past years.

This study was designed to evaluate the ultrasonographic and histopathologic
features of nodules composed predominantly of Hurthle cells detected during
cytological examination. Fifty-seven patients with thyroid nodules composed
predominantly of Hurthle cells on fine needle aspiration cytology were
retrospectively analyzed. Patients were evaluated by thyroid ultrasonography
(US), and biopsy samples taken by US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology were 
assessed histopathologically. There were 57 patients and 57 nodules with Hurthle 
cells in cytological examination; 49 (86%) were classified as Bethesda 1, and 8
(14%) were classified as Bethesda 3. Histopathologically, 45 (78.9%) nodules were
benign and 12 (21.1%) were malignant. Nuclear groove, transgressing blood vessel,
and absence of colloid were observed with a higher frequency in malignant nodules
compared to benign nodules (P < .05). There were no specific morphological
features (nodule echogenity, presence of microcalsification, presence of cystic
areas, absence of halo, margin irregularity, and increased blood flow) predicting
malignancy in the US evaluation of nodules including Hurthle cells. Nuclear
groove, transgressing blood vessel, and absence of colloid on cytomorphological
evaluation are indicative of malignancy in nodules containing Hurthle cells.

A total of 81 patients with an ampullary ectopic pregnancy undergoing
salpingectomy were enrolled in the study. The ampullary pregnancies were
classified according to the depth of trophoblastic infiltration into tubal wall
as follows: Stage I, limited to mucosa; Stage II, extension to the tubal
muscularis; Stage III, complete tubal wall infiltration up to the serosa. An
association was observed between serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
levels and the depth of trophoblastic infiltration. Significantly higher severe
ischemic changes and rupture of tubal wall were observed in patients with stage
III infiltration compared with the other groups. A significant association was
found between the absolute depth of trophoblastic invasion and severe ischemic
changes, and also rupture of serosa. In conclusion, serum β-hCG levels are
associated with depth of trophoblastic invasion into the tubal wall, severe
ischemic changes, and rupture of the tubal wall.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEPNETs) were divided into 4 groups
based on tumor diameter and stage in World Health Organization (WHO) 2000/2004
classification as well-differentiated endocrine tumor benign (WDETB),
well-differentiated endocrine tumor with uncertain behavior (WDETUB),
well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma (WDEC), and poorly differentiated
endocrine carcinoma (PDEC). World Health Organization 2000/2004 was not widely
accepted because of stage-related classification and the category of "uncertain
behavior." The European NET Society proposed a grading classification and
site-specific staging system in 2010. Gastroenteropancreatic NETs were divided
into 3 groups as NET grade 1 (G1), NET grade 2 (G2), and neuroendocrine carcinoma
(NEC) grade 3 (G3) based on mitoses and the Ki-67 index. We evaluated 63 GEPNET
cases according to both classifications. We compared two classifications and the 
tumor groups in terms of prognostic parameters (diameter, mitosis, Ki-67 index,
angioinvasion, perineural invasion, necrosis, and metastasis) and pathologic
stage. All 14 cases diagnosed as PDEC were included in the NEC G3 according to
WHO 2010. Seventeen cases were diagnosed as WDETB, 9 as WDETUB, and 23 as WDEC.
There was statistically significant difference between these groups in terms of
all prognostic parameters except for necrosis, mitosis, Ki-67 index, and grade.
All WDETB cases, 89% of WDETUBs, and 87% of WDECs were included in the NET G1.
There were 45 cases evaluated as NET G1 and 4 cases as NET G2 according to WHO
2010. Metastasis and perineural invasion were more common in NET G2, no
significant differences in other parameters. In conclusion, WHO 2010 is easier to
use, whereas WHO 2000/2004 shows higher correlation with prognosis. However, it
includes benign and uncertain behavior categories, although small tumors with low
proliferative activity can also cause metastases. All GEPNETs should be
considered potentially malignant.

BACKGROUND: In 2005 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology)
consensus revised the Gleason grading system.
METHOD: We conducted a web based national survey of the members of Uropathology
Working Group (WG) and general pathologists (NWP) to investigate the current
practice in reporting prostate needle biopsies.
RESULTS: The revised system was well known and applied by the respondents. In
pattern analysis major difference was detected in reporting medium sized, regular
cribriform glands. In both group this pattern was reported as Gleason Pattern
(GP) 3 by at least 50% of the repliers, the rest reported this pattern as GP 4.
Gleason Score (GS) 2-4 was not reported by the WG. In NWP GS 2-4 was reported by 
25% either frequently of infrequently. Any amount of secondary higher grade was
included in GS by 92.5% of WG and 70% of NWP (p<0.05). Five percent cut off was
requested for the lower secondary grade by 71.4% of WG but 64% of NWP. (p<0.05)
Tertiary pattern was reported by 64.5% of WG and 34% of NWP (p<0.05). Individual 
GS was assigned for each core by 46.4% of WG and 26.5% of NWP (p<0.05). When
measuring the extend of cancer, most included the benign tissue between cancer
foci in the same core. Fat invasion was interpreted as extraprostatic invasion by
85.7% of WG and 55.9%of NWP (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study showed the specific points where the educational efforts
should be focused to have a better and standardized practice pattern of
pathologists when reporting prostate biopsies.

This study describes the clinicopathologic findings in naturally occurring West
Nile virus (WNV) infection in horses. WNV was diagnosed in a foal by
immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods, and the presence of WNV
antibodies was detected in 5 other horses with clinical signs suggestive of WNV
infection. At necropsy of the foal, lymph nodes were edematous and enlarged, and 
the intestines showed diffuse congestion and focal hemorrhages. The most
significant histologic lesions in this case were nonsuppurative
meningoencephalomyelitis, particularly in the brainstem and spinal cord.
Identification of viral RNA by in situ hybridization and viral antigen by
immunohistochemistry was concentrated primarily in nerve fibers, glial cells, and
their processes in brainstem and spinal cord and, to a lesser extent, within the 
cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.

Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is a heterogeneous group of tumors with
various clinical features causing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the ability of F-18 FDG PET/CT for localizing the
primary tumor, disclosing additional metastases, and changing the treatment in
patients with CUP. One hundred and twelve metastatic patients (female = 40, male 
= 72, median age = 60.5 years) in whom conventional diagnostic work-up failed to 
disclose the primary tumor were included in the study. F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging
was performed in a standard protocol (patient supine, arms on patient's side,
vertex to thigh, 369.3 MBq (296-444 MBq) F-18 FDG, a 60-minute uptake period, 6-7
bed position). Histopathology was taken as the only reference standard. F-18 FDG 
PET/CT correctly detected primary tumor in 37 of 112 (33.03%) patients. The most 
common site of primary tumor detected by F-18 FDG PET/CT was lung (n = 18), which
was followed by nasopharynx (n = 7), pancreas (n = 5), tonsil (n = 2), breast (n 
= 2), thyroid (n = 1), uterus (n = 1) and colon/rectum (n = 1). F-18 FDG PET/CT
imaging disclosed additional previously undetected metastases in 32 (28.5%) and
changed the treatment in 33 (29.4%) of 112 patients. There were false positive
F-18 FDG PET/CT results in 21 (18.5%) patients. F-18 FDG PET/CT is able to
disclose the primary tumor, disclose new metatases and change the treatment in
about one third of patients with CUP.

We investigated the effects of the early phase of sepsis and prior treatment of
Simvastatin on muscle structure and mitochondrial enzymes treated with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. We divided rats into control, LPS, simvastatin,
simvastatin + LPS groups. Mitochondrial citrate synthase, complex I, II, I + III,
II + III, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activities were measured. Muscle tissue was 
stained using modified Gomori trichrome (MGT), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and
cytochrome oxidase (COX). In all treated groups, complex I and citrate synthase
activities were higher than in the controls. In the control and LPS groups, COX
activity was increased when compared with simvastatins'. Complex II, II-III
activities were higher in the LPS group than in the control group. Complex I-III 
activities were higher in the Simvastatin and Simvastatin + LPS groups than in
the control and LPS groups (P < 0.05). Myopathic changes with LPS group were
observed in MGT stained sections. Our findings showed improvements in the
alterations of enzyme activities and muscle myofibrils after treating rats with
LPS that had received a prior dose of simvastatin.

Bronchogenic cyst mimicking an adrenal mass in the retroperitoneal region: report
of a rare case.

We report the surgical excision of a retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst that
presented as a nonfunctioning left adrenal mass in a 25-year-old woman with
continuous pain in the left flank. Preoperative biochemical testing confirmed
that the mass was nonfunctional. Bronchogenic cysts are mostly benign congenital 
abnormalities that originate from the remnants of the primitive foregut and
typically occur in the lung. Subdiaphragmatic and especially, retroperitoneal
locations are rare. Despite the rarity of this pathologic entity, bronchogenic
cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal
cystic lesions. Diagnosis must be definitively confirmed by histology.

Warthin's tumor: an unknown pathogenesis: a neoplasm or a reactive hyperplasia?

Rabia AB(1), Ebru LS, Tuba K, Didar G, Gulhan O, Cengiz O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Mersin University Medical School, Mersin, Turkey.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To examine the probable role of angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis in the pathogenesis of Warthin's tumor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with Warthin's tumor (n = 40),
branchial cysts (n = 6), thymic cysts (n = 3), or tonsillar lymphoepithelial
cysts (n = 12) were included. Forty Warthin's tumors were used as the lesion
group, and 21 lymphoepithelial cysts were used as a control group. 29 lymph nodes
around the Warthin's tumor, four of which showed salivary duct inclusions, were
also evaluated. Blood vessel density was defined as an indicator of angiogenesis 
by examining CD31 and FVIII Ag expression, and lymphatic vascular density was
defined as an indicator of lymphangiogenesis by evaluating LYVE-1 and podoplanin 
expression by immunohistochemical analysis.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data are expressed with descriptive statistics.
Comparative analysis was performed using Shapiro-Wilks, Mann-Whitney U, and
Kruskal-Wallis tests. A P < 0.005 was considered to indicate statistical
significance. Statistical analysis was performed using the MedCalc ® v.10.3.0
software.
RESULTS: The lesion group had higher mean values of age (58 vs. 11 years, P =
0.001), smoking rate (92.3% vs. 19%, P < 0.001), stromal degeneration (100% vs.
42.9%, P < 0.001), lymph node involvement around the lesion (87.9% vs. 12.1%, P <
0.001), salivary duct inclusion (25% vs. 0%, P = 0.0001), than those of
lymphoepithelial cysts. Blood vessel density (51.92 ± 25.64 vs. 8 ± 5.35,
number/5 high power fields (HPF), P < 0.001) and lymphatic vascular density
(68.95 ± 21.32 vs. 21.10 ± 4.05 number/5 HPF, P < 0.001) were higher in Warthin's
tumors than lymphoepithelial cysts. Warthin's tumors, and lymph nodes with
inclusions had similar levels of blood and lymphatic vascular density, which was 
higher than those of lymph nodes (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Warthin's tumor is a true neoplastic epithelial proliferation
associated with increased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and induces reactive
lymph node hyperplasia.

All organisms are exposed to chemical agents during their lifetime. One of these 
agents is a pesticide that is used as fly killer. In this study we investigated
the effects of permethrin on rat ovaries using light and electron microscopy. We 
used 24 Wistar albino female rats and divided them into 3 groups. Dosages 20 and 
40 mg/kg/day permethrin were administered by gavage for 14 days. Normal saline
was given to control rats. After treatment, ovarian tissues were collected and
prepared for light and electron microscopy evaluation. Negative effects of
permethrin were detected on follicular and corpus luteum cell morphology in a
dose dependent manner when compared with the control group. Picnotic cellular
appearance and condensed chromatin were detected as evidence of apoptotic cell
death. Furthermore, degenerative changes were seen in the ultrastructure of
mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, these findings suggested that
permethrin caused degenerative effects on ovarian morphology in a dose dependent 
manner.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The basic problem in diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis (NC) is
to differentiate biliary atresia (BA) from other non-obstructive disorders.
Because if bile flow cannot be provided by surgery, BA leads to cirrhosis and
death within the first year of life. The aim of the present study is to determine
histopathological features that may help to differentiate BA from neonatal
hepatitis (NH).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out on 105 liver
biopsy specimens of 74 infants with NC who were diagnosed between 2003 and 2012.
RESULTS: The mean age was 76.5 ± 40.64 days. The most valuable biopsy findings
for the discrimination between NH and BA, in decreasing order of importance, were
ductular proliferation (p < 0.001), cholestasis in neoductuli (p < 0.001),
fibrosis (p = 0.002), and extramedullar hematopoiesis (p = 0.02). While Kasai
operations were performed in 19 cases, liver transplantation was performed in 10 
cases. Survival rate among the death cases with BA was longer than the survival
time of the death cases with NH (p = 0.023). Currently more children live with a 
close to normal quality of life with portoenterostomy and/or liver
transplantation. On the contrary, NH can be more fatal with associated disorders 
such as growth retardation, specific infections, respiratory distress, and
metabolic or endocrine diseases.

Thioredoxin (Trx) is a redox active protein that regulates several physiological 
and biochemical functions, such as growth, apoptosis and cellular defense. The
function of Trx itself is regulated by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). This study
was designed to determine the expression of TrxR1 in meningioma tissues of
different World Health Organization grades (grade I-III). Meningioma tissues were
extracted from the histopathological specimens of 29 patients. These samples
included seven histologically normal meningeal tissues that served as a control
group and 12 grade I, 12 grade II and 5 grade III meningioma samples. TrxR1
expression was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunostaining. The proliferative and apoptotic
indices of the specimens were investigated by Ki-67 immunostaining and TUNEL
assay, respectively. TrxR1 expression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, increased
significantly with meningioma grade (p < 0.001). The immunostaining intensity of 
TrxR1 increased significantly with meningioma grade (p < 0.001). Ki-67 index
values increased significantly in accordance with grade progression (p < 0.001). 
The apoptotic index values were not significantly different in any group (p >
0.05). Trx system seems to be involved in the malignant progression of
meningiomas. Further, large studies are required to elucidate the exact role of
this system.

Complement-mediated humoral rejection has become the main focus of research in
organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible
association of the complement C5aR gene 450 C/T polymorphism in antibody-mediated
renal allograft rejection. This polymorphism was investigated in 290 first
deceased donor kidney graft recipients with well functioning grafts and no
rejection treatment during the first transplant year (WFG), 265 recipients with
graft failure within the first transplant year (F), and 187 healthy controls.
Frequency of the 450 CT genotype was lower in the total population of 555 kidney 
recipients (4.7%) than in 187 healthy controls (8.6%), but the difference was not
statistically significant (P = 0.065). A significantly higher frequency of CT
genotype was found in F patients (CT: 6.8%) when compared to WFG patients (CT:
2.8%, P = 0.027). The CT genotype was also significantly lower in WFG patients
than in healthy controls (P = 0.009). Low frequency of the C5aR 450 CT genotype, 
which apparently is a feature of certain kidney diseases, appears to be
associated with good graft outcome in kidney transplantation and might be helpful
for identifying recipients who are at low risk for graft rejection.

The purpose of this work was to investigate for the first time histopathologic
effects of carbaryl in liver and kidney tissues of Bufotes variabilis. After 96h 
following exposure to carbaryl (low dose: 0.05, medium dose: 0.1 and high dose:
0.2mg/g), the toads were euthanized and dissected. In liver tissue, vacuolization
in hepatocytes, necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, an increase in
melanomacrophage number, enlargement of sinusoids, hemorrhage and congestion were
determined in exposed toads. In kidney tissue, mononuclear cell infiltration,
hypertrophied Bowman's capsule cells, deformation, vacuolization, karyolysis and 
necrosis of renal tubule epithelium, brush border destruction, glomerular
shrinkage, hemorrhage and fibrosis were observed in carbaryl-treated groups.
According to this investigation, carbaryl caused histopathologic damages in liver
and kidney tissues of B. variabilis.

We aimed to evaluate para-aortic metastases relative to the level of inferior
mesenteric artery (IMA) and to discuss the clinico-pathological features of these
patients. A total of 204 patients who underwent systematic pelvic and para-aortic
lymphadenectomy up to the level of renal veins for endometrial cancer between
January 2007 and August 2013 were included in this study. Of these 204 patients, 
44 (21.6 %) had lymph node involvement. From a total of 27 patients with
paraaortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis, 11 had only supramesenteric and 4 had
only inframesenteric nodal involvement, while 12 had both supramesenteric and
inframesenteric metastases. Supramesenteric lymph node metastases were detected
in 85.2 % of patients who have para-aortic metastases and in 11.3 % of all
patients. Additionally, 5 patients had only supramesenteric lymphatic metastasis.
The surgico-pathological characteristics of patients with isolated
supramesenteric and inframesenteric metastasis were similar. However, the
patients with lymphatic spread in both regions were found to have pelvic
lymphatic metastasis and cervical invasion more commonly compared to patients
with only supramesenteric or only inframesenteric metastasis. The site of
metastatic lymph nodes wasn't associated with the likelihood and site of
recurrence. Lymphadenectomy should be performed up to the level of renal vein in 
case of the presence of indication for lymphadenectomy in patients with
endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is not possible to predict the patients with
supramesenteric lymph node involvement by tumor grade, histological type and
myometrial invasion.

Pituitary adenomas are the third most common intracranial tumors. Invasive
adenomas account for only 0.1-0.2% of pituitary tumors. SPARC is a matrix
glycoprotein that plays a role in progression and invasiveness of neoplasms. In
this study, we examined the potential role of SPARC in invasive pituitary
adenomas. Forty pituitary adenomas have been examined with histopathological and 
immunohistochemical techniques. The cohort has been classified into two groups as
invasive (n = 25) and non-invasive (n = 15) utilizing the Hardy classification.
Formalin fixed tissues have been stained with hematoxylin eosin. Ki-67, p53, and 
SPARC monoclonal antibodies have been used. We did not detect any significant
difference on Ki-67, SPARC, and p53 expression patterns correlating with the
pathological subtype or invasiveness. Only 24% of invasive adenomas had Ki-67
levels over 1%. A total of 67.7% non-invasive adenomas had Ki-67 levels below 1%.
We did not detect any relation between SPARC levels and invasiveness of pituitary
adenomas. Absence of significant SPARC expression in tumor progression, sellar
dilatation, erosion and destruction suggest that SPARC scores are not related
with invasiveness or progressiveness of pituitary adenomas.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the likely protective effect of
resveratrol (RES) on doxorubicin (DOX) induced testicular damage. Rats were
divided into five groups: control, RES, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DOX and
DOX+RES. At the end of treatment, the rats were sacrificed. Plasma testosterone
levels, oxidative status, epididymal sperm parameters and testicular apoptosis
were evaluated. MDA levels, GP-x and GSH activities were higher in the DOX group 
than in the control group. MDA levels were lower in the DOX+RES group than in the
DOX group. The DOX group exhibited a significant decrease in plasma testosterone 
levels, sperm concentration and motility, and a significant increase in abnormal 
sperm rate and TUNEL (+) cells in the testis. A significant increase was observed
in plasma testosterone levels and sperm concentration and motility, and a
significant decrease in the abnormal sperm rate and TUNEL (+) cells in the
DOX+RES group compared to the DOX group. A marked improvement in severe
degenerative alterations in the germinative epithelium was also observed
following treatment with RES. In conclusion, RES makes a positive contribution to
fertility by exhibiting anti-apoptotic and antiperoxidative effects against
DOX-induced testicular damage.

This study aimed to determine the role of selective neutral sphingomyelinase
(N-SMase) inhibition on arachidonic acid (AA) mediated inflammation following
liver ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Selective N-SMase inhibitor was
administered via intraperitoneal injections. Liver IR injury was created by
clamping blood vessels supplying the median and left lateral hepatic lobes for 60
min, followed by 60 min reperfusion. Levels of AA in liver tissue were determined
by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using ultra fast-liquid chromatography
(UFLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂),
cyclooxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) were measured in liver tissue.
Arachidonic acid levels, activity of PLA₂, COX and PGE₂ levels were significantly
increased in postischemic liver tissue compared to nonischemic controls. N-SMase 
inhibition significantly decreased COX activity and PGE₂ levels in postischemic
liver. Future studies evaluating agents blocking N-SMase activity can facilitate 
the development of treatment strategies to alleviate inflammation in liver I/R
injury.

Collagenous sprue is a clinicopathological entity with an unknown etiology. Its
clinical features include progressive malabsorption, diarrhea, weight loss,
unresponsiveness to treatment, and high mortality rates. The age interval of
collagenous sprue is quite broad and ranges between 2 and 85 years. As far as to 
our knowledge, the presented case is the first reported case in infancy.

The use of urinary nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22) as a diagnostic adjunct to
urine cytology for monitoring of recurrent bladder cancer--institutional
experience and review.

Önal B(1), Han Ü, Yilmaz S, Köybasioglu F, Altuğ U.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology and Cytology, MoH, Ankara Diskapi Teaching and
Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: This prospective study compares urine NMP22 immunoassay and
cytomorphology for detecting recurrent urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder
and correlates between NMP22 levels and grade, multiplicity, and size of the
tumor. We aimed refining the use of NMP22 test in the management of UC at our
institution.
METHODS: Urine specimens, collected prior to a cystoscopic biopsy either from
patients with a history of bladder cancer (n = 50) or from controls (n = 15) were
studied. Cytology and NMP22 results were compared with subsequent biopsies and
performance characteristics were measured.
RESULTS: Overall sensitivity and specificity of cytology was 62.5% and 87.5%,
respectively while NMP22 had a sensitivity of 85.4% and specificity of 76.5%.
NMP22 was superior to cytology for detecting low-grade UC (82.6% vs. 54.5%) and
in terms of NPV (65% vs. 44.4%) while cytology reached 100% detection rate for
high-grade UC. And, the sensitivity of 98% was achieved when NMP22 was combined
with atypical cytology. Optimal performance of NMP22 has been detected around the
reference value of 6.4 U/ml. The mean NMP22 values in control and study groups
were 2.5 U/ml and 36 U/ml, respectively. The mean NMP22 value was 20.9 U/ml in
low-grade UC and 53.2 U/ml in high-grade category.
CONCLUSIONS: The NMP22 values displayed higher sensitivity for low-grade UC while
cytology was highly sensitive and spesific in detection of high-grade UC.
Combining urine NMP22 assay with atypical cytology improved sensitivity for
detection of recurrent UC. The inclusion of the adjunctive NMP22 test in
monitoring protocols for low-grade UC in combination with cytology for high-grade
UC could enable clinicians to decrease the frequency of follow-up cystoscopies.

BACKGROUND: Screening for biochemical markers is important for diagnosing colon
cancer. In this study, the reliability of serum mesothelin levels as a potential 
diagnostic and screening instrument was evaluated concerning colon cancer.
METHODS: Ninety-five patients who had undergone colonoscopic examination and who 
were diagnosed with colon cancer were included in the study. The serum mesothelin
levels were measured with the ELISA kits and were evaluated in terms of
significant difference when compared between colon cancer and control group.
RESULTS: Patients with colon cancer had significantly higher mesothelin serum
levels (P < 0.001) than the control groups. We found significant associations
between serum levels and tumor grade, perineural invasion, and vascular invasion 
(resp., P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Evaluating the serum levels of mesothelin has a potential to detect
and screen the colon cancer in affected patients. Our data suggest that
mesothelin exhibits effects towards colon cancer and serves as a biomarker for
this deadly disease.

INTRODUCTION: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) makes up 5-10% of thyroid
malignancies. Small cell, squamous, giant cell or melanocytic differentiation can
rarely be seen in MTCs. It is important to determine those with the potential to 
act aggressively such as cases with melanocytic differentiation at the time of
diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A total of 46 MTC cases diagnosed at four different centers
between 2002 and 2013 were included in the study. Immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining with Melan-A and HMB-45 was performed in all cases.
RESULTS: Six of the 46 MTC cases were medullary microcarcinomas and three were
multicentric medullary carcinomas. There were 34 females and 12 males with a mean
age at onset of 51.4 years and mean tumor diameter of 23.2mm. Lymph node
metastasis (LNM) was found in 13 of the 38 cases that had data regarding the
lymph nodes. Immunohistochemically, Melan A staining was seen in four cases.
HMB45 staining was seen in four cases. A statistically significant relationship
was found between LNM and diameter, Melan A expression (p=0.02, p=0.03
respectively) but there was no significant relationship with HMB45 expression
(p=0.07). General survival data were present for 35 of the 46 cases. All cases
without lymph node metastasis survived (21/21) while 8 of 11 cases with lymph
node metastasis survived among cases with survival data; one case that was
diffuse-strong positive for both HMB45 and Melan A was lost due to distant organ 
metastasis six months after the diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Should the possibility of melanocytic differentiation be evaluated in
cases where melanocytic differentiation is not reflected in the morphology (lack 
of pigment) in MTCs? We did not come across a study on the subject in the English
literature. The effect of melanocytic differentiation on the prognosis in MTCs
should be investigated in larger series.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the usability of calretinin staining in the
diagnosis and exclusion of HD in 36 rectal biopsies. Through immunohistochemical 
examination, in of a total of 21 pediatric patients in whom ganglion cells were
detected in first rectal biopsies and in re-biopsies, ganglion cells were seen
through nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. In the lamina propria and superficial
submucosa, staining of nerve fibers was detected in a granular pattern in varying
intensities. Out of a total of 5 biopsies (including one re-biopsy) of non-HD
patients, where ganglion cells could not be seen, the nerve fibers were all
stained. On the other hand, in 10 HD patients, diagnosed by a colon pull through 
operation, calretinin staining was not detected in any area of the rectal
biopsies except for the mast cells. We conclude that calretinin immunostaining
for the diagnosis of HD is an easy and reliable method for use in daily practice.

Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2/CRE-BP1; cAMP-responsive element binding
protein 1) is a member of nuclear transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1)
family. AP-1 regulates cellular processes including growth, proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis. However, biological relationship of cellular
process to each member of the AP-1 family is not clear yet. The objective of the 
present study was to compare the ATF-2 immunoreactivity in the post-mitotic and
terminally differentiated odontoblasts and in the pulpal fibroblasts which can be
divided by mitosis when required. Fibroblasts at various stages of
differentiation co-exist in the human dental pulp. ATF-2 was investigated
immunohistochemically in 20 permanent human teeth. According to the findings
obtained, the mean percentage of ATF-2 positive cells was 68.5 ± 19.2% in the
odontoblasts and 22.8 ± 13.7% in the pulpal fibroblasts. The comparison of ATF-2 
positivity revealed a statistically significant difference between odontoblasts
and pulpal fibroblasts. These findings have suggested that ATF-2 is more
associated with cell survival rather than cell proliferation, and revealed much
of effectiveness in maintaining terminal differentiation than the various
differentiation stages of the cells.

Increased HER2 expression has a prognostic, and predictive value in many solid
cancer types, predominantly in breast cancer. However the effects of HER2 on
survival from cancers of pancreas, gall bladder, cholangiocellular, and ampullary
region are not known. In this study, the effects of increased HER2 expression on 
these types of cancer have been analyzed. Immunohistochemical HER2 staining was
performed in 31 (44.9 %) female, and 38 (55.1 %) male patients with a mean age of
65 ± 10 years, and various parameters, mostly survival rates of patients with
pancreas (n = 30; 43.5 %), gall bladder (n = 17; 24.6 %), cholangiocellular
(n = 12; 17.4 %), and ampullary region (n = 10; 14.5 %) carcinomas were
evaluated. Strong (3 +) membranous staining for HER2 was observed in 2 patients
with gall bladder cancers (11.76 % of all gall bladder cancers). In 2.90 % of all
cases strong membranous staining (2+ or 3+) was observed. Weak (1+) membranous
staining was noted in one (3.33 %) pancreatic, and one cholangiocellular (8.33 %)
cancer patient, and in none of the ampullary region patient membranous staining
for HER2 was observed. Since only scarce number of patients demonstrated
membranous staining for HER2, survival analysis was not performed on these
patients. Based on cytoplasmic HER2 staining scores, the patients were divided
into weakly (0-3 pts; n = 17 patients; 24.66 %), moderate (4-5 pts; n = 22; 31.88
%), and strongly (6-7 pts; n = 30; 43.46 %) stained groups. Patients whose
specimens demonstrated borderline statistical significant (p = 0.052) low
staining for HER2 had higher survival rates when compared with other cases.
Increased HER2 expression has no prognostic, and predictive value in cancers of
pancreas, biliary tract, and ampulla vateri. If HER2 will be evaluated in these
types of cancer, membranous, as well as cytoplasmic staining properties should be
taken into account.

Ki67 index is now an essential part of classification of pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors. However, its adaptation into daily practice has been
fraught with challenges related to counting methodology. In this study, three
reviewers used four counting methodologies to calculate Ki67 index in 68
well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: (1) 'eye-ball' estimation, 
which has been advocated as reliable and is widely used; (2) automated counting
by image analyzer; (3) manual eye-counting (eye under a microscope without a
grid); and (4) manual count of camera-captured/printed image. Pearson's
correlation (R) was used to measure pair-wise correlation among three reviewers
using all four methodologies. Average level of agreement was calculated using
mean of R values. The results showed that: (1) 'eye-balling' was least expensive 
and fastest (average time <1 min) but had poor reliability and reproducibility.
(2) Automated count was the most expensive and least practical with major impact 
on turnaround time (limited by machine and personnel accessibility), and, more
importantly, had inaccuracies in overcounting unwanted material. (3) Manual eye
count had no additional cost, averaged 6 min, but proved impractical and poorly
reproducible. (4) Camera-captured/printed image was most reliable, had highest
reproducibility, but took longer than 'eye-balling'. In conclusion, based on its 
comparatively low cost/benefit ratio and reproducibility, camera-captured/printed
image appears to be the most practical for calculating Ki67 index. Although
automated counting is generally advertised as the gold standard for index
calculation, in this study it was not as accurate or cost-effective as
camera-captured/printed image and was highly operator-dependent. 'Eye-balling'
produces highly inaccurate and unreliable results, and is not recommended for
routine use.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the diagnostic value of expression of
IMP3, nucleophosmin, and correlation of these markers with Ki-67 proliferation
index in papillary thyroid carcinoma and benign neoplasms of thyroid gland. The
aim was also to investigate whether there is a difference between papillary and
micropapillary carcinomas with regard to clinicopathologic parameters beside
IMP3, nucleophosmin, and Ki-67 proliferation index. It was concluded that IMP3
and nucleophosmin cannot be a routine diagnostic marker for discrimination of
papillary carcinomas and benign lesions. IMP3 positive staining was quite scarce 
in IMP3 positive papillary carcinomas although specifity of IMP3 is 100%. A
statistically significant correlation was not detected between nucleophosmin,
IMP-3, and Ki-67 proliferation index. A statistically significant correlation was
found between tumor size, lymphovascular embolism, and Ki-67 proliferation index.
There was also significant correlation between tumor size and lymphovascular
embolism.

BACKGROUND: The recognition of folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) may pose
diagnostic challenges, owing to the variety of histopathological findings.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, our aim is to describe the broad spectrum of the
histopathological patterns in a total of 86 biopsies from 38 patients with FMF,
together with the clinical features.
RESULTS: The most frequent histopathologic pattern was the
folliculocentric/folliculotropic pattern, with or without follicular mucinosis.
Keratin-filled cysts and comedones were the second most common pattern in the
biopsies. Other less common findings included widening of the hair follicle
orifis with keratotic plugging, reminiscent of keratosis pilaris, granuloma
formation, eosinophilic or suppurative folliculitis and basaloid
folliculolymphoid hyperplasia. Coexisting syringotropism was present in some
biopsies. The CD4 : CD8 ratio was at least 4 : 1 or more in most biopsies.
Grouped follicular papules and patch/plaque lesions with follicular prominence
were the most frequent clinical findings. Folliculocentric lesions such as milia,
cysts and acneiform lesions, alopecia, loss of hair or eyebrows were also seen.
In 6 out of 38 (15.8%) patients, transformation to large-cell lymphoma was
observed during the follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The awareness and the identification of the various histopathological
presentations of FMF by pathologists, as well as by clinicians, are imperative to
prevent diagnostic errors.

Here, we present the case of a 31-year-old woman patient who underwent distal
pancreatectomy with the history of gastric bypass surgery for obesity. The final 
histopathological diagnosis of the lesion was nesidioblastosis. Nesidioblastosis 
is the most common cause of organic persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in
newborns; however, it is rare in adults. In adults, it is difficult to diagnose
nesidioblastosis with only clinical findings. The definitive diagnosis of the
disease depends on the histopathological examination of pancreatic tissue and the
exclusion of insulinoma.

Accidental deaths by hanging among children in Istanbul, Turkey: retrospective
analysis of medicolegal autopsies in 33 years.

Kumral B(1), Ozdes T, Avsar A, Buyuk Y.

Ministry of Justice, Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.

Hanging is a type of strangulation by means of rope or any other similar
material. This kind of ligature strangulation occurs by weight of the body
dragging due to gravity and applying force to the neck. Hanging almost never
occurs by accident, but occurs mostly as a way to commit suicide.A total number
of 82,871 autopsies were performed in the Council of Forensic Medicine of the
Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice (Istanbul) between 1979 and 2012, and 4500
(5.43%) of these deaths occurred as a result of hanging. Thirteen of these
reported cases have been observed and resulted in death occurring by accident.
Seven of these victims were males, and 6 of them were females. Examination of
their ages revealed that 3 of these victims were aged 1 year, and 3 victims were 
aged 6 years. The oldest victim was aged 13 years, and the youngest one was aged 
1 year. It has been recorded that 8 of the deaths occurred with rope, 2 with
sweater, 2 with scarf, 1 with belt, and 1 with tights. Investigation of the
incidents revealed that 3 of the cases occurred by tangling in a rope swing and 2
with a head scarf. Ligature marks on the neck from aforementioned materials and
ecchymosis on soft tissue were observed on all of the victims, and the thyroid
cartilages and cervical vertebrae were intact. No substance was found in the
toxicological analysis performed on all victims.In conclusion, our study showed
that although accidental death by hanging took place rarely in these ages, all of
the victims were between the ages of 1 and 13 years who recently started walking 
and entering their teenage years. It is important not to leave the children at
home or in the playgrounds alone for a long time (unsupervised at home or in the 
playgrounds). Precautionary measures must be taken against danger, and the design
of materials manufactured for this age group must be reconsidered.

Mixed medullary-papillary carcinoma of the thyroid: report of two cases and
review of the literature.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are two
distinct types of thyroid carcinoma with considerable difference in terms of
cellular origin, histopathological appearance, clinical course and prevalence.
The histogenetic origin and possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the
development of mixed medullary-papillary carcinoma of the thyroid are still
unclear. The most widely accepted hypotheses considering co-occurrence of MTC and
PTC are stem cell theory, collision effect theory and hostage theory. Herein we
describe two rare cases of mixed medullary-papillary thyroid carcinoma with
co-occurrence of MTC and PTC which developed with concomitant MEN 2A and
different sites of lymph node metastasis in the first patient, while with
atypical clinical presentation in the second patient. In conclusion,
co-expression of thyroglobulin, synaptophysin and chromogranin by the papillary
component of mixed tumor seems to support stem cell theory in our first case,
whereas positive staining for calcitonin but not for thyroglobulin in the
medullary component of the tumor along with separation of these two tumors from
each other by a normal thyroid tissue seem to indicates the likelihood of
collision effect theory in our second case.

Immunohistochemical expression of Insulin-like growth factor-1, Transforming
growth factor-beta1, and Vascular endothelial growth factor in parathyroid
adenoma and hyperplasia.

Sayar H(1), Sahin M, Dogan PO, Karabulut S, Seringec N, Oguz A.

Medicine, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF), transforming growth factor-beta1
(TGF-β1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are commonly studied
growth factors, but little data are available on the immunohistochemical
expression of these factors in parathyroid lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue specimens from 36 patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) (26 adenomas and 10 primary hyperplasias) were
examined. Normal parathyroid tissue adjacent to the adenoma or area of
hyperplasia was used as control tissue. Preoperative laboratory testing [serum Ca
and P, creatinine and parathormone levels (PTH)] which led to the diagnosis of
P-HPT had been performed, the size and weight of the parathyroid glands measured,
and postoperative serum PTH levels determined. Paraffin-embedded parathyroid
tissue specimens were stained with antibodies to IGF-1, VEGF, and TGF-β1 using
standard immunohistochemical procedures.
RESULTS: IGF-1 immunoreactivity was seen in 50% of hyperplasia and in 46% of
adenoma samples, but in 87% of normal parathyroid tissue in the vicinity of the
adenomas (P = 0.005). TGF-β1 immunoreactivity was observed in 90% of hyperplasia,
in 92% of adenoma samples, and in 95% of normal tissues around adenomas. VEGF
immunoreactivity was observed in 70% of hyperplastic and 65% of adenomatous
tissues, as well as in 54% of normal tissues in the vicinity of the adenoma. No
significant differences in the expression of IGF-1, TGF-β1, and VEGF were
observed between primary adenomas compared to hyperplasia samples (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroid tissue is clearly a site for production of IGF-1,
TGF-β1, and VEGF. IGF-1 receptor activity was higher in normal parathyroid tissue
compared to hyperplastic and adenomatous tissue.

OBJECTIVE: This is a case of a prenatally diagnosed non-immune hydrops fetalis
(NIHF) associated with translocation t(5;11)(q22;p15). An association between
NIHF and this translocation has not been reported previously.
CASE REPORT: The patient was referred to the perinatology clinic with hydrops
fetalis diagnosis at 23 weeks' gestation. We noted that the fetus had bilateral
pleural effusion, ascites, widespread subcutaneous edema, membranous ventricular 
septal defect, hypoplastic fifth finger middle phalanx, clinodactyly, single
umbilical artery. We performed cordocentesis. Chromosomal analysis on blood
showed a balanced translocation between the long arm of chromosome 5 and the
short arm of chromosome 11 with karyotype of 46,XX,t(5;11)(q22;p15).
CONCLUSION: We present prenatal diagnosis of a de novo translocation (5;11) in a 
hydropic fetus with ultrason abnormalities. In our case, karyotype analysis of
the fetus, mother and father provided evidence of a de novo translocation, that
might explain the NIHF.

INTRODUCTION: Lymph node (LN) assessment after colorectal cancer resection is
fundamentally important for therapeutic and prognostic reasons. LN positivity is 
an indication for adjuvant treatment. This study aimed to investigate whether
immediate postoperative intra-arterial methylene blue (MB) injection (MBI) into
colorectal cancer specimens by a surgeon in the operating room could improve the 
rate of total LN and metastatic LN recovery for pathological examination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three consecutive patients prospectively enrolled 
between January 2011 and December 2013 were assigned to the methylene blue
(MB)-stained group and compared with 107 controls in the unstained group.
RESULTS: The median number and range values of metastatic LNs, the number of LNs 
<0.5 cm, the total number of LNs harvested, and the number of cases with LN
metastasis were significantly different between the MB-stained and MB-unstained
groups (p = 0.016, p = 0.010, p = 0.025, and p = 0.006 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate MBI (fresh, unfixed samples) by a surgeon in the operating
room may result in a significant increase in the number of metastatic LNs
diagnosed and the number of cases with positive LNs. Shifting of the injection
from the pathology laboratory to the operation theater would be a good
alternative whenever the operation theater is not the area located as the
pathology department.

INTRODUCTION: Melatonin is a hormone which is known to be a powerful
cardioprotective agent due to its free radical-scavenging properties. This study 
was carried out to evaluate whether melatonin administration prior to irradiation
would have a protective effect on cardiac histopathological changes in an
experimental rat model.
METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups. Single dose of 18 Gy radiation and
sham radiation exposure were used in related groups. 50mg/kg dose of melatonin
were injected intraperitonally 15 min prior to radiation exposure. Analyses and
assessments were performed 6 months after radiation exposure.
RESULTS: Severe myocardial fibrosis was observed prominently in three regions:
the apex, tips of papillary muscles and adjacent to the atrioventricular valves. 
Inflammation was found to be more in irradiated groups. Increased inflammation
and fibrosis were in concordance. The number of mast cells was found to be
decreased in irradiated groups. Myocyte necrosis and fibrosis were diminished
with melatonin while vasculitis was prevented.
CONCLUSIONS: Elementary pathological lesions of radiation-induced heart disease
(RIHD) are fibrosis, vascular damage, vasculitis and myocyte necrosis.
Development of vasculitis was prevented by the use of melatonin. Fibrosis and
necrosis were prominently decreased. Prevention of RIHD with the use of melatonin
at the long term is encouraging according to the histopathological results.

Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma are histologically similar, benign bone-forming
tumors. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the natural history;
clinical, pathologic, and radiologic findings; and treatment results in 204
patients between 1959 and 2006 in a single institution. According to the World
Health Organization's definition, tumors ≤1 cm in diameter were classified as
osteoid osteoma, and those ≥2 cm, as osteoblastoma. For tumors between 1 cm and 2
cm, other criteria, such as the bone involved, the site, the presence of a nidus,
and presence of peripheral sclerosis, were used for diagnosis. There were 131
patients with osteoid osteoma (93 male, 38 female) and 73 patients with
osteoblastoma (40 male, 33 female). The mean age in the osteoid osteoma and
osteoblastoma groups was 16.4 ± 7 and 19.6 ± 9.9 years, respectively. The osteoid
osteoma cases were mostly localized in the extremities, whereas the osteoblastoma
cases involved the vertebral column and sacrum. The nidus size varied between 0.2
and 1.5 cm in osteoid osteoma cases, and the tumor size range was 1.3-10 cm in
the osteoblastoma cases. The pain was encountered in 89% of osteoid osteoma and
45% of osteoblastoma patients. Histopathology was similar in both cases. The
treatment of choice was conservative surgery for both diagnoses. In conclusion,
osteoblastoma is clinically and radiologically more aggressive than osteoid
osteoma.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate Candida carriage and
species in Maras powder users and non-users.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 100 volunteering men in 12 cafés in the
city of Kahramanmaras, Turkey. A questionnaire composed of questions about
socio-demographic features and Maras powder use was filled in by the
participants. Culture specimens were obtained from bilateral buccal mucosa and
dorsum of the tongue with a sterile cotton-tipped swap. The specimens were
inoculated in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA).
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 48.0 ± 12.5 years (min = 20, max = 
70). Fifty-four percent of the Maras powder users and 22% of the non-users were
Candida carriers. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.001). 
The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans at a rate of 44% in the
Maras powder users and at a rate of 18% in the non-users. Other frequent species 
were Candida glabrata at a rate of 6% in the Maras powder users and 2% in the
control group and Candida tropicalis at a rate of 4% in the Maras powder users
and 2% in the nonusers.
CONCLUSION: We found that a significantly high rate of the Maras powder users was
Candida carriers. It should be kept in mind that opportunistic infections may be 
caused by Candida species in Maras powder users especially with immunosuppressive
conditions since Candida species are likely to lead to such infections in cases
of immunosuppressive diseases.

Uretheral invagination of multilocular cystic nephroma; a case report of a new
pathologic variant.

Ozturk H(1), Karaaslan S(2).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: The multilocular cystic nephroma (MLCN) is a unilateral cystic
neoplasm of the kidney exhibiting benign biological behavior. The etiology and
histopathogenesis of the disease is controversial
(dysplastic/hamartomous/neoplastic). MLCNs show bimodal age distribution, with
peak incidence occurring at 2-4 years of age and between the fourth and sixth
decades. The male to female ratio in patients aged below 4 years is 3:1, which
reverses to 1:8 between the fourth and sixth decades.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 59-year-old female patient presented with left flank pain
and abdominal pain. Ultrasound (US) revealed 220×109×82 mm multiple septated
hyperechoic kidney cysts with a semi-solid appearance. MRI showed a 245×119×98 mm
multilocular cystic renal mass in the left kidney with hypointense appearance in 
T1-weighted images and hyperintense in T2-weighted images, and multicystic
appearance in ureter projection, the largest portion measuring 17 mm in diameter.
Radical nephrectomy was planned with the pre-diagnosis of multilocular cystic
nephroma or multicystic renal cell carcinoma.
RESULTS: The patient underwent transperitoneal radical nephroureterectomy. The
immunohistopathological examination revealed MLCN with ureteral invagination.
CONCLUSION: The etiology, pathogenesis, and genetic basis of multilocular cystic 
nephroma are currently unknown. This tumor is confused with cystic partially
differentiated nephroblastoma and cystic Wilms tumor in childhood, and
multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, clear cell papillary renal cell
carcinoma, and tubulocystic carcinoma in adults. The association of this tumor
with pleuropulmonary blastoma in children exhibits genetic inheritance. US
control is particularly recommended in siblings of these children. Albeit rare,
the disease can occur as a bilateral synchronous or metachronous lesion. There
are four reports of cases with recurrence in the literature. The laparoscopic
partial nephrectomy is the recommended treatment method in patients with
sufficient renal reserve that are found to be free of malignancy in the frozen
section examination. The symptoms of hematuria and flank pain can be associated
with invagination of the cysts into the pelvis and intrarenal rupture of the
cysts. The invagination of cysts into the pelvis has been previously described.
The authors consider that this was the first case of MLCN in the literature
exhibiting invagination into the ureter.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a common, minimally invasive,
cost-effective, and rapid method to manage thyroid nodules, but nondiagnostic
FNAB (ND-FNAB) is still a common problem due to high prevalence (2%-20%). Our
purpose in this study is to investigate risk of malignancy of repeating ND-FNABs 
and correlation between clinical and ultrasound findings. Our cohort study
included 75 patients who had 2 or more times ND-FNABs and, finally, undergone
surgical resection. We evaluated demographic, clinical, ultasonographic, and
pathologic features. Fifty-seven patients were female, and 22 patients were male.
Seventy-five patients' histopathologic results were 76% (n=57) benign and 24%
(n=18) malignant. Of malignant nodules, 94.4% (n=17) were papillary carcinoma,
whereas 5.6% (n=1) were follicular carcinoma. We did not find any predictive
factor for malignancy and any differences associated with clinical and
ultrasonographic features between benign and malignant nodules. Reaspiration
followed by surgery for appropriate patients is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a viral disease, common across the
world, and associated with several extraintestinal manifestations including
vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are sensitive and
specific markers for vasculitides. There is limited data available in the
literature on whether ANCA formation is stimulated by CHB infection. In the
present study we aimed to identify the frequency of ANCA in CHB patients.
METHODS: A total of 174 subjects were included in the study (87 CHB patients, 87 
control subjects). Perinuclear-ANCA (P-ANCA), cytoplasmic-ANCA (C-ANCA),
myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA), and proteinase 3-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) were studied.
IFA was used for P-ANCA and C-ANCA assays, and ELISA was used for MPO-ANCA and
PR3-ANCA assays.
RESULTS: ANCA positivity was high in both groups (31% in the CHB group and 26%
among controls). There were no significant differences between the groups for
P-ANCA and MPO-ANCA (P = 0.6 and P = 0.6, resp.). Frequency of borderline
positive C-ANCA and all positive PR3-ANCA (positive + borderline positive) was
significantly higher in the CHB group (P = 0.009 and P = 0.005, resp.).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the frequency of ANCA was high in both groups.
The CHB group had a relatively higher frequency of ANCA positivity compared to
controls. Borderline positive C-ANCA and positive PR3-ANCA were significantly
higher in the CHB group. These results suggest that ANCA may have a high
prevalence in Turkey. Patients with CHB should be evaluated particularly for
C-ANCA and PR3-ANCA in the presence of vasculitic complaints and lesions.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the expressions of fascin and
EMMPRIN in primary malignant, borderline and benign mucinous ovarian tumors, and 
to investigate the relationship of these markers with tumor progression and their
applicability to differential diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An immunohistochemical study was performed for fascin and 
EMMPRIN using the tissue microarray technique. Eighty-one cases were included in 
the study; there were 37 benign, 25 borderline and 19 malignant primary mucinous 
ovarian tumors. For each case, a total staining score was determined, consisting 
of scores for extent of staining and intensity of staining. The cases were
allocated to negative, weakly positive and strongly positive staining categories,
according to the total staining score.
RESULTS: Both of the markers were significantly negative in benign tumors as
compared with borderline and malignant tumors. There was no significant
difference between borderline and malignant groups for both markers. Sixty-eight 
percent of malignant tumors were stained positive by fascin, while this rate was 
40% for borderline mucinous tumors. All malignant tumors were strongly stained
positive for EMMPRIN, while this rate was 92% for borderline mucinous tumors. The
rest of the cases stained weakly positive. No significant difference in staining 
score was found between fascin and EMMPRIN expression.
CONCLUSIONS: In ovarian primary mucinous tumors, fascin and EMMPRIN may play an
important role in tumor progression from benign tumor to carcinoma. In that
context, EMMPRIN and fascin expression may have potential application in the
differential diagnosis of some diagnostically problematic mucinous ovarian
tumors. However, the differential diagnostic applicability of EMMPRIN appears to 
be more limited than that of fascin due to its wide spectrum of staining in
mucinous ovarian tumors.

Clear cell sarcoma is a rare tumor classically associated with tendons and
aponeuroses of lower extremities of young adults and has a distinctive
histopathologic and molecular profile. It has been rarely described in other
locations other than soft tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. Herein
we report a case of clear cell sarcoma of gastrointestinal tract arising in the
ileum, which is rich in osteoclast-like giant cells with a review of the
literature.

This is an unusual case in comparison to other sonographically described prenatal
cases due to very early diagnosis and surgical intervention following prompt
delivery. A 40-year-old pregnant, ultrasonography showed presence of cystic
structure in the fetal abdomen that was consistent with intestinal dilatation. At
32 weeks' of gestation, repeat ultrasound showed collapse of the bowel dilatation
along with the presence of hyperechogenic fluid in the fetal abdominal cavity.
Cesarean section was performed. The clinical utility of this report is the
recognition that meconium peritonitis (MP) may be diagnosed in the acute phase
with typical ultrasound features, and should be considered in the differential
diagnoses of cases presented with reduced fetal movements. Although it appears
that morbidity and mortality in MP cases depend upon gestational age, this case
report may help to manage similar cases for defining the appropriate delivery
time and treatment modality after prenatal identification of the problem.

The aim of this study was to investigate serum IL17 levels in patients with
Crohn's disease (CD) and to investigate the relationship between serum IL17
levels with disease activity.METHODS: Fifty patients with CD and sex- and
age-matched 40 healthy controls were included in the study. The serum IL17
levels, complete blood count, blood chemistry, erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured, and Crohn's disease
activity was calculated using Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI).
RESULTS: The mean serum IL17 level of CD patients did not differ from those of
healthy controls (P > 0.05). There was no difference between the mean serum IL
levels of active CD patients and of quiescent CD patients (P > 0.05). However,
the mean IL17 level of active patients was lower than of control subjects (P =
0.02). Serum IL17 was not correlated with inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, white
blood count, platelet count, and albumin) and CDAI.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood serum IL17 levels of CD patients were not higher
than of healthy controls, and also, serum IL17 level was not correlated with
clinical disease activity. Peripheral IL17 measurement is not a useful tool for
detecting and monitoring Crohn's disease which is understood to have complex
etiopathogenesis.

The role of IgG4 (+) plasma cells in the association of Hashimoto's thyroiditis
with papillary carcinoma.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is considered to be a risk factor for the formation 
of papillary carcinoma. The association of IgG4-related sclerosing disease with
tumor is reported to be as sporadic cases in many organs. In this study, it was
intended to re-classify the HT diagnosed cases on the basis of the existence of
IgG4 (+) plasma cells; to investigate the clinicopathologic and histopathologic
features of the both groups; and in addition, to evaluate the papillary carcinoma
prevalence in IgG4 (+) and IgG4 (-) HT cases as well as the prognostic parameters
between these groups. Totally 59 cases between the years 2008-2013, 29 of which
contain Hashimoto thyroiditis diagnosis in total thyroidectomy materials, and 30 
of which contain the diagnosis of HT+papillary carcinoma, were included in the
study. The materials were immunohistochemically applied IgG and IgG4; and the
cases were classified in two groups as IgG4-positive HT and IgG4-negative HT
containing cases, on the basis of IgG4/IgG rate. All histopathologic and
clinicopathologic parameters between these two groups, as well as their
association with papillary carcinoma were investigated. Thirty eight (64.4%) of
total 59 cases were NonIgG4 thyroiditis, and 21 (35.5%) were IgG4 thyroiditis.
Tumors were detected in 14 (36.8%) of the NonIgG4 thyroiditis cases, and in 16
(76.1%) of the IgG4 thyroiditis cases. The association of IgG4 thyroiditis with
tumor is statistically significant (p < 0.004). Multifocality was found to be at 
a higher rate in IgG4 thyroiditis cases. Perithyroidal extension was detected in 
six of the cases with tumor, and five of the six cases were IgG4 thyroiditis
cases. The association of IgG4 (+) HT cases with increased papillary carcinoma
prevalence is suggestive of that IgG4 (+) plasma cells can play a role in
carcinogenesis in papillary carcinomas developed in HTs, without a chronic
sclerosing ground. In addition, although the number of cases is limited, the
high-association of IgG4 (+) plasma cells with adverse prognostic parameters such
as multifocality and extrathyroidal extension is attention-grabbing. To render
these possibilities evaluable, studies to be carried out with larger case series 
are needed.

ARID3B expression in primary breast cancers and breast cancer-derived cell lines.

Oguz Erdogan AS(1), Ozdemirler N, Oyken M, Alper M, Erson-Bensan AE.

(1)Department of Biological Sciences, METU, Ankara, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: ARID3B (AT-rich interaction domain 3) is a member of the family of
ARID proteins, which constitutes evolutionarily conserved transcription factors
implicated in normal development, differentiation, cell cycle regulation and
chromatin remodeling. In addition, ARID3B has been linked to cellular
immortalization, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. Given
the emerging role of ARID3B in tumor development, we examined its expression in
primary patient-derived breast cancer samples and breast cancer-derived cell
lines.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect ARID3B expression in 63
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) invasive breast cancer samples. In
addition, a panel of 6 (estrogen receptor-positive and -negative, ERBB2-positive 
and -negative) breast cancer-derived cell lines and immortalized non-tumorigenic 
epithelial breast cells were used for ARID3B expression analysis using RT-PCR.
Specific primers and Western blotting were used to detect ARID3B isoforms.
RESULTS: Using IHC, nuclear, cytoplasmic and low levels of membranous ARID3B
staining were detected in all 63 primary invasive breast tumors. Nuclear ARID3B
staining positively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) status and negatively 
correlated with tumor grade, mitotic index and ERBB2 status of the patients.
Increased nuclear expression of ARID3B was confirmed in breast cancer-derived
cell lines expressing ERα. In addition, two out of three ERBB2-positive breast
cancer cell lines were found to lack full length ARID3B. Three ARID3B isoforms
were found to be present in normal breast epithelial cells as well as in breast
cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: We report a positive correlation between ER positivity and nuclear
ARID3B expression in primary breast cancers, along with a negative correlation
with the ERBB2 status. Very similar correlations were noted in breast
cancer-derived cell lines. Since in the recent past ARID3B expression has
increasingly been related to cancer-associated proteins and microRNAs, knowledge 
on ARID3B expression and function may be instrumental for gaining further insight
into potentially important cancer-related networks.

Elastofibromas are slow-growing and rare soft-tissue tumors. The etiology and
pathogenetic mechanisms are still controversial and there are only a few studies 
in the literature investigating the histochemical, immunohistochemical, and
genetic features to determine the pathogenesis. We investigated the cellular
composition of lesions with a diagnosis of elastofibroma in 17 patients by using 
histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. There were 17 cases with a mean
age of 53.5 years. Mean lesion diameter was 6.6 cm. The immunohistochemical
method showed vimentin and factor XIIIa positivity in all cases. Four cases had
focal myoglobin positivity in the spindle-shaped cells between the collagen
fibers. Spindle cells were positive for CD34 in 8 cases. Smooth muscle actin,
desmin, type 4 collagen and laminin were negative in all cases. The elastic
nature of the abnormal fibers was shown histoch with Verhoeff elastin staining
and aldehyde fuchsin staining in all cases. Our results have shown that the
concurrent positivity of factor XIIIa and CD34 in the cells forming the lesion
might show that the lesionoriginates from primitive dermal mesenchymal cells. In 
addition, the myoglobin positivity found in some cases indicates the possibility 
of a myofibroblastic origin of elastofibromas.

Fifty five-years-old woman was presented to the general surgery upon the
palpation of a mass in her left breast. In the excisional biopsy performed,
partially cystic tumor of 2 × 1 cm with solid areas was macroscopically observed.
After through microscopic examination, the patient was diagnosed as invasive
mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and the tumor was found to be ER- and PR-negative and
C-erbB2 (2+). In the fluorescent in situ hybridization, HER2/neu gene
amplification was observed. Here, we present the clinical, cytological,
morphological and immunohistochemical features of a very rare type of breast
carcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the breast, with the review of the
relevant literature.

BACKGROUND: Bone marrow biopsy is widely used method for diagnosis, follow-up and
staging of hemato-oncologic diseases. This procedure is also used for determining
the bone marrow metastasis in patients with solid tumors. In this study,
clinical, hematological, and pathological features of 58 patients with bone
marrow metastases diagnosed by bone marrow biopsies were examined retrospectively
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 3345 bone marrow biopsies performed in our hospital 
between January 2006 and August 2013, 58 cases with solid tumor metastasized to
bone marrow were included in this study.
RESULTS: Among 58 cases with solid organ carcinoma metastasis in bone marrow,
mean age was 59.9. Thirty-nine cases were found to have a known primary tumor
focus. The most common tumors metastasized to bone marrow were breast carcinomas 
(23 patients, 59%), gastric carcinomas (6 patients, 15.3%), prostate carcinomas
(4 patients, 10,2%), and lung carcinomas (3 patients, 7.7%), respectively.
Nineteen patients were firstly diagnosed from bone marrow biopsies as metastatic 
carcinomas. The median overall survival after bone marrow metastasis was 28 days 
(95% confidence interval: 7.5-48.4). The median overall survival difference was
not statistically significant between patients with primary known and unknown
tumor (P = 0.973). Statistically significant difference was observed between the 
survival of breast cancer and gastric cancer (P = 0.028). The most common
hematologic symptom was the coexistence of anemia and thrombocytopenia (31%),
thrombocytopenia (27.6%) and anemia (20.7%) alone. The median overall survival
difference was statistically significant between patients who have anemia and
thrombocytopenia (P < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Bone marrow biopsy is an easily accessible, easily applied, a useful 
procedure for diagnosing metastatic diseases in patients with hematologic
symptoms such as anemia and thrombocytopenia besides being an uncomfortable
procedure for patients. Furthermore, it is useful in predicting the prognosis and
short survey after diagnosing bone marrow metastasis.

Emerin expression in well differentiated epithelial lesions of thyroid:
implications in papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosis and predicting malignant
behavior.

Recently, it has been reported that identifying nuclear membrane irregularities
with anti-emerin antibody is useful for papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosis.
However, literature regarding the significance of emerin immunohistochemistry in 
thyroid is limited. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the well-established 
nuclear alterations, nuclear protrusions and recently described nuclear shapes
(garlands and star-like shapes) with emerin immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin-
eosin stain in thyroid lesions. We further evaluated the diagnostic accuracy
measures of tissue microarrays evaluated with both stains, to detect whether
emerin immunohistochemistry improves the diagnostic accuracy for papillary
thyroid carcinoma. For papillary thyroid carcinoma, pseudo- inclusions were best 
performers with emerin (diagnostic accuracy: 0.91), whereas with hematoxylin-
eosin diagnostic accuracy of grooves was the highest (0.92). For follicular
variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, with both stains, predominately oval
nuclear shape had the best diagnostic performance (diagnostic accuracy: 0.95).
Nuclear protrusions were poor identifiers for papillary thyroid carcinoma.
However, with emerin immunohistochemistry, they could successfully identify
malignancy in 83% of the cases. Using emerin immunohistochemistry, in addition to
hematoxylin- eosin improved the diagnostic accuracy for papillary thyroid
carcinoma when compared to hematoxylin- eosin evaluation only (sensitivity: 0.70 
vs 0.86, negative predictive value: 0.81 vs. 0.94, diagnostic accuracy: 0.87 vs. 
0.94). Consistent with the previous literature, our findings indicate that emerin
immunohistochemistry may be used as an adjunct diagnostic method to identify
papillary thyroid carcinoma. Additionally, we suggest that nuclear protrusions
detected with emerin imunohistochemistry may be used as indicators of malignant
behavior in small tissue samples of thyroid.

Foamy gland carcinoma is a subtype of acinar adenocarcinoma characterized by
foamy appearance, large cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli and
infiltrative pattern. In this study, we investigated the histological features
and the incidence of foamy gland carcinoma. We compared foamy gland carcinoma
with acinar adenocarcinoma according to age, prostate-specific antigen value,
Gleason score, peripheral nerve invasion and accompanying high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia. Besides, we investigated the diagnostic value of
immunohistochemical markers in foamy gland carcinoma. A total of 863 TRUS-guided 
prostate needle core biopsies performed at our hospital pathology clinic between 
January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011, were examined, 251 of these were
diagnosed acinar type adenocarcinoma. Conventional acinar type adenocarcinoma was
present in 195 (78%) cases, and foamy gland carcinoma, in 56 cases (22%). We
found that 11 (19%) of the 56 foamy gland carcinoma cases were pure and 45 (81%) 
cases were mixed with conventional acinar type adenocarcinoma. Single-core
localization was present in 7 of 14 pure foamy gland carcinomas, and the number
of cases with a Gleason score of 7 and above was 21 (37%). No statistically
significant difference was found between foamy gland carcinoma and conventional
acinar type adenocarcinoma in terms of age, Gleason score, high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostate-specific antigen values. Peripheral nerve
invasion was found to be statistically significantly more common in foamy gland
carcinoma compared to acinar type adenocarcinoma (P<.05). The staining percentage
of immunohistochemical markers in foamy gland carcinoma was 90.1% for p63, 90.6% 
for 34Beta12 and 90.6% for AMACR.

Quercetin, which is the most abundant bioflavonoid compound, is mainly present in
the glycoside form of quercitrin. Although different studies indicated that
quercitrin is a potent antioxidant, the action of this compound is not well
understood. In this study, we investigated whether quercitrin has apoptotic and
antiproliferative effects in DLD-1 colon cancer cell lines. Time and dose
dependent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of quercitrin were subsequently
determined by WST-1 cell proliferation assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
cytotoxicity assay, detection of nucleosome enrichment factor, changes in
caspase-3 activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and also the
localization of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the plasma membrane. There were
significant increases in caspase-3 activity, loss of MMP, and increases in the
apoptotic cell population in response to quercitrin in DLD-1 colon cancer cells
in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These results revealed that quercitrin has 
antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on colon cancer cells. Quercitrin
activity supported with in vivo analyses could be a biomarker candicate for early
colorectal carcinoma.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of vitamin C
towards hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcy) induced oxidative DNA damage using the comet 
assay. The increase in plasma homocysteine levels is an important risk factor for
vascular and cardiovascular diseases through free radical production. This study 
was also conducted to investigate the histopathological changes in the thoracic
aorta and the oxidant/antioxidant status in heart, liver and kidney tissues.
Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were divided as control, hHcy and hHcy+vitamin
C group. Chronic hHcy was induced by oral administration of l-methionine
(1g/kg/day) for 28 days. Vitamin C was given 150mg/kg/day within the specified
days. DNA damage was measured by use of the comet assay in lymphocytes. Levels of
malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) as well as catalase (CAT) and
superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in heart, liver and renal
tissues. Results show that l-methionine administration significantly increased % 
Tail DNA and Mean Tail Moment in hHcy group as compared with other groups.
Vitamin C treatment significantly decreased the high MDA levels and increased
activity of antioxidant enzymes in tissues. Aortic diameter and thickness of
aortic elastic laminae were significantly lower in hHcy+vitamin C group. Comet
assay can be used for the assessment of primary DNA damage caused by hHcy.
Histopathological findings showed that vitamin C may have a preventive effect in 
alleviating the negative effects of hHcy. Vitamin C might be useful in the
prevention of endothelial dysfunction caused by hHcy.

With the revision of the Gleason system at the 2005 International Society of
Urological Pathology Consensus Conference, there was consensus that most
cribriform glands should be classified as pattern 4. There is now increased
understanding that invasive cribriform carcinoma is a relatively aggressive
disease. This study was based on 233 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens
collected at the Department of Pathology, Umraniye Education and Research
Hospital, from 2006 to 2013. We assessed the cribriform foci associated with the 
more definitive patterns 3, 4, and 5 elsewhere on the RP specimens and evaluated 
the association of the presence of cribriform pattern (CP) with biochemical
prostate-specific antigen recurrence (BPR). In Cox regression model, taking into 
account the Gleason score (GS), pathologic stage, surgical margin (SM) status,
presence of a CP, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a positive
SM, and the presence of a CP were independent predictors of BPR after RP. We
observed BPR more frequently in GS 3+3 cases with a CP than in those without a CP
(p=0.008). There was no significant difference in BPR status for cases with GS
3+4, 4+3, 4+5, and 5+4 when the patients were stratified by the presence of a CP.
On the basis of these data, we suggest that the classification of CP into Gleason
pattern 4 has value in predicting BPR status after RP. However, as many of these 
modifications are empirical and supported by only a few studies, long-term
follow-up studies with clinical endpoints are necessary to validate these
recommendations.

INTRODUCTION: Mesangial IgA deposition is the initiative factor in the
pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Glomerular IgA depositon leads to
activation local complement system. C4d positivity shows that complement
activation occurs via alternative pathway. C4d positivity at the time of renal
biopsy can be associated with poor prognosis in IgA nephropathy. We aimed to
evaluate C4d deposition and renal outcome in patients with IgA nephritis.
METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2009, 40 patients with IgA nephritis
were enrolled. Renal biopsy specimens of 33 patients have been evaluated. C4d
immunohistochemical staining was performed 3-μm deparaffinized and rehydrated
sections of formaldehyde-fixed renal tissues, using rabbit polyclonal anti-human 
C4d as the antibody. Baseline demographical, clinical and laboratory data were
recorded retrospectively.
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 35.9 ± 12.9 years and female/male ratio was
19/21. Mean duration of follow-up was 32.8 (12-60) months. Baseline glomerular
filtration ratio (GFR) and proteinuria were 55.8 ml/min and 2.44 gr/day
respectively at the time of renal biopsy. Eleven patients were C4d positive.
Presence of hypertension (p=0.133), proteinuria (p=0.007), serum creatinine
levels (p=0.056) and glomerulosclerosis (p=0.004), mesengial hypersellularity
(p=0.0001) and interstitial fibrosis (p=0.006) at the time of renal biopsy were
higher in C4d positive group rather than negative group. Evolution to renal
failure were 63.6% in C4d positive group and 13.6% in negative group (p=0.006).
Renal survival at 3 years was 39% in C4d-positive patients versus 66.7% in the
C4d-negative patients (log rank- p=0.0072).

Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primary gnathic sarcoma. Neither the etiology
nor the variables effecting the prognosis are fully known due mostly to the
rarity of gnathic osteosarcomas. To date a considerable number of
clinicopathologic features have been suggested in the evaluation of gnathic
osteosarcomas. Still there is a need to experience on several aspects of
management. The aim of this study is to report a series of 33 cases of
osteosarcoma involving either mandible or maxilla. The clinical, radiological and
histopathological features of our cases have usually been non-specific and the
most frequent provisional diagnosis were "benign fibroosseous lesion, abnormal
mass, giant cell granuloma and benign bone tumor". This non-specific presentation
of osteosarcomas of the jaws is compatible with those reported previously. A
combined clinical, radiological and pathological study is essential in arriving
at the correct diagnosis.

Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma is an uncommon tumor of the testes
that usually presents as a hydrocele. Here, we present the case of one patient
who did not have a history of asbestos exposure. The tumor was localized in the
tunica vaginalis and was composed of three pedunculated masses macroscopically.
Microscopically, branching papillary structures with focal coagulative necrosis
were present. In addition to immunohistochemistry, simian virus 40 DNA was also
tested by polymerase chain reaction. This report presents one case of this rare
entity, its clinical and macroscopic features, and follow-up results.

Leptin is a neuroendocrine peptide released by adipose tissue that enhances
metabolism and acts on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite. Leptin also
regulates aspects of cardiovascular function and low serum leptin has been
associated with increased mortality in humans. We hypothesized that leptin
deficiency alters the structure and function of the pulmonary
vasculature.METHODS: We examined two groups of C57BL/6 male mice aged 12 weeks:
five ob/ob (B6.VLepob/ob) leptin-deficient and five wild type (WT) (C57BL/6)
control mice. As expected, weight was significantly greater in ob/ob mice
relative to WT mice [weight (g), Mean±SD): ob/ob 52±2.5 g, wild type 30±2.5 g;
p<0.001]. The pulmonary vasculature of ob/ob mice and WT control animals was
examined by histology, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: Pulmonary arterial wall thickness was significantly increased in ob/ob
mice relative to WT littermates [median (interquartile range) distance in pixels:
ob/ob 0.13 (0.05-0.18), wild type 0.03 (0.02-0.04); p=0.001]. The ob/ob mice also
exhibited significant right ventricular hypertrophy in comparison to control
animals [RV thickness (Mean±SD): ob/ob 0.75±0.19, wild type; 0.58±0.13 p<0.001]. 
We observed substantial macrophage infiltration and abundant proliferation of
myofibroblasts and fibroblasts in histological sections of pulmonary arterioles
of ob/ob mice. In addition, we noted increased hyaluronan deposition,
colocalizing with SMC-actin in the pulmonary vasculature of ob/ob mice relative
to WT controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary pathology of leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice
recapitulates many of the histological features of pulmonary vascular diseases,
including pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that leptin deficiency is associated
to the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of imprint cytology of core needle biopsy
specimens in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
METHODS: Between December 24, 2011 and May 9, 2013, patients with an abnormal DRE
and/or serum PSA level of >2.5 ng/mL underwent transrectal prostate needle
biopsy. Samples with positive imprint cytology but negative initial histologic
exam underwent repeat sectioning and histological examination.
RESULTS: 1,262 transrectal prostate needle biopsy specimens were evaluated from
100 patients. Malignant imprint cytology was found in 236 specimens (18.7%), 197 
(15.6%) of which were confirmed by histologic examination, giving an initial 3.1%
(n = 39) rate of discrepant results by imprint cytology. Upon repeat sectioning
and histologic examination of these 39 biopsy samples, 14 (1.1% of the original
specimens) were then diagnosed as malignant, 3 (0.2%) as atypical small acinar
proliferation (ASAP), and 5 (0.4%) as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (HGPIN). Overall, 964 (76.4%) specimens were negative for malignancy by
imprint cytology. Seven (0.6%) specimens were benign by cytology but malignant
cells were found on histological evaluation. On imprint cytology examination,
nonmalignant but abnormal findings were seen in 62 specimens (4.9%). These were
all due to benign processes. After reexamination, the accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false-positive
rate, false-negative rate of imprint preparations were 98.1, 96.9, 98.4, 92.8,
99.3, 1.6, 3.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Imprint cytology is valuable tool for evaluating TRUS-guided core
needle biopsy specimens from the prostate. Use of imprint cytology in combination
with histopathology increases diagnostic accuracy when compared with
histopathologic assessment alone.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of long term Sodium nitrite 
(NaNO2) consumption. Swiss albino mice were given NaNO2 (0, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) 
as mixed in feed for 8 months. At the end of treatments, animals were sacrificed 
and selected organs were processed for histopathologic, imunohistochemical,
biochemical and genotoxic investigations. Mild to moderate degenerative changes
were observed in liver, kidney, intestine, lung and spleen of NaNO2-given mice.
Inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrotyrosine activities increased in liver
and kidney of NaNO2-given mice. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen activity
increased in liver. Apoptotic cell death was observed in livers of the treatment 
groups. Liver malondialdehyde level was higher in the treatment groups while no
change was seen in kidney. Nitric oxide levels in both liver and kidney of the
treatment groups were lower than those of the control group. In genotoxic
investigations, the number of chromosome and chromatid breaks, chromatid
association, and polyploidy increased while mitotic index decreased in
NaNO2-given mice. The results showed that NaNO2 would cause histopathologic
changes, nitrosative tissue damage, and lipid peroxidation in liver and kidney,
as well as induce chromosomal aberrations even if it was given at low levels for 
long time.

Here, we report a case of a 16-year-old female patient was referred with scalp
swelling and headache. Her neurological examination was normal and imaging of the
skull revealed a well-defined lytic lesion measuring 15 mm × 6 mm to the right of
the frontal bone. She was operated on with a prediagnosis of Langerhans cell
histiocytosis. A wide excision with negative margins was made and the defect was 
reconstructed with a titanium plate. Subsequently, the lesion was
histopathologically diagnosed as an angiolipoma of the frontal bone. The
postoperative period was uneventful and she remained well during 1-year follow-up
with no evidence of recurrence. Angiolipomas are rare benign lipomatous lesions
located mostly in subcutaneous tissue of the forearm or trunk and frequently
occur before puberty or in young adults. They are not common in bones. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first angiolipoma of the frontal bone
reported.

Comment in
    Forensic Sci Med Pathol. 2015 Mar;11(1):142.

PURPOSE: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most prevalent causes of sudden
adult death. It is difficult to diagnose early MI postmortem because there are no
typical or characteristic changes in morphology. In this study, changes in the
level of the mRNA for the urotensin receptor (UR) were investigated postmortem to
determine the suitability of UR as a biomarker for diagnosis of early MI after
death.
METHODS: An MI rat model was developed by injecting rats with isoproterenol (ISO)
(lethal dose 850 mg/kg) or normal saline (control group). The hearts of rats in
the control and ISO-induced MI groups were harvested at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48,
and 72 h (h) postmortem. The hearts were then immediately submerged in 1 mL of
RNA stabilization solution and stored at 4 °C for <1 week before RNA extraction. 
Relative UR expression analysis was performed using the StepOne Plus Real Time
PCR System with cDNA synthesized from rat heart.
RESULTS: Postmortem UR mRNA expression was higher in the ISO-induced MI group
than in the control group, at both 4 and 20 °C, at all of the time points
examined except 72 h postmortem (p < 0.0001). The largest increases were observed
at ambient temperature and 6 h postmortem.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, increased postmortem UR expression could
serve as a biomarker to aid diagnosis of early MI.

This study aims to determine the effects of grape seed and colchicine on carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4) induced hepatic damage and on some serum biochemical
parameters. Sixty male Wistar albino rats (200-250 g) were randomly divided into 
six groups (ten rats/group) and included the control group the group were given
isotonic sodium chloride (1 mL/kg b.w) intraperitonealy (i.p.), group 2 the group
treated i.p. injection of CCl4 (1.0 mL/kg b.w) in corn oil twice in the first
week, Groups 3 and 4 injected with CCl4 as described for group 2 and the rats
were orally given (100 mg/kg b.w) GSE and i.p. injected (10 μg/rat) with
colchicine for four weeks, respectively and groups 5 and 6 were the grape seed
and colchicine control groups in which rats were orally given grape seed (100
mg/kg b.w) and i.p. injected with colchicine (10 μg/rat), respectively. Anorexia,
weight loss, motionlessness and hepatic colour variation at necropsy were
observed in groups 2, 3, and 4. Hyperemia, focal bleeding, fat degeneration,
changes ranging from degenerative to necrotic, increase in connective tissue
elements, pronounced in portal sites in particular, and infiltration of lymphoid 
series cell observed in the livers of the rats in group 2, treated with CCl4.
Histological hepatic changes in the rats in group 3 and 4 were similar to those
in group 2. The levels of serum total protein, albumin and globulin decreased in 
groups 2, 3, and 4, compared with groups 1, 5 and 6; aspartate transaminase (ALT)
activities increased. The lowest alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were in
groups 4 and 5. We concluded that GSE and colchicine have not sufficient
ameliorative effects to CCl4 induced acute hepatic damage.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of several aspects of
climate, such as temperature and altitude, on dental maturation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total sample consisted of 944 panoramic radiographs
(473 Turkish children from Central Anatolia [228 girls and 245 boys] and 471
Turkish children from Eastern Anatolia [222 girls and 249 boys]). The children
aged between 7.0 and 14.9 years. The radiographs were randomly selected from 2
cities in Turkey, Kayseri and Erzurum. Independent t tests and paired t tests
were performed to compare sex, location, and age to determine the relationships
between tooth developments.
RESULTS: The Central Anatolian children were approximately 0.2 to 3.0 years more 
advanced in dental maturity than the Eastern Anatolian subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The development standards proposed by Demirjian are affected by
climatic factors. However, further research and detailed information to gather
data are needed.

and clinicians. Each diagnostic category is associated with a specific risk of
malignancy and a recommendation for its management. The indeterminate diagnostic 
categories of atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of
undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) present a major challenge for both
pathologists and clinicians. We report our institution's 3 years' experience with
the AUS/FLUS category and follow-up of these patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all thyroid fine-needle
aspirations (FNAs) between July 2010 and July 2013. During this period, 9242
nodules from 4916 patients were reported according to the BSRTC guidelines. We
adopted the AUS terminology in our practice to refer to both AUS, and FLUS.
RESULTS: Of the 4916 patients, 347 (7%) were diagnosed as AUS. The malignancy
risk for patients who underwent surgical resection after initial diagnosis of AUS
was 22.8%, whereas that for patients who underwent a second FNA and surgical
resection was 36%. When we included patients with second FNA and without surgery,
the malignancy risk was 15.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: The malignancy risk for AUS reported in the present study is
consistent with those reported previously and is higher than those anticipated
according to the Bethesda System. This supports that a multimodal approach
(clinical, radiologic, and cytopathologic) is necessary for the management of
thyroid nodules diagnosed as AUS. Therefore, we suggest that the recommendation
for repeat FNA following an initial diagnosis of AUS should be based on a
multimodal approach for each particular patient.

AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the changes in the levels of
interleukine-1 beta (IL-1 β ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α ),
malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in
saliva and IL-1 β , TNF- α , and NO in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples of
patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The subject population consisted of 50 volunteers who were
in need of orthodontic treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances. GCF and
saliva samples were obtained from all individuals before treatment, at 1st month 
of treatment and at 6th month of treatment. Periodontal clinical parameters were 
measured. Samples were investigated to detect IL-1 β , TNF- α , and 8-OHdG levels
using ELISA method and NO and MDA levels using spectrophotometric method.
RESULTS: Since IL-1 β level detected in GCF at the 6th month of orthodontic
treatment is statistically significant according to baseline (P < 0.05), all
other biochemical parameters detected both in saliva and in GCF did not show any 
significant change at any measurement periods.
CONCLUSION: Orthodontic tooth movement and orthodontic materials used in
orthodontic treatment do not lead to a change above the physiological limits that
is suggestive of oxidative damage in both GCF and saliva.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of intraoperative frozen section in the
evaluation of patients with adnexal mass and to define the clinicopathological
factors associated with misdiagnosis during frozen section evaluation.
METHODS: The clinicopathological data of patients who underwent exploratory
laparotomy for adnexal mass were reviewed. Results of the intraoperative frozen
section and permanent histology reports were compared. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed to reveal factors associated with
misdiagnosis.
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 748 patients. Of these patients, 509
(68.0%) had benign, 43 (5.7%) had borderline, 196 (26.2%) had malignant
histological diagnosis at permanent section. The overall agreement between
intraoperative frozen section and permanent pathology was 96.8%. Twenty four out 
of 745 cases (3.8%) were misdiagnosed by frozen section. Univariate analysis
showed that borderline histology (p < 0.0001) and tumor size larger than 10 cm (p
= 0.012) were associated with misdiagnosis. According to multivariate analysis,
borderline histology (OR: 22.6, p < 0.0001) was the only independent predictor
for misdiagnosis during frozen examination.
CONCLUSION: The frozen section evaluation of the adnexal mass is highly accurate.
However, tumor size greater than 10 cm and borderline histology are the factors
that adversely influence the accuracy of intraoperative frozen section.
Clinicians must be aware of these pitfalls during intraoperative decision making 
following frozen section report.

We proposed to evaluate the association between serum indirect bilirubin levels
and liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1b. Biopsy
proven CHC genotype 1b patients' demographics, clinical and histopathological
characteristics were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was done to evaluate
the clinical, laboratory and demographic features of the histologically proven
liver fibrosis in CHC patients. A total of 112 biopsy proven CHC genotype 1b
patients were enrolled into the study. Liver fibrosis scores were measured by
using Ishak fibrosis scores and were divided into two groups; fibrosis scores ≤ 2
were categorized as mild fibrosis, 82 patients (73.2%), whereas fibrosis scores
>2 were categorized as advanced fibrosis group, 30 patients (26.8%). Patients
with advanced fibrosis had lower indirect bilirubin levels than the mild fibrosis
group (0.28 ± 0.02 mg/dl vs. 0.44 ± 0.032 mg/dl, p<0.001, respectively). Indirect
bilirubin level was negatively correlated with advanced fibrosis scores (r=-0.416
and p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, low indirect
bilirubin level was an independent predicting factor of advanced liver fibrosis
(OR: 0.001, 95% CI: 0.0-0.005, p<0.001). There is an inverse relationship between
indirect bilirubin levels and advanced liver fibrosis caused by CHC genotype 1b.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of an intraoperative 
frozen section during the endometrial carcinoma staging surgery procedure. The
paraffin section reports of 291 cases with endometrial carcinoma were compared
with intraoperative frozen section reports, which were diagnosed in the Pathology
Department of Cukurova University, Medical Faculty between June 2006 and December
2012. The reports were reviewed for diagnostic accuracy of the frozen section in 
terms of histological subtype, grade, and myometrial invasion. Concordance values
between frozen and paraffin section reports were 86, 84.3, and 91.6% for
histological subtype, grade, and myometrial invasion, respectively. When
collectively evaluated, two (0.7%) of 291 patients were inappropriately operated 
on due to frozen section reports. Intraoperative frozen section is a reliable
guide for surgeons to evaluate the risk group of patients with endometrial cancer
and prevent an unnecessary staging surgery operation.

INTRODUCTION: There is now increased understanding that invasive cribriform
carcinoma is a relatively aggressive disease. In some recent publications, the
recommendation is that all cribriform patterns be classified as Gleason pattern
(GP) 4 rather than GP 3.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the cribriform foci (CF) associated with the
more definitive patterns 3, 4, and 5 elsewhere on the 185 radical prostatectomy
specimens and evaluated the association of the cribriform pattern with
extraprostatic extension, surgical margin.
RESULTS: CF were more frequently observed in cases with definitive patterns 4 and
5 than in cases with pattern 3 (all cases with pattern 5 exhibited CF). Cases
with Gleason score 3+3 and CF were more frequently associated with extraprostatic
extension, and a positive surgical margin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that diagnosing all cribriform patterns as
at least GP 4 would significantly affect further therapeutic options and
prognosis. However, as many of these modifications are empirical and supported by
only a few studies, long-term follow-up studies with clinical endpoints are
necessary to validate these recommendations.

Ochratoxin A (OTA) causes pathological lesions in the organs of animals. Males
are more sensitive to OTA exposure than females but the reasons for this are
unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the role of testosterone in
male rats with OTA-related pathogenesis. To test the effect of testosterone on
OTA toxicity, the testes of a group of rats were surgically removed. Male and
female rats (approximately 300 and 200 g) were fed with OTA-contaminated feed
(initially approximately 300 μg kg(-1) b.w. per day) for 24 weeks. The organs of 
all the animals were collected and their organ lesion pathology, caspase-3
expression, OTA plasma and organ concentrations and total plasma testosterone
concentrations were evaluated. OTA treatment created serious lesions in the
kidney, liver and testes of rats. The major histopathological changes in the
kidney and liver were karyomegaly, hemorrhages and vacuolization. In the testes, 
there was a marked decrease in the amount of spermatozoon. The degrees of organ
lesion were evaluated and the castrated males had the lowest kidney and liver
lesion scores, indicating that testosterone reduction in males dramatically
reduces OTA-related organ damage. The plasma OTA levels for the intact males, the
castrated and the females were 6.34, 8.42 and 12.5 μg ml(-1), respectively. In
conclusion, despite the similar plasma OTA levels of the intact and castrated
males, OTA is less toxic in the castrated males. Therefore, the well-known gender
specific toxicity of OTA seems to be related to the testosterone levels of rats.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation may play a role in psoriasis pathogenesis.
Lipocalin 2, clusterin, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR-1),
interleukin-6, homocysteine, and uric acid are inflammatory and/or biochemical
markers. However, both the roles of these markers and the pathogenesis of
psoriasis are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate serum levels of lipocalin 2, 
clusterin, sTNFR-1, interleukin-6, homocysteine, and uric acid in patients and
controls groups.
METHODS: Fifty-six patients with psoriasis and 33 healthy controls were included 
in the study. Serum concentrations of the markers were evaluated by ELISA. The
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was evaluated in all psoriasis patients.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m)
squared.
RESULTS: The serum value of lipocalin and sTNFR-1 were significantly higher in
psoriasis patients than in controls (resp., P < 0.001, P < 0.05). The others
showed no significant differences between psoriasis and the control groups (all
of them P > 0.05). The mean PASI score in the patient group was 8.3 ± 6.5.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lipocalin 2 and sTNFR-1 might play a
role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and can be used as markers of the disease.

BACKGROUND: All aspects of aetiopathogenesis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis
(RAS) have not been elucidated. RAS and Behçet's disease (BD) have clinical and
immunological characteristics in common. Although T17 cytokines and alpha-enolase
have been shown to play effective roles in BD and many other autoinflammatory
diseases recently, their roles in RAS have not been studied extensively. In the
present study, we investigated levels of several Th1, Th2 and Th17 pathways
related cytokines and alpha-enolase to elucidate pathogenesis of RAS and to
obtain data about possible treatment alternatives for the condition.
METHODS: Serum interleukin-1, interleukin-13, interleukin-17, interleukin-18,
interferon gamma and alpha-enolase levels in 24 patients with RAS, 30 patients
with BD and 20 healthy controls were measured.
RESULTS: Serum interleukin-1, interleukin-13, interleukin-17, interleukin-18,
interferon gamma and alpha-enolase levels were higher in patients with RAS and
patients with BD than in healthy controls (P < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Like Th1 and Th2 cells, Th17 cells were found to be effective in
pathogenesis of RAS. In addition, alpha-enolase, the levels of which were high,
may play an important role in etio-pathogenesis of RAS. Further studies to be
designed in the light of these findings are required to shed light on
pathogenesis and treatment of the condition.

Küçükçekmece, 34303 Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: The role of single preoperative serum CA-125 levels in predicting
pelvic or paraaortic lymph node metastasis in patients operated for epithelial
ovarian cancer has been investigated.
METHODS: 176 patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian carcinoma after staging
laparotomy between January 2002 and May 2010 were evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: The mean, geometric mean, and median of preoperative serum CA-125 levels
were 632,6, 200,29, and 191,5 U/mL, respectively. The cut-off value predicting
lymph node metastases in the ROC curve was 71,92 U/mL, which is significant in
logistic regression analysis (P = 0.005). The preoperative log CA-125 levels were
also statistically significant in predicting lymph node metastasis in logistic
regression analysis (P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: The tumor marker CA-125, which increases with grade independent of
the effect of stage in EOC, is predictive of lymph node metastasis with a high
rate of false positivity in Turkish population. The high false positive rate may 
obscure the predictive value of CA-125.

Injury and death cases caused by booby traps are not common in forensic medicine 
practice. Besides, installation of booby traps including firearms is generally
for suicidal and rarely for homicidal purposes. Although few patents were
described about home security alarm system that were created by firearms in the
United States, 1 sample of injury with a similar unconventional mechanism of home
safety system was reported by Asirdizer and Yavuz in 2009. In the published case 
report, the story of an electrical technician who was invited to a summer house
by the homeowner to check the home security alarm system was reported. In the
so-called report, he was stated to be injured by the shotgun attached to the
unconventional home security alarm system while checking the system. As a result,
the homeowner was convicted of a possible intent to cause a life-threatening
injury to the technician.The so-called homeowner and his wife died by the same
shotgun attached to the same unconventional home security alarm system 4 years on
from the first event. In the present case report, we have aimed to present the
findings of the crime scene and the autopsies of these unusual 2 deaths and to
discuss individual and legal factors in paving the way for the deaths of 2
people.

BACKGROUND: It is well known that diabetes mellitus may cause testicular damage. 
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor beta (NGF-β)
are important neurotrophic factors for male reproductive system.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the correlation between testicular damage and 
testicular VEGF and NGF-β levels in diabetic rats.
METHODS: Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 45 mg/kg/i.p.) in adult
rats. Five weeks later testicular tissue was removed; testicular VEGF and NGF-β
levels were measured by ELISA. Testicular damage was detected by using
hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining, and apoptosis
was identified by terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL). Seminiferous tubular sperm formation was evaluated using
Johnsen's score.
RESULTS: In diabetic rats, seminiferous tubule diameter was found to be
decreased; basement membrane was found to be thickened in seminiferous tubules
and degenerated germ cells. Additionally, TUNEL-positive cells were increased in 
number of VEGF+ cells and levels of VEGF and NGF-β were decreased in diabetic
testes. Correlation between VEGF and NGF-β levels was strong.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the decrease of VEGF and NGF-β levels is
associated with the increase of the apoptosis and testicular damage in diabetic
rats. Testis VEGF and NGF-β levels could be potential novel biomarkers for
diabetes induced testicular damage.

Katip Celebi University, Yesilyurt, Izmir, Turkey.

The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), directed against intracellular
antigens, is a hallmark of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The indirect
immunofluorescence (IIF) assay is among the most commonly used routine methods
for ANA detection as the screening test. The objective of the study was to
evaluate ANA patterns in a 4-year period retrospectively. All 19 996 serum
samples that were sent to the Laboratory of Medical Microbiology of the tertiary 
Hospital by any hospital department between 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2013
with a request to test for ANA, anti-ENA or both were included in the study. Of
these samples, 4375 (21.9%) were ANA-IIF-positive and 15621 (78.1%) were
ANA-IIF-negative. The presented ANA-positive samples consisted of 2392 (54.67%)
homogenous, 818 (18.70%) speckled, 396 (9.05%) centromere, 242 (5.53%) nucleolar,
213 (4.87%) nuclear dots, 178 (4.07%) cytoplasmic (except for actin and golgi),
24 (0.55%) actin, 9 (0.21%) golgi, 53 (1.21%) nuclear membrane and 50 (1.14%)
mixed pattern. Totally 7800 samples were examined by LIA. Of these samples, 3440 
were positive and 4307 were negative with IIF and LIA. In addition, 22 samples
were detected as IIF-positive but LIA-negative, whereas the rest 31 samples were 
IIF-negative but LIA-positive. ANA patterns in 22 IIF-positive samples were
homogenous (9), speckled (5), golgi (4), cytoplasmic (3) and nucleolar (1).
SSA/Ro-52, SSB/La and Scl-70 positivity were detected in 31
IIF-negative/LIA-positive samples by LIA. The present study comes forward with
its overall scope, which covers 4-year data obtained in tertiary hospital located
in the western part of Turkey.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of Dexpanthenol (Dxp) on liver
and pancreas histology and cytokine levels in streptozotocine (STZ)-induced
diabetic rats. Twenty-four Wistar albino male rats were divided into four groups:
control, Dxp, STZ-induced diabetic (STZ) and diabetic treatment with Dexpanthenol
(STZ-Dxp) groups. Experimental diabetes was induced by single dose STZ (50 mg/kg)
intraperitoneally (i.p.). After administration of STZ, the STZ-Dxp group began to
receive a 300 mg/kg/day i.p. dose of Dxp for 6 weeks. Liver and pancreas tissues 
of the control group were in normal morphology. Liver tissue of STZ group showed 
vacuolisation of hepatocytes in the liver parenchyma with enlargement of
sinusoidal spaces and increasing amounts of connective tissue in the portal area.
Pancreatic section of STZ group displayed β-cells with of cytoplasmic mass,
reduction of islet size, and atrophy. The STZ-Dxp group that received Dxp
treatment exhibit partially normal hepatic parenchyma. Histochemical examinations
revealed that the diabetes-induced glycogen depletion markedly improved with the 
Dxp treatment (p⟨0.001). The severity of degenerative alteration was lessened by 
Dxp supplementation in the STZ-Dxp group. Induction of STZ presented a
significant increase both in interleukin-1α (IL-1α) (p=0.033) and monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (p=0.011) levels, when compared with the control
rats. DXP-treated diabetic rats' IL-1α and MCP-1 levels were similar to control
value. This evidence suggests that Dxp is effective in reducing STZ-induced,
diabetic-related complications and may be beneficial for the treatment of
diabetic patients.

A rare tumour, cerebellar liponeurocytoma, is classified into glioneuronal
tumours under the 2000 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumours 
of the central nervous system. The current 2007 WHO classification, therefore,
assigns grade II to the cerebellar liponeurocytoma. Tumours are predominantly
localized in cerebellar hemispheres, and the second most common location is the
vermis. To date, approximately 40 reported cases of cerebellar and 10 cases of
supratentorial intraventricular liponeurocytoma have been reported. In this
report, an unusual case of cerebellar liponeurocytoma was presented with
extracerebellar location. In the future tumour classification, it should be
considered that liponeurocytomas are not restricted only to the cerebellum, but
they are located in supratentorial areas as well.

We performed this study to examine the prevalence of tumor deposits (TD) in
gastric adenocarcinomas (GACa), and the relevance of their presence, size and
type to clinical outcome. Ninety-six patients, histopathologically diagnosed as
GACa following a total/subtotal gastrectomy were included, and clinicopathologic 
data were recorded. Due to the statistical analysis, the majority of TD(+) cases 
were of intestinal type and showed vascular invasion. In these cases, the
incidence of local recurrence was significantly higher. The majority of GACa of
intestinal type with TD were of high grade and showed vascular invasion.
Recurrence and death were more commonly encountered among them. The
recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly shorter in patients with TDs,
which was also confirmed by multivariate analysis, and there was a significant
difference between both RFS and overall survival of TD(+) and TD(-) cases of
intestinal type GACa. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrate that TDs are
not infrequently observed in GACa, they are more commonly associated with the
intestinal type and vascular invasive gastric cancers. Our study shows the
prognostic impact of TDs, especially regarding the RFS. Therefore, the
documentation of TDs might be considered for prospective studies, especially for 
the intestinal type GACa, a shortcoming of this study.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression rates of CD133 and CD90
in cirrhosis-dysplastic nodule-HCC (Crh-DN-HCC) sequence related to the etiologic
background. Thirty-five HCC, 8 small cell dysplasia (SCD), and 63 cases of
cirrhosis having different etiologies were collected. Immunohistochemical
expressions of CD133 and CD90 were evaluated. CD133 positivity was higher in HCC 
cases with chronic hepatitis B and CD90 with chronic hepatitis C. The highest
staining rate was seen in poorly differentiated HCC cases. Only one SCD case and 
almost half of the cirrhotic cases which were stained for CD133 were associated
with hepatitis B; none was stained for CD90. Increased CD133 expression indicated
a significantly shorter overall survival rate. No significant relationship was
detected between the expression rates of CD133 or CD90 and other parameters. In
this study, which investigates the immunohistochemical expression profiles of
CD133 and CD90 through Crh-DN-HCC sequence, the highest staining rate was
detected in HCC. It is rational to try to elucidate the earliest events in
hepatocarcinogenesis by studying SCD. It is important to be aware of this issue
in daily practice, which will provide a deeper insight into the understanding of 
the effects of CSCs in the progression and management of HCC.

Aggressive rhabdoid meningioma with osseous, papillary and chordoma-like
appearance.

Turkey.

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. They are usually
benign and slowly growing; however, they may show histologically malignant
features categorizing them into grade II or III of World Health Organization
(WHO) classification. Rhabdoid meningioma (RM) is an uncommon meningioma variant 
categorized as WHO grade III. The clinical course of RM is determined by local
recurrences, invasion of adjacent brain and/or dura, widespread leptomeningeal
dissemination, remote metastases and fatal clinical outcome. Herein we report a
case with recurrent aggressive left occipital parasagittal region RM in which the
patient initially declined radiation treatment. The tumor was resected four times
in 5 years. Histopathological examination revealed a rhabdoid meningioma with
metaplastic, papillary and chordoid differentiation. Six months after her fourth 
operation the patient died of progressive disease. RM is a rare subtype of
malignant meningioma and the role of different adjuvant therapeutic options are
still unknown. Clinical presentation, radiological features and pathologic
findings of this uncommon tumor are discussed.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expressions of beclin 1 and
bcl-2 in prostate cancer (PC) and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 
(HGPIN), and to investigate their relationship with clinicopathological
parameters. The study included 30 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 40 HGPIN
and 106 primary PC cases. The expressions of beclin 1 and bcl-2 were assessed
semiquantitatively based on both the percentage and intensity of positive
staining cells. Beclin 1 was positive in 27 (90%) BPH, 37 (92.5%) HGPIN, and 90
(84.9%) PC cases (p>0.05). Bcl-2 immunostaining was detected in 99 (93.4%) PC, 37
(92.5%) HGPIN, and 9 (30%) BPH cases (p<0.0001). Regarding expression scores,
beclin 1 was significantly lower in PC cases than in the HGPIN and BPH groups
(p<0.0001), and it was also negatively correlated with Gleason score (p=0.004,
r=-0.274). Bcl-2 expression score was significantly higher in PC than in the
other groups (p<0.0001), and also positively correlated with Gleason score
(p<0.0001, r=0.425). Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between bcl-2 
and beclin 1 expression scores in PC cases (p=0.006, r=-0.265). Our results
suggest an association between bcl-2 and beclin 1 expressions in malignant
transformation of prostate tissue and also in regulating PC cell differentiation,
progression and the aggressiveness of PC.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type among thyroid cancers. 
The diagnosis of PTC may be challenging when follicular variant (FVPTC) of this
disease is present due to the resemblance of nuclear properties of the classical 
type (CVPTC). However, making use of ancillary molecular markers in the diagnosis
of PTC may help. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the SEPT7 protein expression 
in PTC. A total of 55 paraffin block tissue samples comprising encapsulated FVPTC
(FVPTC(e), n=25), and CVPTC (n=15), and benign hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules
(HypN, n=15) were used in this study. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and overall (total)
SEPT7 protein expression levels were determined by using immunohistochemistry.
Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and overall SEPT7 expressions (p=0.02, p=0.001, p=0.002,
respectively) were significantly lower in FVPTC(e) tissues when compared to HypN.
In CVPTC group, nuclear expression was significantly lower (p=0.004) while
overall and cytoplasmic expressions were not changed (p>0.05). In HypN group,
highest nuclear (mean=2.73), cytoplasmic (mean=2.86), and overall (mean=2.86)
expression scores were detected. Significantly lower SEPT7 expression in all
expressional categories in FVPTC(e) group may be a sign of different molecular
signature in this type of tissue.

Comment on
    Fetal Pediatr Pathol. 2014 Apr;33(2):114-8.

We have read with great interest the article by Lausten-Thomsen et al. entitled
"Inflammatory Markers in Umbilical Cord Blood from Small-For-Gestational-Age
Newborns" in which they report Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in umbilical cord blood from
small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and healthy newborns. In this regard, we would
like to make some additions to paper in respect to interpretations of biochemical
markers. Normal CRP concentration in healthy human serum is usually lower than 10
mg/L, slightly increasing with aging. Acute inflammatory response causes release 
of IL-6 and other cytokines that trigger the synthesis of CRP by the liver. In
this article, IL-6 levels reported as elevated but CRP levels have remained in
normal range. In this situation, increasing in IL-6 levels should be approached
suspiciously. Although decreased TNF-α level was compatible with IL-6 levels,
increased IL-6 levels did not cause CRP elevation in this study.

Giant cervıcal polyp with mesonephric duct remnants: unusual cause of vaginal
bleeding in an adolescent girl.

Soyer T(1), Demirdağ G, Güçer S, Orhan D, Karnak I.

Author information: 
(1)Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery , Ankara , Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Cervical polyps (CP) are quite common in adults, they are extremely
rare in children and adolescents. CP containing mesonephric duct remnants (MDR)
are few millimeters in size and seldom grossly visible.
CASE: A 14-year-old female admitted with massive vaginal bleeding with an intact 
wide hymeneal opening. Pelvic MRI revealed 47 mm × 25 mm × 35 mm polypoid mass
originating from the endometrial cavity. During vaginoscopy, a polypoid mass was 
detected at 9 o'clock position of right lip of ectocervix and was totally
excised. Light microscopy showed CP including small round or branched glands
containing inspissated eosinophilic secretions and patchy chronic inflammatory
infiltrate. The patient was diagnosed as gaint CP containing MDR.
CONCLUSION: Giant CP is an uncommon variant of classical polyps and exhibit
distinct clinical and pathologic features. However, MDR are benign lesions of
cervix, detailed histopathological evaluation should be performed to all CP to
differentiate malignant lesions.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate if xanthine oxidase and
myeloperoxidase levels quantitation method may alternate routine culture method, 
which takes more time in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five hundred and forty-nine outpatients who had admitted to
Clinic Microbiology Laboratory were included in the study. The microorganisms
were identified by using VITEK System. The urine specimens that were negative
from the quantitative urine culture were used as controls. The activities of MPO 
and XO in spot urine were measured by spectrophotometric method.
RESULTS: Through the urine cultures, 167 bacteria were isolated from 163 urine
specimens; 386 cultures yielded no bacterial growth. E. coli was the most
frequent pathogen. In infection with E. coli both XO and MPO levels were
increased the most. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and 
negative predictive value for XO were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.
These values for MPO were 87%, 100%, 100%, and 94%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: These data obtained suggest that urine XO and MPO levels may be new
markers in the early detection of UTI.

Cytomorphological features of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor: an account of 12 
years' experience.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara,
Turkey.

Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), an aggressive neoplasm mostly affecting
young children, is characterized by rhabdoid cells together with epithelial,
mesenchymal and primitive differentiation. Diagnosing AT/RT in intraoperative
consultation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples may therefore pose problems.
Fourteen immunohistochemically proven AT/RTs diagnosed between 2000 and 2012 were
collected. Material consisted of squash smears prepared during intraoperative
consultation (thirteen) and CSF smears (three). MGG-stained CSF smears and H&E
stained squash smears were reviewed by a neuropathologist and a cytopathologist. 
The intraoperative diagnoses were based on squash preparations and 3 out of 13
were consistent with AT/RT, 4 were considered medulloblastoma/primitive
neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), 3 were deferred to paraffin section for tumor
typing, and another 3 were misdiagnosed as ependymoma, germinoma and malignant
glioma. Morphological assessment of intraoperative squash preparations showed
that AT/RTs can have a mixture of pseudopapillary and diffuse smearing patterns. 
Cytomorphologic features consisted of characteristic rhabdoid cells (8/9);
primitive appearing cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (7/9);
bi-/multinucleated cells (3/9); rare necrosis/apoptosis and mitoses. Three CSF
smears showed high cellularity and inclusion-bearing large cells. These cells are
characterized by reniform/oval, eccentrically placed nuclei with cytoplasmic
perinuclear light stained areas which are not seen in intraoperative squash
preparations. Differential diagnosis of AT/RT in cytology involves
medulloblastoma/PNET, ependymoma, glioma and germinoma among all others.
Overlapping features of AT/RT with entities in differential diagnosis are
discussed with a special emphasis of rhabdoid cells being the strongest feature
to aid in reaching the diagnosis of AT/RT.

Germ cell transport across the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial
cycle is crucial to spermatogenesis, although molecular mechanism(s) that
regulate these events remain unknown. Studies have shown that spatiotemporal
expression of crucial regulatory proteins during the epithelial cycle represents 
an efficient and physiologically important mechanism to regulate spermatogenesis 
without involving de novo synthesis of proteins and/or expression of genes.
Herein, we critically review the role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in
coordinating the transport of spermatids and preleptotene spermatocytes across
the epithelium and the BTB, respectively, along the apical ectoplasmic
specialization (ES) - blood-testis barrier - basement membrane (BM) functional
axis during spermatogenesis. In the testis, p-FAK-Tyr&#179;&#8312;&#8311; and
p-FAK-Tyr&#8308;&#8304;&#8311; are spatiotemporally expressed during the
epithelial cycle at the actin-rich anchoring junction known as ES, regulating
cell adhesion at the Sertoli-spermatid (apical ES) and Sertoli cell-cell (basal
ES) interface. Phosphorylated forms of FAK exert their effects by regulating the 
homeostasis of F-actin at the ES, mediated via their effects on actin
polymerization so that microfilaments are efficiently re-organized, such as from 
their "bundled" to "de-bundled/branched" configuration and vice versa during the 
epithelial cycle to facilitate the transport of: (i) spermatids across the
epithelium, and (ii) preleptotene spermatocytes across the BTB. In summary,
p-FAK-Tyr&#8308;&#8304;&#8311; and p-FAK-Tyr&#179;&#8312;&#8311; are important
regulators of spermatogenesis which serve as molecular switches that turn "on"
and "off" adhesion function at the apical ES and the basal ES/BTB, mediated via
their spatiotemporal expression during the epithelial cycle. A hypothetical model
depicting the role of these two molecular switches is also proposed.

We present a case of a middle-aged male patient who was admitted to our
institution because of the supposed diagnosis of endocarditis/myocarditis.
Echocardiographic findings revealed cystic mass in the left myocardial wall as
well as floating structures at the lateral papillary muscle, mimicking
endocarditis/myocarditis. Due to progressive urinary retention and clinical signs
of a beginning ileus, an abdominal and thoracic computed tomographic scan was
performed, which demonstrated a large diverticle of the urinary bladder with
expansive tumorous wall mass. One week later, the patient died of acute
cardiorespiratory failure. On autopsy, the tumorous mass in the urinary bladder
with large carcinosis of the peritoneum and multiple left and right ventricular
metastases were confirmed; the histological analysis indicated a less
differentiated urothelial cell carcinoma with its origin in the large diverticle 
of the urinary bladder with subsequent cardiac metastases.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has been widely accepted as the most
accurate, safe, and cost-effective method for evaluation of thyroid nodules. The 
most challenging category in FNAB is atypia of undetermined significance (AUS)
and follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS). The Bethesda system
(BS) recommends repeat FNAB in that category due to its low risk of malignancy.
In our study, we aimed to investigate the malignancy rate of thyroid nodules of
AUS and FLUS and whether there were different malignancy rates among the
different patterns in this category, and to evaluate the presence of biochemical,
clinical, and echographic features possibly predictive of malignancy related to
AUS and FLUS. Data of 268 patients operated for AUS and FLUS cytology were
screened retrospectively. Ultrasonographic features and thyroid function tests,
thyroid antibodies, scintigraphy, and histopathological results were evaluated.
Of the 268 patients' results, 276 nodules are evaluated. Malignancy rates were
24.3 % in the AUS group, 19.8 % in the FLUS group, and 22.8 % in both groups. In 
the evaluation of all nodules, the predictive features of malignancy are
hypoechogenicity and peripheral vascularization of the nodule. We determined that
the malignancy rates in these nodules are higher than that in the literature
rate. This high ratio may be due to the fact that we studied only patients who
underwent surgery. The ultrasonographic features alone may be insufficient to
predict the malignancy; therefore, all the clinical and ultrasonographic features
must be considered in the evaluation of the thyroid nodules. In addition, we
think that the recommended management of repeat FNAB in these groups must be
reconsidered with the clinical and ultrasonographic features.

Newborns with jaundice requiring or not requiring phototherapy (PT) are at
greater risk of developing asthma later in life. In this study, we investigated
the effect of PT treatment on eosinophil and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) 
levels in newborns with severe hyperbilirubinemia. Thirty newborns diagnosed with
severe hyperbilirubinemia and exposed to light-emitting diode (LED) PT were
enrolled into the study. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels, complete blood count
and serum ECP concentrations were measured before and after PT. TSB and
hemoglobin (Hb) counts were lower after PT (p = 0.001). There was no difference
between leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil and platelet count before and after PT.
Eosinophil levels were increased after PT, although not significantly. ECP levels
were higher after PT (p = 0.006). It may be speculated that newborns treated with
LED PT, increased ECP might play a role in developing allergic diseases later in 
life.

Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey.

The number of the suicides is increasing all around the world. In this study, the
cases autopsied between 2000 and 2007 in The Konya Branch of Forensic Medicine
Council were retrospectively investigated. Fifty-seven shotgun suicides were
determined. The cases were evaluated in terms of their demographic characters,
site of entrance wound, the type of the cartridge used, shooting distance, the
place of incident, the place of death, motive for suicide, and the presence of
previous suicide attempts. The most preferred site of entrance wound was the head
with 34 cases (59.7%). Of 34 cases in which the entrance wound was on the head,
there was indirect mandibular fracture in 16 cases (47.1%). In 11 cases (19.3%), 
there observed small ecchymosed abrasions on the finger surfaces, which are
thought to have resulted from the trigger kicking back during triggering or the
finger having been stuck between the trigger and the trigger guard. It is
concluded that there is a need for a legal regulation that makes obtaining of
shotguns more difficult and the people who have them are to be educated not to
keep them in easily accessible places.

Warthin's tumor is the second most common type of salivary gland tumor.
Microscopically, Warthin's tumor displays a proliferative epithelial component
and lymphoid stroma. Carcinomas arising from the epithelial component are well
known, but malignant transformations of the lymphoid stroma are rare. When they
do occur, they are most commonly B-cell type non-Hodgkin lymphomas. A 60-year-old
male patient underwent surgical resection of a parotid mass. After superficial
parotidectomy, microscopic examination indicated that the tumor was of epithelial
components with basaloid and oncocytic columns of cells neighboring lymphoid
components. In addition to the lymphoid follicles with distinct germinal centers,
there were large, bizarre and extremely atypical neoplastic cells seen in the
lymphoid component. Large neoplastic cells were diffusely CD20 and CD30 positive.
The patient was diagnosed with "Warthin's tumor and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
with expression of CD30." The histopathologic and clinical features are discussed
along with a review of the literature.

Nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn is a congenital cutaneous hamartoma comprised of
multiple skin structures. It has the potential to develop into variety of
neoplasms of various epidermal adnexal origins. While multiple tumors may
occasionally arise, it is unusual for more than four tumors to arise
simultaneously within a single sebaceus nevus. Here in, we report a case of a
70-year-old woman with six neoplastic proliferations including a
syringocystadenoma papilliferum, pigmented trichoblastoma, tubular apocrine
adenoma, sebaceoma, tumors of follicular infundibulum and superficial epithelioma
with sebaceus differentiation arising in a long standing nevus sebaceus on the
scalp. Our case is extraordinary because a single nevus sebaceus contained six
neoplastic proliferations with differentiation toward the
folliculosebaceous-apocrine unit.

BACKGROUND: Because there may be interdepartmental differences in macroscopic
sampling of cholecystectomy specimens, we aimed to investigate differences
between the longitudinal sampling technique and our classical sampling technique 
in cholecystectomy specimens in which there was no obvious malignancy.
METHODS: Six hundred eight cholecystectomy specimens that were collected between 
2011 and 2012 were included in this study. The first group included 273 specimens
for which one sample was taken from each of the fundus, body, and neck regions
(our classical technique). The second group included 335 specimens for which
samples taken from the neck region and lengthwise from the fundus toward the neck
were placed together in one cassette (longitudinal sampling). The Pearson
chi-square, Fisher exact, and ANOVA tests were used and differences were
considered significant at p<.05.
RESULTS: In the statistical analysis, although gallbladders in the first group
were bigger, the average length of the samples taken in the second group was
greater. Inflammatory cells, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, low grade
dysplasia, and invasive carcinoma were seen more often in the second group.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the use of a longitudinal sampling technique enabled
us to examine a longer mucosa and to detect more mucosal lesions than did our
classical technique. Thus, longitudinal sampling can be an effective technique in
detecting preinvasive lesions.

Aberrant centrizonal features in chronic hepatic venous outflow obstruction:
centrilobular mimicry of portal-based disease.

Krings G(1), Can B, Ferrell L.

Author information:

Chronic hepatic venous outflow obstruction is characterized by centrizonal
scarring but may also display features that can lead to portal tract mimicry and 
misdiagnosis as biliary disease, especially given elevated cholestatic liver
profiles in these patients. However, these histopathologic features have not been
systematically described. We graded the numbers of centrizonal arterioles,
ductules, keratin 7+ hepatocytes, CD34+ microvessels, and capillarized sinusoids 
in 61 cases of chronic venous outflow obstruction and assessed changes in
metabolic zonation by glutamine synthetase staining. Centrizonal arterioles and
ductules were present in 82.0% and 72.1% of cases, respectively, and correlated
with fibrosis. Centrizonal CD34+ microvessels and sinusoidal capillarization were
closely associated and present in 25 (92.6%) and 26 (96.3%) of 27 cases,
respectively. Centrizonal capillarized sinusoids and microvessels, which were
present in all cases with advanced fibrosis, were demonstrated in 90% and 80% of 
the cases without significant fibrosis, respectively. The results suggest that
capillarization and/or microvessel formation precede and may contribute to
centrizonal scarring, whereas arterialization likely reflects vascular remodeling
associated with progressive fibrosis. Centrizonal ductules were often immature,
being either keratin 7+/keratin 19- (36.4%) or keratin 7-/keratin 19- (10.0%).
Centrizonal keratin 7+ intermediate-phenotype hepatocytes were present in 25
(92.5%) of 27 cases. Lastly, 22 (91.7%) of 24 cases showed loss of metabolic
zonation, with reversed zonation in 2 (8.3%) cases. Together, the findings
indicate that vascular and lobular reorganization in chronic venous outflow
obstruction may result in mimicry of central zones as portal tracts. Recognition 
of these changes is essential to prevent misdiagnosis of this condition as
biliary tract disease.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive inherited
metabolic disease resulting from deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase 
(GALNS). This lysosomal storage disorder leads to a wide range of clinical
variability ranging from severe, through intermediate to mild forms. The
classical phenotype of Morquio A disease is characterized by severe bone
dysplasia without intellectual impairment. Two severe MPS IVA patients from two
unrelated Turkish families have been investigated. The 14 exons and intron-exon
junctions of the GALNS gene were sequenced after amplification from genomic DNA. 
Direct sequencing revealed two homozygous mutations previously described: p.L390X
in exon 11 and p.W141R in exon 4. The p L390X mutation was associated with four
novel polymorphisms in intron 2, intron 5 and intron 6 and one polymorphism
previously described in exon 7. We have analysed the haplotypes associated with
the two identified mutations. These molecular findings will permit accurate
carrier detection, prenatal diagnosis and counseling for Morquio A syndrome in
Turkey.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive effect of IMA in incarcerated hernias.
METHODS: Three groups (n = 7) of rats were operated. Group I aimed to mimic
incarceration, group II aimed the strangulation, and group III was the sham
group. IMA and LDH measurements were made.
RESULTS: IMA levels were significantly higher in strangulation mimicking group
and IMA levels were normal at postoperative 6th hour in incarceration mimicking
group. LDH levels were significantly higher in both incarceration and
strangulation mimicking groups.
CONCLUSION: IMA seems to be an effective marker in incarcerated hernias to
predict necrosis. But we need further studies to generalise this hypothesis.

Chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and γ-catenin are known to play an important role in
development of metastasis in breast cancer. However, there is not enough
information about these biological markers' distribution in different breast
cancer subtypes, or their relationship to lymph node metastases in each subtype. 
In this study, staining characteristics of CXCR4 and γ-catenin were analyzed in
each breast cancer subtype and their relationship to lymph node involvement
explored. There was a statistically significant relationship between CXCR4 and
certain tumor subtypes (p < 0.05). Basal-like and HER2 enriched tumors showed
strong CXCR4 positivity (45.7%). Furthermore, a significant correlation was
discovered between CXCR4 positivity and lymph node involvement (p < 0.05). Among 
tumor subtypes staining positively with CXCR4, 80% of basal-like, 90% of HER2
enriched, and 78.5% of luminal A showed axillary lymph node involvement. In
general, there was a positive relationship between histological grade and CXCR4
expression (p = 0.004). A statistically significant correlation existed between
HER2 positivity and γ-catenin expression (p < 0.05). Basal-like and HER2 enriched
breast cancer subtypes express CXCR4 staining more often than the other subtypes.
Additionally, there is also a positive relationship between lymph node
involvement and CXCR4 staining of these subtypes.

The glutathione S-transferases (GST) are enzymes catalyzing reactions including
carcinogens. GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes are polymorphic in humans. The relations
between polymorphism of some GST genes and cancer have been reported. In this
study, we aimed to investigate the distribution of GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms 
in a group of gastric cancer patients. The study group consisted of 50 patients
(21 females, 29 males) with gastric adenocarcinoma from the archives of the
pathology department of a training hospital. Fifty-seven healthy control subjects
were included in the study as a control group. DNA was extracted from peripheral 
venous blood of control subjects and from the paraffin blocks of cases.
Genotyping of GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes was performed with duplex polymerase chain
reaction. No differences in the frequencies of GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotypes were
observed between patients and healthy subjects (GSTM1: 52% vs. 43.85%, OR = 1.27,
95% CI: 0.55-2.96; GSTT1: 38.46% vs. 28.07%, OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.25-1.96).
Moreover, simultaneous carriage of both genotypes was almost identical in both
groups. GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotypes were not different in diffuse or intestinal
type gastric cancer. Our data suggest that the GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms are 
not associated with gastric cancer in a small group of the Turkish population.

The aim of this study was to develop a computer simulation evaluating microvessel
density according to the Chalkley method on digital images taken from neovascular
hot spots. An image analysis algorithm has been developed using ImageJ, an
extensible, open source image processing and analysis software. The idea was to
create a virtual Chalkley point array graticule, and to calculate Chalkley counts
automatically by stepwise angular rotation of it on the superimposed images
containing properly segmented microvessels. This eliminates the necessity of
having the Chalkley graticule, an accessory that has to be mounted on the
microscope's ocular. The proposed method is a faithful simulation of the original
Chalkley counting procedure. It gives pathologists who do not have the Chalkley
graticule an opportunity to evaluate microvessels quantitatively according to the
basic principles underlying Chalkley counting. Evaluating microvessel densities
in solid tumors is a frequent procedure in angiogenesis research. A few standard 
methods, including Chalkley counting, are used for the estimation of microvessel 
density. Several independent studies have shown that the Chalkley counting is
more consistent and may provide useful data on prognosis. The obvious
disadvantages lie in the facts that this method is time-consuming and requires a 
special hardware. Computer simulation may overcome these obstacles.

Diabetic pregnancy is associated with complications such as early and late
embryonic death, fetal growth disorders, placental abnormalities, and
embryonal-placental metabolic disorders. Excessive apoptosis and/or changes of
proliferation mechanisms are seen as a major event in the pathogenesis of
diabetes-induced embryonic death, placental weight and structural anomalies. Akt 
and ERK1/2 proteins are important for placental and fetal development associated 
with cellular proliferation and differentiation mechanisms. The mechanism
underlying the placental growth regulatory effects of hyperglycemia have not been
elucidated. Moreover, it is still not determined how Akt and ERK1/2 proteins
related proliferation and apoptosis mechanisms are influenced by Streptozotocin
(STZ) induced diabetic rat placental development. The aim of this study was to
investigate the expression levels and spatio-temporal immunolocalizations of Akt,
p-Akt, ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 proteins in normal and STZ-treated diabetic rat
placental development. In order to compose the diabetic group, pregnant females
were injected with a single dose of 40 mg/kg STZ intraperitonally seven days
before their sacrifice at 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th and 20th day of their gestation.
We found that maternal diabetic environment led to a decrease in ERK1/2 and Akt
phosphorylation during rat placental development. It could be said that
MAPK-ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt cell signaling pathways are affected from hyperglycemic 
conditions in rat placentas. In conclusion, hyperglycemia-induced placental and
embryonal developmental abnormalities could be associated with reduction of Akt
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

We aimed to assess the association between serum levels of soluble IL-2 receptor 
(sIL-2r) and endothelin-1 and severe infection in children with Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Fifty-two patients under 18 years of age with a
laboratory- confirmed diagnosis of CCHF and 38 healthy controls were enrolled in 
the study. Patients were classified into two groups based on disease severity
(severe group and non-severe group). The sIL-2r and endothelin-1 levels were
observed to be significantly higher in patients with severe CCHF compared with
those with non-severe CCHF and the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, those
with non-severe CCHF were also found to have a significantly higher sIL-2r level 
relative to the control group (p < 0.001). Although there was a positive
correlation between sIL-2r and endothelin-1 levels, serum levels of both sIL-2r
and endothelin-1 were negatively correlated with the platelets count. In children
with CCHF, serum levels of sIL-2r and endothelin-1 were increased, and this
increase is related to the severity of the disease. In this study, we concluded
through prognosis that serum levels of sIL-2r and endothelin-1 might be related, 
and that hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and endothelial injury might
contribute to a pathogenesis of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a complex heterogeneous disease that is caused by genes,
environmental factors, and the interaction between the two. The leptin (LEP) and 
leptin receptor (LEPR) genes have been evaluated for polymorphisms that could
potentially be related to the pathophysiology of obesity and its complications.
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of LEP G2548A and LEPR 668A/G
polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of obesity.
SUBJECTS: The study included 127 patients with obesity and 105 healthy controls. 
Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length analysis for LEP G2548A
and LEPR 668A/G polymorphisms were applied.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the genotype
frequencies of the LEP gene polymorphism between patients and control groups (P >
0.05). We found a difference in the LEPR genotypes between patients and controls,
but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.05). Additionally, we found an 
increased risk of obesity in the LEP/LEPR GG/GG combined genotype (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the LEP G2548A polymorphism is not a
relevant obesity marker and that the LEPR 668A/G polymorphism may be related to
obesity in a Turkish population. Further researches with larger patient
population are necessary to ascertain the implications of LEP and LEPR
polymorphisms in obesity.

We describe the pathologic and clinical presentation of a very rare, fatal case
of luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis in a 40-year-old woman, who had
a history of total abdominal hysterectomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy in
2003. The patient presented with abdominal pain, and radiologic examinations
revealed a 10-cm heterogenous right pelvic mass with partial necrosis. The
patient eventually underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed an ovarian
tumor with multiple implants in the peritoneal cavity. The ovarian lesion was
made up of spindle cells among clusters of luteinized stromal cells that expanded
to the ovarian cortex. Tumor cells were positive for vimentin, estrogen and
progesterone receptors, and CCD68 (focally) and negative for CD34, α-smooth
muscle actin, β-catenin, and desmin by immunohistochemical studies. Luteinized
cells were positive for α-inhibin and calretinin. Tumor cells exhibited low Ki-67
proliferation indices. The patient died because of the sclerosing peritonitis
component of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of the presence of foamy histiocytes
(FH) in postmenopausal cervicovaginal smears for the detection of endometrial
carcinomas (EC).
STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial sampling was performed over 6 months in 53 of 102 cases
that presented with postmenopausal FH, benign endometrial cells (BEC), FH with
BEC (FH + BEC), and atypical endometrial cells (AEC), resulting in a total of
41,150 cervicovaginal smears. The control group consisted of 58 cases with a
cytologic diagnosis of a normal smear (NS).
RESULTS: There were 0 (0%), 1 (4.54%), 2 (13.33%), 2 (33.33%), and 5 (50.00%)
cases of EC diagnosed on histopathologic evaluation in patients with NS (n = 58),
BEC (n = 22), FH (n = 15), FH + BEC (n = 6), and AEC (n = 10), respectively. The 
sensitivities and specificities of the cytologic diagnoses of FH, FH + BEC, and
AEC for the detection of EC were 81.7 and 100%, 93.6 and 100%, and 92.1 and 100%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The cytologic diagnoses of FH and FH + BEC had reasonably high
sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of EC by cervicovaginal smear. 
Additional studies are needed.

Molecular features of follicular variant papillary carcinoma of thyroid:
comparison of areas with or without classical nuclear features.

We aimed to compare the genetic background of different areas in follicular
variant papillary thyroid carcinomas (FVPTC) with or without classical nuclear
changes. Sixteen cases of FVPTC were included in our study. All tumors were well 
demarcated from surrounding thyroid tissue and had both areas with nuclear
features (WNF) and areas without nuclear features (WONF) of papillary carcinoma. 
DNA is obtained by laser microdissection from WNF and WONF areas of each case.
Point mutations for NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and BRAF were investigated by
direct sequencing. In 11 cases, reverse transcription PCR was performed for the
presence of PAX8-PPARɣ and RET/PTC1-3 gene rearrangements. Point mutation for
NRAS codon 61 was also studied in 15 colloidal nodules. Seven cases (44 %) showed
at least one mutation; two cases (13 %) revealed the same mutation in both WNF
and WONF areas, while in the rest only WNF areas were mutated. None of the
studied 11 cases demonstrated RET/PTC1-3 gene rearrangement and in only one case 
PAX8-PPARɣ gene rearrangement was found. Six cases (38 %) showed NRAS codon 61
mutation, involving only WNF areas in five cases and both WNF and WONF areas in
one case. Neither HRAS codon 61 nor BRAF mutations were present. Fifteen
colloidal nodules were also wild type for NRAS codon 61. Our findings suggest
that NRAS codon 61 point mutations and PAX8-PPARɣ gene rearrangement play a role 
in the FVPTC pathogenesis and may be established before the
morphological/phenotypical features fully develop.

Turkey.

Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor is an extremely rare soft tissue tumor with a
low malignancy potential. The patient is usually a child or a young adolescent
and the tumor is usually localized in the upper extremities. We report on a case 
of a 21-year old male with a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor in the left fibula 
admitted to our hospital due to a swelling and pain in the left lower extremity. 
Radiologically a lytic lesion in the distal end of left fibula consistent with a 
non-aggressive lesion with low biological activity was found. Treated with
curettage, the specimen revealed plexiform proliferation of mononuclear
histiocyte-like cells, multinucleated osteoclast-like cells, and spindle
fibroblast-like cells in variable proportions histopathologically.
Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD68 in scattered fashion in
histiocytes and giant cells, and spindle like cells showed positivity for smooth 
muscle actin. Under electron microscopy, rough endoplasmic reticulum and collagen
bundles in the spindle cells suggested fibroblastic differentiation. Also
multiple large electron-dense lysosomal granules in histiocytoid cells were
found. Multinucleated giant cells exhibited osteoclast-like appearance. All these
findings suggested plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor. Interestingly, the tumor was
localized in bone. During the follow up for 27 months after the resection, there 
was no recurrence or metastasis.

Thyroid surgery may cause regional scarring and some degree of fibrotic process
which may extend into the perithyroidal soft tissues. This may result in problems
when collecting thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples and
evaluating the cellular abnormalities. This study aimed to determine if a history
of thyroid surgery is a risk factor for nondiagnostic (ND) FNAB results. Patients
with ≥1 discrete nodular lesion of the thyroid who underwent FNAB were included. 
The patients with a history of thyroid surgery constituted group 1, and the
others constituted group 2. The factors which may influence FNAB results,
including age, gender, presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and ultrasound
characteristics, were also evaluated. Group 1 included 123 patients with 200
nodules, and group 2 included 132 patients with 200 nodules. The two groups were 
similar with respect to demographic characteristics of the patients and
ultrasonographic features of the nodules including diameter, content (cystic or
solid), echogenicity, margin, and calcifications (P > 0.05). In all, 176 (44 %)
of the participants had ND FNAB results. The median time interval between thyroid
surgery and FNAB was 15 years [range, 1-45 years; interquartile range (IQR) 13
years]. Significantly more nodules in group 1 had ND FNAB results than in group 2
[98 (49 %) vs 78 (39 %), respectively, P = 0.028]. Multivariate analysis revealed
that history of thyroid surgery was independently associated with ND FNAB [odds
ratio (OR) 1.55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1-2.33, P = 0.033]. A history of
thyroid surgery increases the risk of initial ND FNAB.

Perinatology, Ankara, Turkey.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be a cause of fetal morbidity and mortality among
approximately 1% of pregnancies. With an aim to detect CMV antigenemia among 51
pregnant women with/without clinically diagnosed abnormalities and intrauterine
growth retardation (IUGR) maternal and fetal samples either prenatal (n:22) or
postpartum (n:29) were obtained between 17-42 weeks of gestation to analyze
anti-CMV IgG, IgM antibodies and cytoplasmic or nuclear CMV antigens. Cytoplasmic
and nuclear CMV antigenemia was detected among 19.6% and 11.8% of maternal
samples. These values were 29.4% and 17.6% for fetal samples. Among both maternal
and fetal samples, there was a 100% correlation when IgG and IgM were negative.
The correlation for IgG and IgM positivity was not present among maternal samples
since cytoplasmic (37.5%) and nuclear (25%) antigens could not be demonstrated in
spite of immunity. Cytoplasmic and nuclear CMV antigens were detected within
fetal samples from subjects presenting maternal immunoglobulin positivity,
clinical abnormality and clinically normal findings (50, 32, 16.7% and 50, 16,
5.6%) respectively. In conclusion, immunocytochemical detection of CMV
antigenemia improves CMV infection diagnosis which may be associated with
clinical abnormalities/IUGR.

Research Hospital, 06100 Ankara, Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is the second cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Delayed diagnosis leads to high mortality rates. Eotaxin-1 was
originally discovered as an eosinophil-selective chemoattractant and may play a
role in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and other
gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to analyse diagnostic and
prognostic significance of serum eotaxin-1 (s-eotaxin-1) levels in gastric
cancer.
METHODS: Sixty gastric cancer patients and 69 healthy subjects were included into
the study. S-eotaxin-1 levels were compared with clinicopathological features and
outcomes in gastric cancer.
RESULTS: Serum levels of eotaxin-1 in gastric cancer patients were significantly 
higher than controls (74.51 ± 16.65 pg/mL versus 16.79 ± 5.52 pg/mL, respectively
(P < 0.001)). The s-eotaxin-1 levels did not differ significantly with
histopathological grade, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, tumor localization,
lymph node metastases, positive lymph node ratio, size, perineural and
perivascular invasion. So there is no relationship found between s-eotaxin-1
level and prognosis.
CONCLUSION: S-eotaxin-1 levels may be used as an easily available biomarker for
gastric cancer risk and may alert physicians for early diagnosis. Due to the
limited number of patients included in this study, larger cohort studies are
warranted to validate the diagnostic value of s-eotaxin-1 level in gastric
cancer.

Hastanesi, KBB Klinigi, 51000 Nigde, Turkey.

AIM: This study aims to investigate the possible role of H. pylori as a cause of 
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
METHOD: This controlled study was performed with 31 consecutive laryngeal cancer 
and 28 cancer-free patients who underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of
laryngeal lesions. To document the previous H. pylori infection, serological
analysis of the antibody titers was done. Immunohistochemical analyses were
applied to the tissue samples.
RESULTS: Serology was found positive at the 90.3% of the laryngeal cancer
patients and 96.4% of the benign group. There were no statistically significant
differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis
results were determined as negative at all of the specimens of laryngeal cancer
patients and patients with benign lesions.
CONCLUSION: There were no signs of colonization of H. pylori in laryngeal tissues
of both groups' patients. It is thought that no relationship exists between the
H. pylori infection and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Methylation profile analysis of DNA repair genes in hepatocellular carcinoma with
MS-MLPA.

Ozer O(1), Bilezikci B, Aktas S, Sahin FI.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Genetics, Pathology, and General Surgery, Faculty of
Medicine, Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the rare tumors with well-defined risk
factors. The multifactorial etiology of HCC can be explained by its complex
molecular pathogenesis. In the current study, the methylation status of 7 genes
involved in DNA repair mechanisms, namely MLH1, PMS2, MSH6, MSH2, MGMT, MSH3, and
MLH3, was investigated in tumor samples from HCC patients, using the
methylation-specific-multiplex ligated probe amplification method and the results
were correlated with available clinical findings. The most common etiological
factor in these cases was the presence of hepatitis B alone (47.2%). Among the 56
cases that were studied, promoter methylation was detected in at least one of the
genes in 27 (48.2%) cases, only in 1 gene in 13 (23.2%) cases, and in >1 gene in 
14 (25%) cases. Of the 7 genes investigated, methylation was most frequently
observed in MSH3, in 14 (25%) cases. Methylation of at least 1 gene was
significantly more frequent in patients with single tumors than multifocal
tumors. There were significant differences regarding hepatitis B status, Child
Class, tumor number, grade, and TNM stage in cases where PMS2 methylation was
detected. Our results suggest that methylation of genes involved in mismatch
repair may be responsible in the pathogenesis of HCC, and evaluating changes in
multiple genes in these pathways simultaneously would be more informative.
Despite being a robust and relatively inexpensive method, the
methylation-specific-multiplex ligated probe amplification assay could be more
extensively applied with improvements in the currently intricate data analysis
component.

Tularemia in differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy: cytologic
features of tularemia lymphadenitis.

Markoc F(1), Koseoglu RD, Koc S, Gurbuzler L.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty of Gaziosmanpasa University, Tokat,
Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Tularemia can cause cervical lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) cytology is the first step in the workup for cervical lymphadenopathy;
however, little has been published regarding the cytomorphological features of
tularemia lymphadenitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the FNA cytology
of tularemia lymphadenitis.
STUDY DESIGN: Review of medical records identified 36 patients with serologically
proven tularemia, and who had undergone lymph node FNA. In each case, the
original May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained FNA smears from enlarged cervical lymph node
were reevaluated.
RESULTS: Suppuration and cytolysis were frequent cytological findings.
Twenty-three (63.8%) of the 36 cases were assessed as suppurative inflammation.
In 10 of these cases (27.8% of the total), cytolysis was prominent. In 7 cases
(19.4%) the smears featured microgranulomas as well as suppuration, and 2 of
these (5.6%) also featured giant cells. In 1 case (2.8%), there was caseous
necrosis. In 2 cases (5.6%), the cytopathological findings were consistent with
reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Three aspirates (8.3%) were inadequate for
evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Cytopathological findings on FNA of tularemia lymphadenitis are
nonspecific; however, in regions where tularemia is endemic, this disease should 
be considered in the differential diagnosis for suppurative lymphadenitis.

‡Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey.

Computed tomography (CT) is capable of providing accurate and measurable
3-dimensional images of the third molar. The aims of this study were to analyze
the development of the mandibular third molar and its relation to chronological
age and to create new reference data for a group of Turkish participants aged 9
to 25 years on the basis of cone-beam CT images. All data were obtained from the 
patients' records including medical, social, and dental anamnesis and cone-beam
CT images of 752 patients. Linear regression analysis was performed to obtain
regression formulas for dental age calculation with chronological age and to
determine the coefficient of determination (r) for each sex. Statistical analysis
showed a strong correlation between age and third-molar development for the males
(r2 = 0.80) and the females (r2 = 0.78). Computed tomographic images are
clinically useful for accurate and reliable estimation of dental ages of children
and youth.

This study was performed to determine the hepatotoxicity of
di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) in relation to selenium status. In 3-week-old
Sprague-Dawley rats, selenium deficiency was induced by a ≤0.05 selenium mg/kg. A
selenium supplementation group was given 1 mg selenium/kg diet for 5 weeks.
Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate-treated groups received 1000 mg/kg dose by gavage
during the last 10 days of the experiment. Histopathology, peroxisome
proliferation, catalase (CAT) immunoreactivity and activity and apoptosis were
assessed. Activities of antioxidant selenoenzymes [glutathione peroxidase 1
(GPx1), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1)],
superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione S-transferase (GST);
aminotransferase, total glutathione (tGSH), and lipid peroxidation (LP) levels
were measured. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate caused cellular disorganization while
necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in Se-deficient DEHP
group (DEHP/SeD). Catalase activity and immunoreactivity were increased in all
DEHP-treated groups. Glutathione peroxidase 1 and GPx4 activities decreased
significantly in DEHP and DEHP/SeD groups, while GST activities decreased in all 
DEHP-exposed groups. Thioredoxin reductase activity increased in DEHP and
DEHP/SeS, while total SOD activities increased in all DEHP-treated groups. Lipid 
peroxidation levels increased significantly in SeD (26%), DEHP (38%) and DEHP/SeD
(71%) groups. Selenium supplementation partially ameliorated DEHP-induced
hepatotoxicity; while in DEHP/SeD group, drastic changes in hepatic
histopathology and oxidative stress parameters were observed.

Human kallikreins (hKs) have been reported to be involved in human cancers, and
several hKs are promising biomarkers of various cancers, such as prostate,
ovarian, breast, and testicular cancer. In the present study, we aimed to
evaluate the prognostic value of immunohistochemical expression of hK11 in
patients with gastric cancer. The study included 55 (36 men and 19 women; 58 ± 10
years of mean age) patients with gastric cancer treated with surgery and adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy. Tissue sections were evaluated immunohistochemically with a
monoclonal anti-hK11 antibody. Of the 55 patients, 35 (63.6%) were hK11-positive 
and 20 (36.4%) were hK11-negative. Disease-free and overall survival rates were
significantly higher in patients with hK11 positive than in those with hK-11
negative expression (24 months vs. 11 months, p: 0.043; 29 months vs. 13 months, 
p: 0.038, respectively). In conclusion, hK11 expression in gastric cancer appears
to be associated with a better prognosis. hK11 may be a prognostic biomarker of
gastric cancer. On the other hand, it is needed to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying the regulation of hK11 expression in gastric cancer.

Differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenitis mimicking malignancy due to
tularemia: our experiences.

Turhan V(1), Berber U, Haholu A, Salihoglu M, Ulcay A.

Author information:

Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Tularemia is a disease caused by a Gram-negative coccobacillus
Francisella tularensis. This bacterium may cause different types of clinical
pictures owing to acquisition route and entrance site, such as ulceroglandular,
oropharyngeal, glandular, pneumonic, typhoid and ocular forms. Oropharyngeal
tularemia (OPT) is the most common form of tularemia in some regions. OPT may
cause tonsillopharyngitis followed by cervical lymphadenopathies (LAPs). Without 
treatment LAP may persist for several months and may mimic other diseases causing
cervical LAPs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of six cases of OPT, five male and one female,
between 21 and 31 years old, diagnosed serologically and clinically recorded in
GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital were included in this study. Detailed story
including the region they lived for last 6 months, their occupation, family and
neighborhood story with similar complaints were obtained. Patient data were also 
obtained from manually written patients files and electronical patient file
system. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks of all biopsy material
were submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study for F. tularensis.
RESULTS: A total of six cases with head and neck mass following a story of
tonsillopharyngitis admitted to different clinics including infectious diseases, 
ear-nose-throat and internal medicine in our tertiary care hospital. Physical
examination revealed immobile, hard, conglomerated unilateral cervical
lymphadenopathy in all cases. Histopathological examination revealed
granulomatous inflammation in four cases. Acute suppurative inflammatory changes 
were also seen in two cases. Large necrotic areas mimicking casseifying necrosis 
were seen in two cases. PCR amplification of F. tularensis genom from isolated
deoxyribonucleic acids was successful in five cases.
CONCLUSION: Tularemia should be kept in mind in patients with tonsillopharyngitis
not responding to penicillins and beta lactam antibiotics. Furthermore,
persisting LAPs mimicking tumor with or without the story of previously
experienced sore throat or tonsillopharyngitis in past few days or weeks should
be evaluated for glandular or OPT. At this point, easily applicable serological
tests such as tularemia micro-agglutination tests will confirm the diagnosis of
OPT. However, if lymph node were already sampled to exclude especially malignancy
or T cell lymphoma, tularemia PCR test may be used to make a certain diagnosis.

Turkey.

INTRODUCTION AND AIM: To assess the impact of new alternative solutions to
formaldehyde and xylene on tissue processing, 13 different tissue processings
were designed and performed on thirteen different tissues by using five different
fixatives (formaldehyde, Glyo-Fixx®, FineFix®, Cell-block®, Green-Fix®) and four 
different clearing agents (xylene, Sub-X®, Bio-clear®, Shandon Xylene
Substitute®).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hematoxylin and Eosine stained sections were compared by
using qualitative histomorphological criterions. Histochemical and
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining results were compared with qualitative and
quantitative data obtained by a computer program, respectively. Tissue sections
were tested for the availability of chromogenic in situ hybridization,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, and DNA
quality by polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The quality of sections was well for all tissue processings. All
alternative solutions were suitable for histochemistry. IHC staining results
showed that alternative solutions that contain glyoxal as active agent need
optimization for this application. The clearance of signals with chromogenic in
situ hybridization were nearly same and well for all tissue samples. Furthermore,
tissue processes that do not contain formaldehyde were found to be superior on
preservation of nucleic acids.
CONCLUSION: Formaldehyde-free fixatives and alternative clearing agents have
potential in routine pathology and research to replace formaldehyde and xylene.

Clinical and histopathological characteristics of cutaneous Leishmaniasis in
Sanliurfa City of Turkey including Syrian refugees.

Koçarslan S(1), Turan E, Ekinci T, Yesilova Y, Apari R.

Author information:

Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical and
histopathological characteristics of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the city of 
Sanliurfa in Turkey, where Syrian refugees also reside.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the Harran University Hospital outpatient clinics
between 2012 and 2013, 54 CL cases, including 24 Syrian patients, underwent punch
biopsy of the skin and/or a touch imprint. Patients in whom leishmania parasites 
were detected were included in the study. The clinical and histopathological data
of the patients were obtained by a review of the patients' medical records. All
the slides of each patient were re-evaluated histopathologically.
RESULTS: Fifty-four cases (mean age; 17 ± 12 years), consisting of 32 males
(59.3%) and 22 females (40.7%), were examined. The most common site of
involvement was the face (63%). The most common presentation was noduloulcerative
lesions (57.4%). Histopathologically, the majority of the cases exhibited
hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging of the epidermis, chronic inflammatory
infiltration, leishmania amastigotes and non-caseating granulomatous inflammation
in the dermis.
CONCLUSION: CL presents with a wide spectrum of expression, both clinically and
histologically, and may mimic other inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. The
diagnosis of CL relies on the identification of leishmania amastigotes in either 
a direct smear of the lesion or in a tissue section.

Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia: histomorphological and
immunohistochemical features.

Akdur NC(1), Donmez M, Gozel S, Ustun H, Hucumenoglu S.

Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. mdonmezm@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH) is a benign
intravascular process with features mimicking other benign and malignant vascular
proliferations. IPEH lesions predominate in the head-neck region and the
extremities. The characteristic histomorphological feature of IPEH is a papillary
structure covered with hyperplastic endothelial cells within the vascular lumen. 
It is critical that this clinically benign lesion should not be mistaken for
well-differentiated vascular tumors. In addition to the characteristic
histological features, other useful diagnostic features included the
intra-luminal location of the lesion, an intimate association with the organizing
thrombus, the absence of necrosis, cellular pleomorphism, and mitotic activity.
In addition, immunohistochemistry may indicate the vascular origin and
proliferative index. In this study, we evaluated histomorphological and
immunohistochemical findings (CD31, CD34, FVIII, type IV collagen, SMA, MSA,
CD105, and Ki-67 staining) of ten IPEH cases.
METHODS: Ten IPEH cases were re-examined for a panel of histomorphological and
immunohistochemical features. CD31, CD34, FVIII, Type IV collagen, SMA and MSA
antibodies utilized for immunohistochemical analysis.The histomorphological and
immunohistochemical findings were evaluated by two independent pathologists using
light microscopy.
RESULTS: All ten cases involved intraluminal lesions with characteristic features
of IPEH. All ten cases (100%) were stained positive for CD31 and CD34. The degree
of staining with FVIII, type IV collagen, SMA, and MSA was variable.
CONCLUSION: In this series of specimens, CD31 and CD34 were the most sensitive
markers indicating the vascular origin of the lesion. Staining for the other
vascular markers (FVIII, type IV collagen, SMA and MSA) was variable. Different
maturation degrees of lesions may account for the variation in
immunohistochemical staining. Few previous investigations evaluated a wide range 
of antigen panels in IPEH sections. In our opinion, the evaluation of immune
markers in a larger sample set will reveal new features in the maturity and
developmental pathogenesis of vascular lesions and angiogenesis. IPEH is a benign
lesion, which must be differentiated from malignant tumors such as angiosarcoma
and Kaposi's sarcoma. Improved definition of IPEH lesions using
immunohistochemical markers may enhance the ability to differentiate between
various vascular lesions.

Is the low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/atypical squamous cells cannot
exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion category associated with
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2?

Cetiner H(1), Kır G, Kaygusuz E, Sağlıcan Y, Kabaca C.

OBJECTIVE: A number of cervical smears may exhibit unequivocal low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) in association with atypical cells
cytomorphologically suspicious, but not sufficient to be interpreted as
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). These lesions are presently
called LSIL, atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (LSIL/ASC-H). Previous
studies have shown that LSIL/ASC-H and ASC-H are both equivocal for HSIL and have
a high risk of underlying HSIL. However, in researching the literature only two
studies were found which rendered the results as cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN) 2 and CIN3 separately. The purpose of this study was to compare
the distribution of biopsy results for CIN2 and CIN3 in patients with ASC-H,
HSIL, and LSIL/ASC-H.
STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2005 and December 2011, cervicovaginal smears
(98,594) with a diagnosis of ASC-H, LSIL, LSIL/ASC-H, or HSIL were re-evaluated
to determine the prevalence of future lesion development.
RESULTS: A total of 252 patients who had histologic follow-up within a year were 
selected. Among these, LSIL/ASC-H (31.7%) had the highest prevalence of CIN2
between LSIL (9.3%), ASC-H (10%), and HSIL (16%). All differences were
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Because of the high predictive value of CIN2, LSIL/ASC-H may have
further importance, especially in women of different age groups.

In this study, histopathologic changes following carbaryl exposure for 96 hr were
investigated in the digestive tract of Levantine frog, Pelophylax bedriagae.
Adult frogs were exposed to carbaryl once by oral gavage in concentrations of
0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/g. Histopathological changes were more prominent in medium-
(0.1 mg/g) and high-dose (0.2 mg/g) groups than in the low-dose (0.05 mg/g)
group. Esophageal cells showed vacuolization, cellular swelling, nuclear
pyknosis, karyolysis, and necrosis. Additionally, esophageal glandular atrophy
and infiltration of inflammatory cells around esophageal glands were observed at 
medium and high doses. In the stomach, there were prominent histopathologic
defects such as cellular swelling and necrosis in gastric glands, necrotic cells 
within the interstitial spaces, separation of epithelial cell layer, congested
vessels, and hemorrhage at medium and high doses. In the intestine, detachment of
epithelial layer, epithelial cell disorganization, inflammation, and necrosis
were detected at medium and high doses. The results of this study showed that
carbaryl caused adverse effects on the digestive tract of the Levantine frog, P. 
bedriagae.

Importance of P53, Ki-67 expression in the differential diagnosis of
benign/malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast.

Kucuk U(1), Bayol U, Pala EE, Cumurcu S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Tepecik Research and Training Hospital, Izmir,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Conventionally growth pattern, stromal overgrowth, stromal
cellularity and stromal mitotic activity are the main parameters in the grading
of phyllodes tumors (PTs). Recent studies revealed that both p53 and Ki-67
expressions are correlated with grade of PTs of the breast. Expression of hormone
receptors and overexpression/amplification of HER2 has been studied in PTs to
discover the roles of these markers as new treatment modalities.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: We studied 26 PT cases. Seventeen benign and nine malignant
PTs were re-evaluated as regards stromal cellularity mitotic activity, p53/Ki-67 
expression rates and the relation between these parameters. Estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor (ER, PR) positivity were determined by counting nuclear
staining in five high-power fields. Also, the presence of any HER2 staining and
staining patterns were documanted.
RESULTS: Stromal cellularity, mitotic rate, p53 and Ki-67 expression rates were
all correlated with benign and malignant histologic subgroups (P = 0.000-0.001). 
Ki-67 and p53 expressions were statistically significantly correlated with
histologic subgroups, stromal cellularity and mitotic rate (P < 0.005). ER and PR
expressions in the epithelial component were not statistically significant
between the two groups. HER2 showed different staining patterns in the epithelial
component, and there was no staining in the stromal component.
CONCLUSION: Ki-67 and p53 expression rates were statistically significantly
correlated with grade of mammary PTs; therefore, they can be used in the
determination of tumor grade, especially for the differential diagnosis of benign
and malignant tumors. Malignant and benign tumors did not differ significantly in
terms of hormone receptor and HER2 expression. HER2 expression showed different
patterns in the epithelial component of the PTs.

Estrogens exert a protective effect against hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Loss 
of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in the liver is associated with hepatic
steatosis and inflammation in animal models. We conducted a study in order to
investigate the presence and extent of ER-α expression in HCV infection, and its 
relationship with histological and biochemical findings. Ninety biopsy-proven
chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients were enrolled in the study. Liver biopsy
specimens were immunohistochemically stained for ER-α expression. Nuclear ER-α
expression percentage was calculated. ER-α was positive in 69 of the patients
(76%). ER-α positive and negative groups were not significantly different in
terms of age, gender, necroinflammatory activity, fibrosis, steatosis, serum
levels of AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and bilirubin. ER-α expression percentage was not
correlated with fibrosis, steatosis, necroinflammatory activity and biochemical
findings. Although estrogens are known to be protective against fibrosis and
steatosis in animal models, we did not find any significant correlation between
ER-α expression and histopathological and biochemical findings in CHC patients.
These findings should be verified in further large scale studies.

Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in gastric adenocarcinoma: impact on
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Lymphatic metastasis is the most important parameter in the spread of
gastric carcinomas. Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that plays an
important role in inflammation and carcinogenesis. In this study, the possible
link between inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression with
lymphangiogenesis and the clinicopathological parameters of gastric carcinomas
was investigated.
METHODS: In this study, iNOS expression and D2-40 (lymphatic endothelium-specific
marker monoclonal antibody) reactivity were examined immunohistochemically in 41 
gastric adenocarcinoma and 20 non-neoplastic gastric tissues. iNOS expression was
scored semiquantitatively in the tumor parenchyma and stroma. D2-40-positive
lymphatic vessels were used in the determination of lymphatic invasion and
intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatic vascular density.
RESULTS: iNOS expression was higher in gastric carcinoma tissue compared with
non-neoplastic tissue. Particularly, iNOS expression in tumor cells was found to 
be closely related to lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis. The density of 
lymphatic invasion as well as intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatic vascular
density were positively correlated with lymph node metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that iNOS-mediated NO formation plays an
important role in gastric carcinogenesis, tumor lymphangiogenesis, and the
development of lymphatic metastases. Inhibition of the NO pathway may be an
alternative treatment of gastric carcinomas.

Immunosuppressive patients are at risk of fungal and bacterial infections.
Therefore, these patients receive prophylactic, preemptive, empirical or target
antifungal and concomitant antibiotic therapy. To this end, caspofungin (CAS) or 
voriconazole (VRC) antifungals and cefoperazone-sulbactam (CPZ/SAM) or
piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) antibiotics may be used. Here, we aimed to
investigate the interaction between these antifungals and antibiotics by in vitro
and in vivo methods. The interaction was tested by chequerboard analysis and
fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). It was also tested in a
neutropenic mice-invasive candidiasis model and evaluated by fungal burden in
kidney tissue of infected animals from the first day to the fifth day of
treatment with 24 h intervals. A synergism was detected between CAS and CPZ/SAM
(FICI = 0.1) and PIP/TAZ (FICI = 0.3). Fungal burden in tissues of drug-treated
mice was reduced compared with controls in a time-dependent manner. In comparison
with CAS-alone treated group, there were 1.32 log10 reductions of fungal burden
in CAS + CPZ/SAM (p = 0.002) and in CAS + PIP/TAZ group (p = 0.14). The same
interactions were not found with VRC and antibiotics. CPZ/SAM had stronger
synergistic interaction with CAS than PIP/TAZ. The mechanism of synergism is not 
well understood. This is most likely due to an increase in the anticandidal
effect of CAS plus antibiotics.

and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether the presence of Hürthle cells altered
the distribution of categories in the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid
cytopathology, or the expected neoplastic and malignant outcome.
METHODS: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology reports of Hürthle cells in a
2-year period were evaluated. The distribution of Bethesda system categories and 
the outcome at partial or complete thyroidectomy were compared for FNAs with and 
without Hürthle cells.
RESULTS: Of 895 adequate FNAs with Hürthle cells, 764 (85.4%) were classified as 
benign, 86 (9.6%) as atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of
undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), 32 (3.6%) as follicular neoplasm/suspicious
for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN), 12 (1.3%) as suspicious for malignancy (SFM)
and one (0.1%) as malignant. Of 10 359 adequate FNAs without Hürthle cells, 9707 
(93.7%) were classified as benign, 412 (4.0%) as AUS/FLUS, 77 (0.7%) as FN/SFN,
93 (0.9%) as SFM and 70 (0.7%) as malignant. The distribution of categories in
FNAs with and without Hürthle cells was significantly different (P < 0.001) as a 
result of a decrease in benign and an increase in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN categories.
Among 128 patients with and 582 without Hürthle cells undergoing surgery, the
overall neoplastic and malignancy rates were higher in the former than in the
latter group (27.3% versus 14.9%, P < 0.001; 21.1% versus 11.7%, P = 0.003;
respectively). Although neoplastic and malignant rates were higher in the group
with than without Hürthle cells in all categories, the differences were only
significant for a neoplastic outcome of benign cytology (15.1% versus 6.0%,
P = 0.0013) and a malignant outcome of FN/SFN cytology (63.6% versus 21.9%,
P = 0.0108).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the rates of AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN categories in the
Bethesda system were higher when Hürthle cells were present. After surgery,
neoplastic and malignant outcomes were significantly higher in the Hürthle cell
group.

This study investigates the impact of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on blood
vessels, specifically on the development of intussusceptive angiogenesis in
cutaneous wound healing. Excisional wounds were formed on both sides of the
medulla spinalis in dorsal location of the rats. The control and EGF-treated
groups were divided into two groups with respect to sacrifice day: 5 d and 7 d.
EGF was topically applied to the EGF-treated group once a day. The wound tissue
was removed from rats, embedded in araldite and paraffin, and then examined under
transmission electron and light microscopes. The ultrastructural signs of
intussusceptive angiogenesis, such as intraluminal protrusion of endothelial
cells and formation of the contact zone of opposite endothelial cells, were
observed in the wound. Our statistical analyses, based on light microscopy
observations, also confirm that EGF treatment induces intussusceptive
angiogenesis. Moreover, we found that induction of EGF impact on intussusceptive 
angiogenesis is higher on the 7th day of treatment than on the 5th day. This
implies that the duration of EGF treatment is important. This research clarifies 
the effects of EGF on the vessels and proves that EGF induces intussusceptive
angiogenesis, being a newer model with respect to sprouting type.

Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the efficacy of the Bethesda system
(TBS) for reporting thyroid cytopathology in determining the risk of malignancy
for indeterminate cases. These cases comprised atypia or follicular lesion of
undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), follicular neoplasia or suspicious for
follicular neoplasia (FN/SFN) and suspicious for malignancy (SM) categories.
AUS/FLUS cases were further subcategorized according to their patterns, and the
malignancy rate for each subcategory was calculated.
METHODS: A total of 6310 thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) cases were analysed
and 655 indeterminate cases were enrolled in the study. AUS/FLUS cases were
further subcategorized into four patterns as follows: papillary thyroid carcinoma
(PTC) pattern, microfollicle pattern, atypical cell pattern and Hürthle cell
pattern.
RESULTS: Malignancy rates for AUS/FLUS, FN/SFN and SM were 18.9%, 45.7% and 71%, 
respectively. Malignancy rates for AUS/FLUS subcategories were as follows: PTC
pattern, 28%; microfollicle pattern, 6.9%; atypical cell pattern, 22.2%; and
Hürthle cell pattern, 0%.
CONCLUSION: The Bethesda system categorizes thyroid FNAs with increasing risk of 
malignancy as advocated. However, our findings suggest that the risk of
malignancy for AUS/FLUS might be higher than estimated. Particularly, AUS/FLUS
cases with focal features suggestive of PTC seem to be associated with a much
higher risk of malignancy than other patterns.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases that are clinically subdivided
as hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
(HER2(+)), and triple-negative breast cancer, to guide therapeutic interventions.
Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 are among the most successful 
cancer therapeutics. However, de novo or acquired resistance is common, despite
the development of newer agents against these pathways. As our understanding of
tumor biology improves, novel targets are being identified. Notably, inhibitors
against several pathways [including, among others, the phosphoinositide
3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR), cell-cycle regulation, heat
shock protein, and epigenetic pathways] have demonstrated promising activity in
clinical trials, and the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus has been approved for advanced
or metastatic aromatase inhibitor-resistant ER(+) breast cancer. At present,
there are no established targeted agents for triple-negative breast cancer
(negative ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2). Although poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-related cancers, its 
value in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers remains to be
demonstrated. In this Review, we present a basic understanding of the major
targeted agents in current practice and under development for the treatment of
breast cancer in the context of the three clinical subgroups.

OBJECTIVE: The biostimulation effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) have been
demonstrated recently. This study investigated the effects of LLLT on palatal
mucoperiosteal wound healing and oxidative stress status in rats.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Forty-two male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were used in
this study. A standardized full-thickness wound was created in the mucoperiosteum
of the hard palates of the rats using a 3-mm-diameter biopsy punch. Treatment
using a GaAlAs laser at a wavelength of 940 nm and a dose of 10 J/cm(2) was
initiated after surgery and repeated on the 2nd, 4th, and 6th days post-surgery. 
Seven animals from each group were sacrificed on the 7th, 14th, and 21st days
after surgery. Total antioxidant status and total oxidative status were measured 
in serum.
RESULTS: The histopathological findings revealed reduced numbers of inflammatory 
cells on the 7th day, increased mitotic activity of fibroblasts on the 14th and
21st day, and the same degree of collagen synthesis and vascularization on the
days 7, 14, and 21 in the LLLT group compared with the control group. No
significant differences in total oxidative status and total antioxidant status
were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSION: LLLT using a GaAlAs laser at a wavelength of 940 nm and a dose of 10 
J/cm(2) elicited a positive healing effect on palatal mucoperiosteal wounds
likely via the induction of fibroblasts. The oxidative stress status was not
affected by LLLT.

Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147) is a transmembrane
glycoprotein involved in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The 
study investigated CD147 and MMP-2 expression in epidermis of cutaneous squamous 
lesions. CD147 and MMP-2 expressions were evaluated immunohistochemically in 44
specimens: 18 actinic keratoses (AK), 6 squamous cell carcinomas in situ (SCCIS),
13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; peritumoral and invasive portions assessed),
and 7 normal skins. Patterns of expression were assessed, with MMP-2 in nuclei
(MMP-2n) and cytoplasm (MMP-2c) evaluated separately. The expression of each
marker was quantified using a calculated immunohistochemical/histologic score
(H-score). Correlations were analyzed for the marker H-scores in each study
group. Associations between H-scores and histopathologic parameters were also
evaluated. CD147 H-score was the highest in SCC (invasive islands), followed by
AK, SCCIS, and control specimens, respectively. MMP-2n and MMP-2c H-scores were
the highest in AK, followed by SCCIS, SCC, and control specimens, respectively.
MMP-2c and MMP-2n H-scores were significantly higher in peritumoral epidermis
than in invasive islands of SCC. MMP-2c and CD147 H-scores were positively
correlated in the peritumoral SCCs. CD147 H-score was positively correlated with 
tumor differentiation in SCC. The findings suggest that overexpression of CD147
plays a role in the development of SCC.

Turkey.

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, nasal cavity, and paranasal
sinuses can be misdiagnosed as primary malignant or benign diseases. A
33-year-old male attended our outpatient clinic complaining of difficulty
breathing through the nose, bloody nasal discharge, postnasal drop, snoring, and 
discharge of phlegm. Endoscopic nasopharyngeal examination showed a vascularized 
nasopharyngeal mass. Under general anesthesia, multiple punch biopsies were taken
from the nasopharynx. Pathologically, the tumor cells had clear cytoplasm and
were arranged in a trabecular pattern lined by a layer of endothelial cells.
After the initial pathological examination, the pathologist requested more
information about the patient's clinical status. A careful history revealed that 
the patient had undergone left a nephrectomy for a kidney mass diagnosed as renal
cell carcinoma 3 years earlier. Subsequently, nasopharyngeal metastatic renal
cell carcinoma was diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining with CD10 and
vimentin. Radiotherapy was recommended for treatment.

Koyuncuer A(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Goztepe Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinomas (UC) is of the most common cancers urinary
bladder.
AIM: The aim of the study is to assess the immunohistochemical staining
differences between p63 and p53 according to the pathological stage and
histological grade of the tumor in urinary bladder carcinomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally 62 urinary bladder transurethral resection
materials diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma in the pathology department of our 
hospital were included in the study. On pathological examination, cases were
dichotomized as noninvasive and invasive, whereas noninvasive cases were
dichotomized as low grade and high grade and invasive cases were dichotomized as 
pT1 and pT2. Subsequently, the cases were evaluated by means of p63 and p53
immunohistochemical staining. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS
program, and Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.
RESULTS: When pTa was evaluated in terms of p63 immunoreactivity, no
statistically significant difference was observed between LGPUC and HGPUC,
noninvasive papillary UC, regarding staining percentages ( P > 0.05), whereas
statistically significant relation was observed for pT1 and pT2 regarding p63
staining percentages ( P < 0.05). For pTa, no statistically significant relation 
was observed between LGPUC and HGPUC, noninvasive papillary UC, in terms of p53
staining percentages ( P > 0.05). However, highly significant relationship was
observed for pT1 and pT2 in terms of p53 staining percentages ( P < 0.01). No
significant relationship was observed between the staining percentages of p53 and
p63 ( P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The role of p53 and p63 immunoreactivities in the differential
diagnosis and prognosis of urinary bladder carcinomas according to the
pathological stage and histological grade of the tumor will be understood better 
with the increasing number of long term investigations performed with large
series at a molecular level.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of vitamin E in follicular
degeneration and to assess histopathological and biochemical changes following
ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in rat ovaries. Twenty-eight Wistar albino rats 
were randomly divided into four groups: sham, 4h torsion, 24h detorsion, and a
vitamin E group. Thirty minutes before detorsion, a single dose of 200mg/kg
vitamin E was administered intraperitoneally. The ovarian histology score was
determined, serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were 
measured. The apoptosis of granulosa cells and the phospho-c-jun N-terminal
kinase (p-JNK) and phospho-p38 (p-p38) immunoreactivities of these cells were
determined. MDA and MPO levels were significantly increased in the torsion and
detorsion groups. Hemorrhage, edema, and congestion were also apparent in these
groups. In addition, the apoptotic index and the immunoreactivity of p-JNK were
highest in the detorsion group, which also showed marked follicular degeneration.
However, p-p38 activity was not affected by torsion-detorsion (TD) induction.
Vitamin E ameliorated TD-induced histological alterations. It also decreased
serum levels of MDA and MPO, reduced the activity of p-JNK in the ovaries, and
reduced numbers of apoptotic follicular cells. In conclusion, these data indicate
that vitamin E attenuated ovarian follicular degeneration by inhibiting the
immunoreactivity of p-JNK and reducing the apoptosis of granulosa cells.

In contrast to breast HER2 testing, the optimal ISH method and antibody for
gastric HER2 testing are unclear. The aim of this study was to find out gastric
HER2 positivity rates in our institutional data, and to compare the two novel ISH
methods with A0485 antibody and HercepTest™. IHC and ISH were carried out on
gastrectomy specimens of 88 patients up to the standardly advised procedure
protocols, and interpretations were also carried out up to widely accepted
international protocols., HER2 expression was (-) in 65, (+) in 5, (++) in 6, and
(+++) in 12 cases by A0485 IHC. IHC (+) 4 cases and (++) 3 cases were (-) by
HercepTest™. One IHC (-) amplified case was (++) by HercepTest™. All A0485 and
HercepTest™ (+++) 12 cases were amplified by ISH. HER2 amplification was detected
in 18 (20.4%) and in 15 (17.2%) cases by SISH and FISH, respectively. Of the 18
cases, 4 showed focal heterogeneous low level amplification by SISH. Focal
amplification was noted in only 2 cases by FISH. The HER2 status of our gastric
cancer file is 17.2% by FISH, 20.4% by SISH. The concordance between
HercepTest™/A0485 IHC and ISH is perfect in (+++) cases. Equivocal results (++)
with any IHC method should be clarified by one of the molecular methods (SISH and
FISH). Probably up to the higher level of heterogeneity of gastric carcinomas,
there is a 4.5% dilemma of cases that are negative or weakly positive by
conventional IHC methods. Therefore, regarding HER2 status in gastric carcinoma, 
the reliability of IHC methods should be checked.

University, Turkey.

Ramadan is a holy month for Muslim people and includes long fasting periods.
During Ramadan, practicing Muslims not only fast, but they also abstain from any 
kind of medication, smoking, sexual intercourse, and alcohol from sunrise to
sunset. In the 10-year period between 2000 and 2009, it was determined that a
total of 4881 death examinations and autopsies were performed at the Konya Branch
of the Forensic Medicine Council (Turkey). All of the reports were
retrospectively evaluated for demographic features of the cases and the manner of
death. In the studied time period, a total of 491 deaths (10.1%) occurred in
Ramadan. The manner of death was accident in 369 (75.2%) of the cases in Ramadan,
3107 (70.8%) of the other cases; suicide in 27 (5.5%) of the cases in Ramadan,
367 (8.4%) of the other cases; and homicide in 28 (5.7%) of the cases in Ramadan,
375 (8.5%) of the other cases. There was a significant statistical difference in 
terms of the manner of death between the deaths in Ramadan and in the remaining
part of the year (P < 0.05). Our study suggested that there was an increase in
accidental and natural deaths and a decrease in suicide and homicides in Ramadan.

OBJECTIVE: Appropriate clinical management of a hepatic mass depends on its
accurate diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of
percutaneous fine needle aspiration cytopathology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of
suspicious liver masses in our center.
STUDY DESIGN: Cytopathology and histopathology databases were searched for
patients undergoing combined, image-guided percutaneous FNAC and biopsy sampling 
of liver mass lesions in 2006-2011. All patients had one or more radiologically
detected lesion and clinical suspicion of neoplastic disease. Sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy of FNAC in the diagnosis of liver lesions were
determined using histopathological diagnoses on liver biopsy as a gold standard.
RESULTS: Of 101 patients, cytopathological diagnoses were nonneoplastic in 10
cases while 10 cases were suspicious for neoplasms and 71 were malignant. In 10
patients (9.9%), FNA samples were inadequate for assessment. Final
histopathological diagnoses were nonneoplastic in 7 cases, benign tumoral in 5
and malignant in 89 cases (88.1%). Of the malignancies, 22 (24.7%) were
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and 60 (67.4%) were metastatic tumors on final
clinicohistopathological analysis. The remaining 7 (7.8%) patients had other
primary hepatic malignancies. Fifteen of the 22 (68.2%) HCC cases were
specifically diagnosed by FNAC. In 28 of the metastatic tumors, the primary organ
site was unknown, followed by gastrointestinal malignancies in 17 cases. Overall,
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values
of FNAC in the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions were 96.3, 90.0, 95.6, 98.7 and
75.0%, respectively. Discrepancy in cyto-/histopathological data was mainly seen 
in nonrepresentative FNAC cases.
CONCLUSION: FNAC of liver masses is a highly accurate technique that can be used 
to identify the majority of primary/metastatic hepatic neoplasias with high
specificity. A combined cyto-/histopathological approach provides higher accuracy
in the diagnosis and typing of hepatic tumors, which may affect therapeutic
decisions. Correlation of cytopathology with clinicoradiological findings is
helpful to increase overall accuracy of the procedure.

Interactions of actinomyces -like organisms with host cells: light microscopic
examination.

Akyüzlü DK(1), Demirezen S, Beksaç MS.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Forensic Sciences, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the interactions of Actinomyces-like organisms (ALOs)
with host cells, including vaginal epithelial cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(PMNLs) and erythrocytes, using Pap smear microscopy and based on their light
microscopic appearances.
STUDY DESIGN: Cervicovaginal samples obtained from 200 patients were examined by 
both Pap smear microscopy and anaerobic culturing. Since the results obtained by 
these methods were not concordant for diagnosis of genital Actinomyces, the
results of Pap smear microscopy were used as a reference, and the smears with
ALOs were carefully screened with regard to interactions of ALOs with host cells.
RESULTS: ALOs were detected as attached to vaginal epithelial cells, PMNLs and
erythrocytes via their filament-like structures. At some attachment sites, the
epithelial cell membrane and filaments of ALOs were almost fused with each other.
A group of PMNLs surrounded the ALOs. However, ALOs were observed to form
colonies to evade phagocytosis by PMNLs. At the connection points between
erythrocytes and ALOs, the findings of interest were the changes in the shapes of
the erythrocytes and filament-like structures of the ALOs on the erythrocyte
membrane.
CONCLUSIONS: The adhesiveness of ALOs can be observed in routine
Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears at light microscopic level.

MCM3 protein expression in follicular and classical variants of papillary thyroid
carcinoma.

Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are needed as licensors in the DNA
replication of eukaryotic cells and transcriptional control of MCM genes has
critical role in the regulation of MCM functions. Different MCM protein family
members are proposed as diagnostic or prognostic markers in various cancers due
to their increased proliferative potential. Among MCM family members,
minichromosome maintenance protein 3 (MCM3) expressions in both mRNA and protein 
levels were shown to be associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). But,
the usability of MCM3 in some histological variants of PTC might be controversial
due to tissue specific molecular heterogeneities. In follicular variant of
papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC), a number of genes including MCM3 were shown 
to be differentially expressed which were specific to this kind of variant. Using
immunohistochemistry method, MCM3 protein expression levels were compared in
FVPTC, classic variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (CVPTC), and multi-nodular 
goiter (MNG) tissues in a group of 32 cases. There was meaningful differences
between MNG vs. FVPTC (p = 0.016) and MNG vs. CVPTC (p = 0.019) while there was
no significant difference in the comparison FVPTC vs. CVPTC (p = 0.15). Four of
the 5 CVPTC cases having surrounding tissue invasion had high expression values. 
For FVPTC and CVPTC, MCM3 protein expression results were parallel to our
previous mRNA expression study while there was downregulation in protein
expression despite the increased expression of MCM3 mRNA in MNG suggesting
tissue-specific post-transcriptional events in benign thyroid neoplasms of which 
should be focused on. Moreover, the relatively lower MCM3 protein expression in
FVPTC comparing to CVPTC could be due to a different tumorigenic pathway favored 
in this type of tissue.

Are we counting mitoses correctly?

The number of mitotic figures in a predefined area is essential in pathologic
evaluation for most tumors. This information sometimes provides clues in
differentiating neoplastic lesions from nonneoplastic ones and sometimes in
defining and grading of the tumors as well as prognosticating expected lifetime
of the patient. As a generally accepted concept, scanning a certain number of
consecutive nonoverlapping areas that are rich in viable tumor cells is required.
Invasion fronts or the periphery of the tumors is preferred for counting mitosis.
The target area to be counted for mitotic activity for various tumors is
standardized as the number of mitosis in an established number of high-power
fields. However, suggested mitotic counts, which constitute the basis of these
studies, were obtained via the old microscopes, which usually had narrower visual
fields than the state-of-the-art microscopes. Because the visual fields of the
present microscopes provide larger areas compared with the older ones,
corrections in mitosis counting are needed to make them compatible with the
criteria, which had been put forward in the original reference studies.

Recurrence of meningiomas is a major prognostic issue. Although World Health
Organization (WHO) histopathological grading correlates strongly with recurrence,
it has some limitations, and predicting the biological behavior of grade I
meningiomas is particularly difficult. Osteopontin (OPN) is a protein known to be
involved in tumor progression. The purpose of this study is to determine
expression of OPN in meningiomas and to investigate its correlation with WHO
grades and tumor recurrence. Immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of expression
of OPN was performed by two different methods to ensure reliability. OPN IHC and 
Allred scores were calculated on the basis of intensity and extent of staining.
Both scores were in agreement and correlated significantly with meningioma grade 
and Ki-67 index. OPN scores were also significantly correlated with recurrence of
WHO grade I meningiomas. Cut-off values for OPN IHC and OPN Allred scores between
non-recurrent and recurrent grade I meningiomas were calculated as 70 and 5.5
respectively. We concluded that OPN is a valuable marker for grading meningiomas 
and for predicting the recurrence in WHO grade I tumors.

The mechanisms responsible for the malignant transformation in Barrett's
esophagus (BE) are still poorly understood. The authors have evaluated the role
of Rho-kinase (ROCK1 and ROCK2) expressions in patients with BE. All patients
underwent upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy, which was confirmed
histologically. Real-time PCR revealed no marked change in gene expressions of
ROCK1 and ROCK2 at mRNA levels in BE when compared to controls.
Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed no change in ROCK1 and ROCK2
protein expressions in BE. This study demonstrates that Rho-kinase gene and
protein expressions are not modified in BE.

Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by Francisella tularensis. Tularemia outbreaks
occurred in Central Anatolia during 2009 and 2011. We evaluated the clinical
characteristics and cytomorphologies of fine needle aspirations (FNAs) from
cervical lymph nodes in serologically confirmed tularemia cases. To our
knowledge, this is the first large series concerning FNA morphology of Tularemia.
FNA smears of 53 patients of the 290, diagnosed by microagglutination tests and
PCR, were evaluated at three Pathology centers. FNAs were performed by
cytopathologists or ear-nose-throat surgeons. Of all patients, 17 had also lymph 
node resections. FNAs showed the presence of suppuration and abscess. Rare
epithelioid histiocytes and granulomas, seldom phagocytosed bacilli-like
microorganisms were observed. On histopathology; granulomas, necrosis, and
suppurative inflammation extending extracapsular areas were seen. Tularemia is
endemic in certain areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The benefit from
cytopathology is limited and cytological suspicion should be confirmed by
serology. However FNA cytology is helpful in differential diagnosis of tularemia 
and other diseases presented with suppurative, granulomatous cervical
lymphadenitis. It is also useful in providing the material for PCR and culture in
early phase when the serology is negative and the treatment is more effective.

In the 2008 WHO lymphoma classification, 'EBV-positive diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) of the elderly is included as a new provisional entity. We aimed
to evaluate the morphological, immunophenotypic, and clinical characteristics of 
the cases diagnosed as 'EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly' in our center and
compared them with the 'EBV-negative DLBCL' patients older than 50 years of age. 
EBV status was detected by Epstein-Barr early RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization
analysis. By immunohistochemistry, a panel of antibodies for CD10, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, 
IRF4/MUM1, CD30, and Ki67 was performed. Out of 149 DLBCL patients older than 50 
years, without any known history of immunodeficiency or prior lymphoma, eight
patients who fulfill the criteria were re-evaluated. Five patients were male and 
three were female, with a median age of 67.6 years. Four patients presented with 
nodal involvement; others presented with bone and soft tissue, bone marrow, and
spleen infiltrations. Five cases revealed predominantly monomorphic morphology,
one also contained focal areas consistent with polymorphous subtype; and three
patients revealed a polymorphous infiltrate. When classified according to 'Hans
criteria', five were non-GCB, and three were of the GCB cell phenotype. All cases
with polymorphous morphology were revealed to be of the non-GCB cell phenotype,
and all expressed IRF4/MUM1. Two patients died with disease, four patients are
alive and in complete remission following R-CHOP therapy, and two patients have
just recently been diagnosed. When compared with the EBV-negative group, there
are no reliable morphological and immunohistochemical features indicating EBV
positivity. Therefore, EBER in situ hybridization analysis is necessary to
identify 'EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly'. Further studies are needed to fully
understand the details of this disease, which can lead to new treatment
modalities.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of 
the gastrointestinal tract, and the majority contain KIT or PDGFRA-activating
mutations. However, up to 10% of GISTs are c-kit-negative. Antibodies with
increased sensitivity and specificity for the detection of c-kit-negative GIST
cases may be of value, especially because some of these cases may also benefit
from tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Hematoxylin and Eosin sections of 33
GISTs were re-examined in order to define histopathological criteria used in risk
assessment of these tumors. Immunohistochemistry with a panel of antibodies
[c-kit, DOG1 (discovered on GIST 1), CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), Desmin,
S100 and Ki67] was performed on 5μm-thick paraffin sections of all tumors.
Statistical analysis of immunohistochemical studies showed that DOG1 and CD117
were the most sensitive and specific antibodies in the diagnosis of GISTs. Other 
antibodies were unhelpful in confirming a diagnosis of GIST, but were
particularly useful in the differential diagnosis. Reactivity for DOG1 may aid in
the diagnosis of GISTs, which fail to express c-kit antigen, and lead to
appropriate treatment with imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the KIT tyrosine
kinase.

Beclin 1 plays a critical role in the regulation of autophagy, apoptosis,
differentiation, as well as in the development and progression of cancer. The aim
of this study was to examine the expression of beclin 1 and bcl-2 in bladder
urothelial tumors, and to investigate the relationship between these two markers 
and clinicopathological parameters. Our study included 84 bladder urothelial
tumors and 10 non-tumoral bladder tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 
tissue microarray (TMA) sections and was evaluated semiquantitatively on the
basis of the percentage of positively stained cells (proportion) and staining
intensity. A significant association was found between the expression score of
beclin 1 and pT stages of the urothelial tumors (p=0.012). Also, the level of
beclin 1 expression inversely correlated with histological grade and pT stages
(p=0.009, r=-0.284; p=0.001, r=-0.361, respectively). The bcl-2 expression level 
positively correlated with histological grade and pT stages of the urothelial
tumors (p=0.026, r=0.243; p<0.0001, r=0.491, respectively). In addition, the
level of beclin 1 expression tended to be inversely correlated with the bcl-2
expression level in urothelial tumors (p=0.055, r=-0.210). According to our data,
down-regulation of beclin 1 expression and also bcl-2 overexpression seem to play
an important role in the progression and aggressiveness of bladder urothelial
tumors.

Loss of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in the liver is associated with hepatic
steatosis and inflammation. We conducted a study in order to investigate the
presence and extent of ER-α expression in NASH, and its relationship with
histological findings. Fifty-four patients with histologically confirmed NASH, 12
patients with simple steatosis (SS), and 6 patients with normal liver tissue
(NLT) were included. NASH activity score and fibrosis score were calculated
according to biopsy findings. Liver biopsy specimens were immunohistochemically
stained for ER-α expression. Nuclear ER-α expression percentage (staining index) 
was calculated. Mean staining index was significantly different across the NASH, 
SS, and NLT groups (6.3±9.9 vs. 22.1±26.4 vs. 44.2±24.8, respectively, p<0.001
for all comparisons). Staining index was significantly higher in women than in
men (19.4±22.2 vs. 7.9±15.3, respectively, p=0.003). Staining index negatively
correlated with serum ALT (r=-0.240; p=0.04), fasting plasma glucose (r=-0.261;
p=0.027), and fibrosis score (r=-0.312; p=0.011). As a conclusion, hepatic
nuclear ER-α expression percentage (staining index) is lower in patients with
NASH when compared to SS and NLT groups. Staining index is negatively correlated 
with serum ALT levels, plasma glucose, and fibrosis score. Further studies are
required to clarify the significance of ER-α expression in NASH.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is defined as the involvement of 
brain, leptomeninges, eyes or spinal cord by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The role of
various prognostic markers in predicting adverse outcome is debated.OBJECTIVES:
To investigate the clinical and immunohistochemical findings of immunocompetent
PCNSL cases (39 cases) diagnosed at the study center, and evaluate the influence 
of potential prognostic factors on overall survival (OS) of patients.
METHODS: Data regarding patient characteristics, neuroimaging, pathological and
immunohistochemical features and follow-up were obtained from patient records.
The influence of potential prognostic parameters on OS was investigated by
log-rank test and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Patients who received combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy had a
significantly better OS when compared to chemotherapy alone. Other variables
included in this study were not associated with a significant survival advantage.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we failed to demonstrate a relationship between
different clinicopathological variables and OS of patients. Prospective studies
with large patient series are needed to investigate other potential prognostic
factors.

This study aimed to evaluate the rate of endocervical glandular involvement,
positive surgical margins, multicentricity, and disease extent between low-grade 
and high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions after loop electrosurgical
excision procedure (LEEP). Pathology medical records of patients who underwent
LEEP were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with negative LEEP results were
excluded. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure reports of patients with
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 2, and 3 were compared. There was no 
statistically significant difference between patients with CIN 1 (n=24), CIN 2
(n=27), and CIN 3 (n=64) when age and surgical margin positivity were considered.
Endocervical glandular involvement, multicentricity, and disease extent were
higher in patients with CIN 3 (P=.001, P=.002, and P=.001, respectively). In
conclusion, we recommend that patients with endocervical glandular involvement,
lesions involving more than two-thirds of the LEEP specimen, and multicentricity 
be followed up more closely.

There is no significant association between death receptor 4 (DR4) gene
polymorphisms and lung cancer in Turkish population.

Death receptor 4 (DR4) gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that has a role 
in apoptotic pathway. It was reported in literature that polymorphisms in DR4
gene lead to susceptibility to many cancers. In accordance with this information,
we aimed to investigate the association between G422A, C626G, A683C and A1322G
polymorphisms in DR4 gene and lung cancer. We selected 60 patients with lung
cancer (LC) and 30 healthy, sex and age matched volunteers randomly. Four
polymorhisms, G422A, C626G, A683C and A1322G, in DR4 gene were analyzed with
Polymerase Change Reaction (PCR)--Restriction Fragment Lenght Polymorphism (RFLP)
and Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) techniques in both groups.
Our results showed that there are no statistically significances between the
patients and controls in terms of the G422A, C626G, A683C and A1322G
polymorphisms in DR4 gene (p > 0,05). Our findings showed no role of DR4 gene
polymorphisms in susceptibility to LC and provide a plausible explanation for DR4
genetic heterogeneity in LC susceptibility.

Abstract The authors investigate the curative effects of crude exopolysaccharides
(EPS) produced by four Basidomycetes strains on the symptoms of alcoholic liver
injury. EPSs were administered to experimental groups at levels of 100 mg per kg 
body weight per day for 7 days using an oral zonde needle after the onset of the 
disease. Serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activities, and mitochondrial outer membrane
integrity were determined following sacrifice of the rats. Light and transmission
electron microscope (TEM) studies were performed on liver sections for
histopathological and cytological evaluations. EPS that was obtained from
Coprinus comatus OBCC 1014 decreased serum ALT level and increased outer membrane
integrity, and allowed for the regaining of histologically and cytologically
normal hepatocyte and tissue views. As a result, based on the obtained data, it
can be argued that among all studied mushroom strains crude exopolysaccharides
from Coprinus comatus OBCC 1014 strain have therapeutic potential for alcoholic
liver injury according to control groups.

We intended to reevaluate the morphologic prognostic factors for early-stage
ovarian carcinomas. We reviewed 111 patients diagnosed with early-stage ovarian
cancer who had undergone primary surgery at Hacettepe Hospital between 1984 and
2001, using diagnostic criteria from the WHO-2003 classification. We applied the 
Universal grading system suggested by Shimizu/Silverberg and noted FIGO-stage,
histotype, tumor size, bilaterality, and endometriosis. These features were
compared with each other and survival. The survival analysis was carried out by
Kaplan-Meier curves. Of the cases, 52 were reclassified as 'borderline tumor' or 
'cystadenoma with borderline foci' and 59 as 'invasive carcinoma'. FIGO-stage and
mitotic count were significant for survivals of 59 patients with cancer. Mitotic 
index was also significant for the probability of metastasis. The patients with
stage-II cancer had 5.65 times more risk of recurrence than stage-I cancer. The
5-year overall and disease-free survivals rates were 90.6% and 87.5% for stage-I,
54.7% and 39.3% for stage-II, respectively. Universal grade did not reach
statistical significance for survivals but it was related to FIGO-stage
significantly. In conclusion, FIGO-stage is the most reliable prognosticator.
Although prognostic value of universal grade is not significant, mitotic count
may provide important prognostic information for early-stage ovarian carcinomas.

Diseases Research Center (GEMHAM), Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.
Electronic address: denizyat@hotmail.com.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E on
homocysteine and cholesterol-induced damage of rat aorta.
METHODS: Wistar rats (all fed with a vitamin E poor diet) were divided into five 
groups. Control group was fed with the diet only, the second group received 1 mg 
kg(-1) day(-1) L-methionine in drinking water, the third group was fed with 2%
cholesterol containing diet, the fourth group received L-methionine and
cholesterol together, and the fifth group was fed with L-methionine and
cholesterol and received intramuscular injections of vitamin E. After 4 weeks
serum homocysteine, cholesterol and vitamin E levels were measured; aortas were
removed; collagen and elastin and the major extracellular matrix components were 
evaluated microscopically as indicators of aortic degeneration. Aortic collagen
content was measured by a colorimetric hydroxyproline assay.
RESULTS: Four-week diet supplementation with methionine and cholesterol caused a 
twofold increase in serum homocysteine and 22% increase in serum cholesterol
levels; endothelial damage and degenerative alterations in the aortic media were 
observed, as indicated by the dissociation of elastic fibers and accumulation of 
collagen. Vitamin E completely prevented the accumulation of collagen and largely
prevented aorta damage as shown by the morphological data.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that, even moderate increases in homocysteine
and cholesterol levels are sufficient to induce vascular degeneration that may be
prevented by vitamin E supplementation.

Pathology Clinic, Izmir, Turkey. asumanargon@gmail.com

OBJECTIVES: Since malignant cells were first detected in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), numerous methods have been used for CSF examination. The
cytocentrifugation and liquid-based cytology (LBC) methods are two of these. We
aimed to investigate whether the results from the LBC method were different from 
the results of the cytological diagnosis of the CSF materials that were prepared 
using the cytocentrifugation method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the
pathological records of 3,491 (cytocentrifugation on 1,306 and LBC on 2,185)
cytological specimens of CSF which were diagnosed over a 4-year period between
January 2007 and December 2011. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the
results of the LBC and cytocentrifugation methods.
RESULTS: While there was a noticeable decrease in nondiagnostic diagnosis and a
slight decrease in suspicious diagnosis, there was an increase in malignant and
benign diagnosis with the LBC method in comparison to the centrifugation method. 
Statistically, the decrease in nondiagnostic diagnosis was considered significant
(p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION: The LBC method seems like a better option than the cytocentrifugation
method, because of many preparatory, screening and diagnostic advantages,
especially in pathology departments where materials come from far away and large 
volumes are examined.

An uncontrolled use of "demonstration control agents" commonly known as "teargas 
agents" has recently been a common practice in Turkey. One of the first massive
uses of these agents had been during a meeting of the North Atlantic Council and 
NATO in 2004, in Istanbul. After the demonstrations, 64 patients were evaluated
and treated by the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey. Their files have been
reviewed retrospectively and were classified regarding age, sex, physical
findings related of chemical agents, and other injuries.The patients were
received 1 to 9 days after the chemical gas exposure. The maximum referral was 35
patients on the day of the gas exposure. The last application was 9 days after
the exposure. Complaints and physical findings/symptoms were highest during the
first 3 days.This study has been carried out to reveal the short- and long-term
aftereffects of "demonstration control agents." The safety and effects of these
agents are discussed in this article, based on our findings and existing
references.

paraffin blocks were histopathologically diagnosed at the Department of Pathology
of the Medical Hospital of Duzce University, between 2005 and 2011. The cases
consisted of 24 clear cell (CC) and 26 non-clear cell (NCC) RCC subtypes as
follows: 24 (48%) clear cell RCC, 12 (24%) papillary RCC, 4 (8%) multilocular
cystic RCC and 10 (20%) chromophobe RCC; none had sarcomatoid changes. By
immunohistochemical analysis we investigated AEG-1 and p53 expression in
carcinomas of the kidney, and by statistical analysis determined their
relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Significant relationships were 
found between increasing tumor diameter and the increase of p53 (p = 0.028). In
addition, p53 was significantly related to renal sinus invasion (p = 0.05) and
Fuhrman grade (p = 0.026). There was a significant relationship between increased
AEG-1 staining scores and CC and NCC carcinoma subtypes (p = 0.032), tumor
capsule invasion (p = 0.01) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.015). There was
also a significant correlation between tumor size and capsule and lymphovascular 
invasion (p = 0.02). We concluded that high AEG-1 and p53 expression correlates
with the prognostic parameters in RCC patients, and in addition may be associated
with tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: The schisis theory suggests that neural tube defect (NTD), cleft lip 
and palate (CL/P), omphalocele and diaphragmatic hernia are associated to each
other more frequently than at the expected random combination rates in a given
fetus. However, it is unusual to see schisis-associated defects concordantly in
dichorionic twin pregnancy with other schisis-associated and non-associated
defects. In addition, the association of lower limb oligodactly with oral cleft
and spina bifida has not been reported before.
CASE: A 24-year-old woman with twin gestation at 21 weeks was referred to our
unit. At ultrasound examination, bilateral CL/P and single umbilical artery in
male fetus, and bilateral CL/P and open lumbar spina bifida in female fetus were 
revealed. At autopsy, oligodactyly of both lower limbs was demonstrated in the
female fetus. The parents had no family history of NTD and CL/P. There was no
consanguinity, nor was the mother exposed to teratogens.

We aimed to demonstrate the potential protective effects of pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH). Adult male rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control
group, MCT-treated rats only, MCT-injected rats treated with PDTC, and
PDTC-treated rats only. Blood and tissue samples were collected after the
sacrifice. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by using the
thiobarbituric acid method. Total antioxidant status (TAS) was determined using a
commercially available ImAnOx kit. A histopathological evaluation was
accomplished by scoring the degree of severity. Endothelial damage of the main
pulmonary artery was evaluated by immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial
cells using anti-rat endothelial cell antigen 1 (RECA-1) antibody. MCT-induced
right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was reduced significantly in the
MCT+PDTC-treated group. MDA levels were significantly lowered in the
MCT+PDTC-treated group. TAS was significantly higher in the MCT+PDTC-treated
group when compared with the rats with PAH. Histopathological examination
demonstrated that PDTC treatment reduced the development of inflammation,
hemorrhage and congestion, and collagen deposition. In conclusion, PDTC
attenuated PAH and protected pulmonary endothelium in rats administered MCT.
These findings suggest that PDTC treatment may provide a new effective
therapeutic approach in the treatment of PAH.

Faculty, Samsun, Turkey.

The present study examined the effect of DS exposure on median nerve development 
in rats during prenatal life. Pregnant female rats were divided into three
groups: a control group, a saline group and a DS group. Offspring of these
animals were divided into 2 subgroups: 4 weeks old and 20 weeks old. Nerve
samples were taken from the right legs and evaluated using stereological
techniques in terms of the axon number, axon cross-sectional area, and myelin
thickness. No drug-dependent macroscopic abnormality was observed in the nerve.
No differences were noted for axon number in the control, saline, and DS groups
of the same age and gender. No gender difference was found for axon number or
axon area between the other matched groups. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to
diclofenac sodium does not affect axon number in rats, but can alter the
morphology of the male and female median nerve.

This study is designed to evaluate the roles of oxidative and nitrosative stress 
in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS) patients. Oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS), 8-epi-PGF2α, conjugated diene and nitrosative stress markers
nitrotyrosine, nitrit-nitrate were analysed in serum and CSF of 20 newly
diagnosed RRMS patients before and after methyl prednysolone (MP) therapy (1000
mg/day i.v., for 5 days) and in healthy control group.TBARS and conjugated diene 
were analysed spectrophotometrically, nitrite-nitrate fluorometrically,
8-epi-PGF2α and nitrotyrosine were measured by ELISA. Serum conjugated diene (p <
0.001) and 8-epi-PGF2α (p < 0.05) levels were significantly higher in RRMS
patients before MP therapy with respect to control group. MP therapy caused a
significant decrease only in 8-epi-PGF2α level (p < 0.05). Serum nitrotyrosine
levels were significantly lower in RRMS patients both before (p < 0.001) and
after (p < 0.001) MP therapy with respect to controls. Serum nitrite-nitrate
levels were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in RRMS patients before therapy
compared to controls. Nitrotyrosine and nitrite-nitrate levels in CSF of RRMS
patients were significantly higher (p < 0.001) before therapy compared to normal 
pressure hydrocephalia control group. Our findings reveal increased oxidative
stress in serum of RRMS patients and the benefical role of MP therapy in
relieving oxidative stress.As to nitrosative stress, nitrotyrosine and
nitrite-nitrate levels were increased in CSF and decreased in serum.

Pseudopapillary pattern in intra-operative squash smear preparations of central
nervous system germinomas.

Ates D(1), Kosemehmetoglu K, Onder S, Soylemezoglu F.

Author information:

Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Although the morphology of central nervous system (CNS) germ cell
tumours is very similar to that of gonadal germ cell tumours, some architectural 
changes may dominate the microscopic appearance of CNS germinomas leading to
misdiagnosis at low-power magnification.
METHODS: We report five cases of CNS germinoma demonstrating delicate
pseudopapillary fronds on squash smear preparations.
RESULTS: The age of the patients ranged from 5 to 21 years (mean 14). Three were 
female and two male. Three patients presented with symptoms of diabetes
insipidus, including polydipsia and polyuria, while absence seizures, meaningless
speech, hemiparesia, weight loss, insufficient breast development, amenorrhoea
and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure were also encountered depending on
the location of the tumours. Tumours were located in the hypophysis in two cases 
and in the suprasellar region in three. During the intra-operative pathological
consultation, evenly distributed pseudopapillary or papillary structures formed
the dominant pattern in the squash preparations of all cases. The neoplastic
cells were characterized by pale variably vacuolated cytoplasm, pleomorphic
nuclei with irregular membranes, and several prominent nucleoli. Variable numbers
of small lymphocytes were also found.
CONCLUSION: Intracranial germinomas may commonly exhibit a pseudopapillary
pattern on squash smears that may cause misdiagnosis as neoplasms with papillary 
morphology. Careful examination of cellular details is essential in order to
reach the correct diagnosis.

Recently, Coppola and colleagues demonstrated that a rare microtubule-associated 
protein tau (MAPT) sequence variant, c.454G>A (p.A152T) significantly increases
the risk of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorders and Alzheimer
disease (AD) in a screen of 15,369 subjects. We describe clinical features of 9
patients with neurodegenerative disease (4 women) harboring p.A152T, aged 51 to
79 years at symptom onset. Seven developed FTD spectrum clinical syndromes,
including progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (n=2), behavioral variant FTD
(bvFTD, n=1), nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA, n=2), and
corticobasal syndrome (n=2); 2 patients were diagnosed with clinical AD. Thus,
MAPT p.A152T is associated with a variety of FTD spectrum clinical presentations,
although patients with clinical AD are also identified. These data warrant larger
studies with clinicopathologic correlation to elucidate the influence of this
genetic variant on neurodegenerative disease.

Is there a role for on-site evaluation of thyroid fine needle aspiration to
reduce the nondiagnostic rate?

The use of immediate on-site evaluation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)
specimens can determine the adequacy of specimens and provides a specific
preliminary diagnosis. In this prospective study, we evaluated the impact of
on-site assessment of thyroid FNAB performed under ultrasound guidance. Totally, 
204 (170 female, 34 male) patients (102 on site, 102 control group) were
included. The patients were randomized on site and regular cytologic examination 
groups. Quick May-Grünwald Giemsa stain was used for on-site examination and FNA 
was continued until adequate aspirate for optimal cytological examination. Two
(2.0 %) of the 102 patients evaluated with on-site examination had a
nondiagnostic result. However, 16 (15.7 %) of the 102 patients examined by
regular cytologic examination method, had nondiagnostic result. The difference
between these two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The major
cause of a nondiagnostic thyroid FNAB specimen is the failure to aspirate a
sufficient number of cells necessary for diagnosis cystic lesions. Immediate
on-site evaluation can significantly decrease the nondiagnostic rate of thyroid
FNAB specimens.

University, Istanbul, Turkey.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in hot and cold water
distribution systems. With molecular typing methods it was shown that water can
be the source of colonization and infection with NTM. The aim of our study was
the investigation of NTM in hot and cold water samples taken from various
departments of two hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey. Totally, 160 water samples were
examined. The temperature, pH, and free chlorine levels of water samples were
measured between 10-41 °C, 6.78-7.98 and <0.3-0.5 mg/L, respectively. NTM were
detected in 33 (20.6%) samples. Totally 20 (60.6%), 10 (30.3%) and 3 (9.1%)
isolates were identified as Mycobacterium lentiflavum, Mycobacterium gordonae,
and Mycobacterium peregrinum, respectively. M. lentiflavum, which was the most
frequently isolated NTM, is characterized by multiple resistance to
antimycobacterial drugs. Although no infections with this mycobacterium were
reported from our country so far, preventive measures may be considered in
patients under immunosuppression. Because no significant correlations were found 
among the presence of NTM or species distribution and water temperature, pH or
free chlorine levels, other factors need to be investigated.

Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. Electronic address: ncolak44@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of reduced glutathione, has been 
in clinical use primarily as a mucolytic. In addition, NAC is well known for
their free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. Increasing of reactive 
oxygen products occurring during cardiac surgery can play an important role in
postoperative adhesion formation. We investigated to the efficacy of the NAC for 
postoperative pericardial adhesions.
METHODS: Sixteen New Zealand white rabbits (2.5-3 kg) were used and categorized
into two groups including study (use of NAC) and control groups. In both groups, 
the pericardium was opened longitudinally, and the exposed epicardial surfaces
were abraded with dry gauze. The rabbits were divided into two groups: Group 1
was treated with the sponge, which impregnated with NAC solution, (10%, 300 mg/3 
ml) and applied over the abraded epicardium for 5 min (n=8). Group 2 was the
control, and the sponge, which was impregnated with 3-ml isotonic NaCl solution
(0.9%), was applied onto the surface of the abraded epicardium for 5 min (n=8).
After a period of 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. The scores of adhesion
were graded by macroscopic examination, and the pericardial tissues were analyzed
microscopically in point of inflammation and fibrosis.
RESULTS: In Group 1, the adhesion scores were significantly lower compared with
the control group [Group 1 vs. 2; 1 (1-2) vs. 3 (2-3), P<.001]. No significant
difference was found between the groups in terms of the severity of inflammation 
[Group 1 vs. 2; 1.5 (1-3) vs. 2.5 (1-3), P=.083]. There was a difference between 
groups in terms of the degree of fibrosis [Group 1 vs. 2; 2 (1-2) vs. 3 (2-3),
P=.007].
CONCLUSIONS: The use of NAC for preventing postoperative pericardial adhesions
was reduced to adhesion and fibrosis scores in an experimental rabbit model.
There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of
inflammatory scores. The NAC effectively prevented the formation of pericardial
adhesion.

Although the basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy of skin, it
is rarely seen in vulva and constitutes 2% to 4% of all vulvar cancers. The cause
is unknown but, chronic vulvar irritation is the most important underlying
factor. The patients over 60 years are affected more frequently than younger
ones.

Invasive papillary carcinoma is a rare variant of breast cancer. We report an
unusual case of invasive papillary carcinoma of the breast with high nuclear
grade, brisk mitosis, necrosis, extensive apocrine differentiation, and intense
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate; additionally triple-negativity for estrogen and
progesterone receptors and Her2 neu. The patient underwent modified radical
mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. But, it was a node negative breast
carcinoma. Increasing the awareness of this clinicopathologic entity would be
helpful in avoiding overtreatment of patients with this cancer even if the tumor 
has negative morphological and immunohistochemical prognosticators.

Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to establish the distribution of
thyroid lesions that were seen in Hatay (a province of southern Turkey), to
review the accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of
thyroid nodules and to correlate the FNAC results with the histopathology of the 
excised specimens, especially in indeterminate cases.
METHODS: Data on patient cytology were retrieved by a retrospective search of all
thyroid FNAC specimens that had been evaluated at the Department of Pathology,
Antakya Public Hospital, Hatay, Turkey between January 2009 and February 2011;
1021 thyroid FNAC samples were reviewed and interpretations were recorded
according to the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology (TBSRTC).
The results of adequate FNAC samples were compared with the histological
diagnoses in the cases in which surgery was performed, and the malignancy rates, 
especially in indeterminate categories, were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 1021 FNAC samples, 697 (68.3%) were benign, 122 (11.9%) were
non-diagnostic, 100 (9.8%) were atypia of undetermined significance/follicular
lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), 41 (4%) were follicular
neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN), 36 (3.5%) were suspicious
for malignancy (SM) and 25 (2.4%) were malignant. In 219 cases, there was
follow-up histology. Rates of malignancy were as follows: benign, 0%; AUS/FLUS,
12.7%; FN/SFN, 35.0%; SM, 91.4%; malignant, 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the cytohistological correlation of benign and
malignant lesions was 100%. In the indeterminate categories, we recommend that
clinicians should evaluate both the clinical and radiological findings of
patients in addition to the FNAC results.

A case of neonatal cholestasis associated with Trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome) is 
presented. A 3-day-old boy was referred to our clinic due to respiratory
distress, elevated serum direct bilirubin levels, a systolic heart murmur, growth
restriction and micrognathia. Liver biopsy and chromosomal analysis revealed
paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts and Trisomy 18. Extrahepatic biliary atresia
was reported in only a few patients with Trisomy 18. To our knowledge, we
described for the first time a patient with Trisomy 18 and neonatal cholestasis
associated with paucity of interlobular bile ducts.

Liver tumors seldom occur in the perinatal period. Hepatic hemangiomas are the
most common tumors of the liver diagnosed during fetal and neonatal life. The
diagnosis can be suspected antenatally by ultrasound and MR scan. The
differential diagnosis is often challenging. While small hepatic hemangiomas are 
usually asymptomatic, large tumors can lead to complications such as high-output 
congestive heart failure, consumptive thrombocytopenic coagulopathy and
hemorrhage after tumor rupture. We describe a case of hepatic hemangioma
presenting as a solid abdominal mass with several cystic areas on an obstetric
ultrasound and report on the contribition fetal MR imaging to the diagnosis.

AIM: To assess and compare the roles of plasma and urine concentrations of
neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) and Cystatin C for early
diagnosis of septic acute kidney injury (AKI) in adult critically ill patients.
METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups as sepsis-non AKI, sepsis-AKI
and non sepsis-non AKI. Plasma samples for NGAL and Cystatin C were determined on
admission and on alternate days and urinary samples were collected for every day 
until ICU discharge.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty one patients were studied; 66 in sepsis-non AKI, 63 in
sepsis-AKI, 22 in non-sepsis-non-AKI groups. Although plasma NGAL performed less 
well (AUC 0.44), urinary NGAL showed significant discrimination for AKI diagnosis
(AUC 0.80) with a threshold value of 29.5 ng/ml (88% sensitivity, 73%
specificity). Both plasma and urine Cystatin C worked well for the diagnosis of
AKI (AUC 0.82 and 0.86, thresholds 1.5 and 0.106 mg/L respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasma and urinary Cystatin C and urinary NGAL are useful markers in 
predicting AKI in septic critically ill patients. Plasma NGAL raises in patients 
with sepsis in the absence of AKI and should be used with caution as a marker of 
AKI in septic ICU patients.

We compared the diagnostic performances of conventional smears and cell block
preparations of tissue samples obtained with endobronchial ultrasound-guided
transbronchial needle aspiration. We retrospectively analysed 451 patients (926
lymph nodes) who had undergone endobronchial ultrasound and for whom both smears 
and cell blocks were available and compared the diagnostic performances of these 
techniques when used alone and combined. Cell block preparations showed higher
diagnostic performance over smears, but the combination was superior to either
alone. The combination of smear and cell block techniques achieved a sensitivity,
specificity and positive and negative predictive values of 92.5, 100, 100, 97.7
and 99.4, 95.0, 98.6, and 97.9 % for malignant and benign diseases, respectively.
We recommend cell block preparations during endobronchial ultrasound-guided
transbronchial needle aspiration.

ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases family plays an important role in cell cycle
regulation. Overexpression of ErbB receptors has been described in several solid 
tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of ErbB1, ErbB2,
ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression in bladder cancer. Urinary bladder tumor samples were
obtained from 33 bladder cancers and 7 non-cancerous bladder biopsies. The levels
of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 genes expression in bladder cancer were
determined by real-time PCR. The presence of protein was confirmed by
immunostaining. Expression of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 genes increased
0.67, 4.72, 2.89, and 2.65-fold, respectively, in bladder tumors as compared with
normal tissue. There was a significant difference between immunostaining results 
of ErbB4 protein in bladder tumors and normal bladder tissue (P<0.01). The
present data suggest that ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 genes may have a role in
bladder cancer tumorigenesis.

This study was designed to investigate the possible protective effect of lycopene
against the renal toxic effects of OTA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (<200 g, n=6)
were treated with OTA (0.5 mg/kg/day) and/or lycopene (5 mg/kg/day) by gavage for
14 days. Histopathological examinations were performed and apoptotic cell death
in both cortex and medulla was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Besides, biochemical
parameters and activities of renal antioxidant selenoenzymes [glutathione
peroxidase 1 (GPx1), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)], catalase (CAT), superoxide
dismutase (SOD); concentrations of total glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde
(MDA) levels were measured. OTA treatment was found to induce oxidative stress in
rat kidney, as evidenced by marked decreases in CAT (35%) activity and GSH levels
(44%) as well as increase in SOD activity (22%) vs control group. Furthermore,
TUNEL analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive
cells in cortex (49%) and medulla (75%) in OTA administrated group compared to
control (p<0.05). Lycopene supplementation with OTA increased GPx1 activity and
GSH levels, and decreased apoptotic cell death in both cortex and medulla vs.
control. The results of this study showed that at least one of the mechanisms
underlying the renal toxicity of OTA is oxidative stress and apoptosis is the
major form of cell death caused by OTA. Besides, our data indicate that the
natural antioxidant lycopene might be partially protective against OTA-induced
nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress in rat.

Diagnostic and prognostic significance of image cytometric DNA ploidy measurement
in cytological samples of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions.

Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. demireldilaver@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: To study the DNA ploidy pattern of uterine cervical squamous
intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and its diagnostic and prognostic significance.
METHODS: The study included 31 cases of SIL: 11 low-grade (LSIL) and 20
high-grade (HSIL). Feulgen-pararosaniline staining was performed on previously
Papanicolaou-stained smears and a DNA image cytometric study was performed. An
internal reference was used to calibrate the samples.
RESULTS: All 31 cases of SIL, either LSIL or HSIL, were non-diploid. Of the 11
cases of LSIL, four were tetraploid and seven were aneuploid, whereas, of the 20 
cases of HSIL, four were tetraploid and 16 were aneuploid. Stemline aneuploidy
was not a significant discriminator between LSIL and HSIL (P=0.32). Based on
single-cell analysis, HSIL cases had significantly higher DNA content than LSIL
cases (P<0.01). When a mean of 30% or more was used for the 6c-exceeding event
(6cEE) value, the sensitivity and specificity to indicate HSIL were 83% and 64%, 
respectively, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81% and negative
predictive value (NPV) of 65%. All HSIL cases were cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) on biopsy. In addition, cases which showed
recurrence had more DNA content by single-cell analysis than those with an
indolent clinical behaviour: P=0.04 and P=0.03 for LSIL and HSIL, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Image cytometric DNA analysis is a useful technique for diagnostic
and prognostic purposes in uterine cervical SIL when appropriate 'c' values are
used in single-cell analysis. We propose that a >6c DNA content of 30% is useful 
as a cut-off level for predicting cases with CIN2+ in DNA image cytometry of
cervical smears.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association
between Rho-kinase (ROCK1 and ROCK2) gene polymorphisms and colorectal cancer
(CRC) development.
METHODS: Eighty-five patients operated due to CRC and 178 healthy controls with
similar age and sex were included to this study. Genomic DNA from the patients
and the healthy control cases was analyzed by a BioMark 96.96 dynamic array
system. The protein expressions of ROCK1, ROCK2 and p53 were determined by
immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: There were significant associations between ROCK1 (rs73963110 and
rs35996865) and ROCK2 gene polymorphisms (rs2290156, rs10178332, rs35768389,
rs10929732 and rs34945852) with CRC development. However, no marked associations 
were found between ROCK2 gene rs965665, rs2230774, rs6755196 and rs1515219
polymorphisms and the risk of developing CRC. Rho-kinase and p53
immunohistochemical stainings were markedly elevated in the tumor tissue. There
were significant correlations between vascular and perineural invasions with
ROCK2 or p53 protein expressions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to demonstrate the contribution of
Rho-kinase in CRC development in patients. Our data showed that the ROCK1 and
ROCK2 genes might be a risk factor for CRC development and that genetic
polymorphisms in these genes may modify individual susceptibility to CRC in the
Turkish population.

Ultrastructural evaluation of the effect of N-acetylcysteine on methotrexate
nephrotoxicity in rats.

The aim of this study is to investigate the possible protective effect of
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) against the likely methotrexate (MTX) toxicity on the
kidney using ultrastructural together with biochemical data. Moreover, the
immunohistochemical detection of Ki67 nuclear antigen is to be evaluated. Fifteen
male Wistar albino rats, weighing 240-290 g, were divided into three equal
groups: Rats receiving MTX alone, rats receiving MTX plus NAC treatment, and rats
comprising the control group. MTX (18 mg/kg/day, body weight) in dissolved
physiologic saline was administered intraperitoneally to rats during 3 days. For 
the MTX plus NAC group, N-Acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg/day, body weight) was
administered together with MTX. At the end of the third day, all the rats were
killed with cervical dislocation to obtain blood and tissue samples. Application 
of MTX principally induced prominent large vacuolization in the proximal
convoluted tubule cells, and focal thickening in the glomerular basal lamina of
some glomeruli. A decrease in tissue SOD (superoxide dismutase) and GSH-Px
(glutathione peroxidase), and an increase in serum urea nitrogen and creatinine
and in tissue MDA (malondialdehyde) levels were also seen in the MTX group. These
changes were significantly reversed in the MTX-plus-NAC-treated group. Most of
the vacuoles in the proximal convoluted tubule cells disappeared. Furthermore, an
increase in antioxidant enzyme activities, a decrease in serum urea nitrogen and 
creatinine, and tissue MDA levels were all significant. Additionally, an increase
in the number of Ki67 positive-stained cells in proximal tubules was also noted. 
In conclusion, NAC may be a promising substance against MTX-induced renal damage.
It might be useful to use NAC supplementally to minimize MTX-induced
nephrotoxicity.

The coincidence of trisomy 21 and a structural rearrangement is very rare, and
even it has not been reported as a prenatal diagnosis yet. In this article, we
present an autosomal translocation carrier fetus with trisomy 21: 47,XX,+21,
t(3;8)(p21;q24). Although the coincidence of reciprocal translocation and trisomy
may be seen in reciprocal translocation carrier families, de novo cases are
extremely rare. The presented case is diagnosed by amniocentesis, which was
performed because of abnormal fetal ultrasonographic findings and increased
trisomy 21 risk at maternal serum screening test. The postmortem pathologic
examination of the fetus revealed that the findings of hypertelorism and right
lung with two lobes are interesting novel findings of our cases associated with
the breakpoints 3p21 and 8q24.

The aim of this study was the investigation of effects of the metenolone
enanthate (ME) that is used among athletes as doping and muscle amplifier, on
hearts of male and female rats that are in puberty using morphometrical methods. 
A total of 36 rats which were divided into three separate groups (Experiment, ME;
vehicle, PO; control, C) each consisting of 6 male and 6 female rats were used.
0.5 mg/kg metenolone enanthate was applied intraperitoneally into experiment
subjects 5 times a week over a period of 4 weeks. At the end of experiment, rats 
were euthanized and their hearts were cut at the level of musculus papillaris
after the fixation in formalin. Hearts were taken out and embedded in paraffin
wax. Photos were taken at cut surfaces, and thickness, diameters and surface area
levels were measured. Left ventriculus mass (LVM) and left ventriculus mass index
(LVMI) were calculated. In the study LVM (p<0.005) and LVMI (p<0.05) were found
to be significantly higher in the ME group in females whereas left ventricular
lumen diameter (LVLD) were found to be significantly lower (p<0.05). Thus left
ventricular hypertrophy development was observed. LVM and LVMI were found to be
similar in ME and C groups among male rats and the highest level of these data
were found in the group. LVM and LVMI were higher among females (p<0.006). In
conclusion, it has been shown that the adverse effects of ME on heart were
developing starting from puberty and resulting with the enlargement of the heart 
and left ventricular hypertrophy and especially among females this condition was 
more evident. It has also been discussed that the continuous use of drugs may
further enhance this condition.

The prognostic value of the type and extent of extracapillary proliferation (ECP)
in pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephitis (PIGN) was evaluated in 
this study. In 141 PIGN cases, all glomeruli with ECP were grouped according to
type (cellular, fibrocellular and fibrous) and extent of the lesions in Bowman's 
space; (segmental, semicircumferential and circumferential, which might be termed
full moon-FM). Cases with cellular and fibrous lesions involving ≥ 50% of
glomeruli with ECP were classified as cellular and fibrous groups, respectively, 
while the remaining cases were classified as fibrocellular. Cases with segmental 
and circumferential (FM glomerulus) lesions involving ≥ 50% of glomeruli with ECP
were classified as ECPI and ECPIII (FM) groups, respectively, while the rest were
classified as ECPII. All the cases were classified according to Berden et al.
Significant results were only nearly obtained for the FM group, including the
need for dialysis. The Cox regression model revealed a 2.6-fold risk for FM cases
regarding dialysis requirement. We propose that the percentage of FM glomeruli
should be noted in the pathology report, and cases with more than 50% of FM
glomeruli (FM group) should be identified in the group with increased risk of
dialysis requirement. Our series also suggests that classification according to
Berden et al. is of clinical relevance.

Three thousand and forty-one cases of thyroid FNAs have been classified following
the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology. They have been collected
over a two-year period in two different university centers; one in Turkey and the
other in France. Harmonization in the distribution of the diagnostic categories
as well as an increasing risk of malignancy towards "benign" to "malignant"
categories were shown in both of the series and were quite equivalent to the
Bethesda system expected results. Furthermore, applying this terminology gives us
the opportunity to make an easy comparison between our results. However, some
discrepancies still exist between these two compared series for the estimated
risk of malignancy per category. One reason could be the differences in
application of the cytological criteria. However, close analysis of our results
and comparison with already published series, lead us to point out that
differences between countries and institutions could also be due to factors other
than the Bethesda terminology such as epidemiological factors, organized national
screening and interobserver variability in histopathology.

Mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma: cytohistopathologic findings
and differential diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 80% of all 
the primary malignant tumors of the liver. Hepatoblastoma (HBL) is the most
common primary malignant neoplasm of the liver in childhood, and extremely rare
in adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an adult
case with cytopathologic description of a combined HCC and HBL, occurring in a
noncirrhotic liver.
CASE: A 24-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with right-sided abdominal 
pain. Masses in the liver were detected radiologically. Fine-needle aspiration
biopsy and core-needle biopsy revealed a malignant hepatocellular tumor with
features of both HCC and HBL.
CONCLUSION: In the present case among the distinct HCC cell groups, areas of
smaller and more primitive cells consistent with embryonal type HBL and some
other groups of cells with intermediate morphology were observed. These findings 
suggested the probable single stem cell origin of the tumor with differentiation 
to both cell groups rather than a combination of two different tumors. Therefore,
the term 'malignant hepatocellular tumor' could also be considered to define this
particular tumor. This case provides support to the previous reports in which HBL
areas are described in HCC.

Ovarian serous borderline tumor detected by conventional papanicolaou smear: a
case report.

(1)Department of Pathology, Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara,
Turkey. merihdemirel@yahoo.com.tr

BACKGROUND: Although the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear was originally designed to
detect premalignant cervical lesions and cancer, it has become apparent that
malignant cells from extrauterine primaries may also appear in the smears. Here, 
we report a case of a serous borderline tumor (SBT) of the ovary that was
detected by a conventional Pap smear.
CASE REPORT: In a 34-year-old woman, who was operated on for a left borderline
ovarian tumor 2 years ago, glandular dysplasia was discovered in a Pap smear
screening. The Pap smear showed a large number of atypical glandular cells
forming 3-dimensional papillary clusters. The cell clusters were enlarged and had
variably sized round or oval nuclei. The background was clean, and this finding
pointed to the noncervical origin of the malignant cells. A right ovarian cystic 
mass was discovered and a laparotomy performed. A histologic examination of the
ovarian mass revealed a SBT of the ovary.
CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the value of the Pap smear in discovering
unsuspected extrauterine malignancies, including SBTs of the ovary.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated
transcription factors belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.
Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARs regulate lipid metabolism and are
expressed in various cancers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
expression of PPAR-α, -β and -γ in normal canine testicular tissue and canine
testicular tumours (CTTs). Expression of PPAR-α, -β and -γ was greater (P <0.05) 
than in normal testicular tissue. PPARs were therefore induced in CTTs and they
may play a role in the biology of these tumours.

Primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenomas (PRMCs) are extremely rare tumors
and their association with sarcoma-like mural nodules (SLMNs) has not been
described thoroughly. The aim of this study is to characterize the gross and
microscopic features and the immunohistochemical profile of the first case of
PRMC with SLMN and to discuss the differential diagnosis of SLMNs. The literature
related to primary retroperitoneal mucinous tumors is reviewed in an attempt to
clarify the histogenesis of the epithelial and sarcomatoid components of the
associated mural nodules. A 34-yr-old woman presented with a 14-cm
retroperitoneal cystic lesion with a 6-cm mural nodule. An immunohistochemical
study with a panel of 19 antibodies and a histochemical study for mucin stains
were performed. The epithelial component of the PRMC showed positive staining for
cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK AE1/3, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic
antigen, and calretinin. The neoplasm was not immunoreactive for CK 20, CK 5/6,
and the other antibodies used in this study. In addition, it stained positively
for mucin by mucicarmine, periodic acid-Schiff, and Alcian blue. The stromal
cells of the cyst showed estrogen receptor positivity. SLMN cells were negative
for all CKs and other epithelial markers used in the study, but they showed
diffuse positive staining for vimentin and CD68, and positive staining for Ki-67 
was demonstrated in 25% of these cells. The immunohistochemical and histochemical
profiles of PRMC were similar to those of ovarian mucinous neoplasms and the
mesothelium. The formation of SLMNs seems to be related to subepithelial
hemorrhage and some reactive epithelial changes near the mural nodules. The
specific immunohistochemical and morphologic features of SLMNs are helpful in
differentiating them from malignant mural nodules, including true sarcomas,
osteoclast-rich undifferentiated carcinomas, and carcinosarcomas. Such a
differentiation is critical in view of its significant impact on the management
of these neoplasms, particularly in young patients who desire to preserve their
fertility.

In hepatic amyloidosis (HA), the relationships between the pattern and extent of 
amyloid deposition, morphologic changes, associated diseases and clinical data
have not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we sought the correlation between 
the above mentioned parameters in HA. Liver biopsies of 34 HA were
retrospectively analyzed for the type, distribution, and intensity of amyloid
deposition and associated morphologic changes. AA and nonAA types were classified
on the basis of immunohistochemistry. Follow-up clinical and laboratory findings 
were reviewed. Twenty-three out of 34 patients (67.6%) had AA, and 11 out of 34
patients (32.4%) had nonAA amyloidosis. The predominant localization pattern in
AA amyloidosis was vascular (91.3%), and in nonAA amyloidosis it was mixed with
other patterns (72.7%). We confirmed that nonAA amyloid involves the hepatic
artery, as well as the portal and central vein, but deposition occurred more
frequently in the sinusoidal areas. We detected a portal stromal pattern only in 
cases of nonAA amyloidosis with a mixed pattern of amyloid deposition. The
pattern of amyloid deposition in liver differs between the AA and nonAA type
amyloidosis. The distribution of amyloid within the liver is not a reliable
method for distinguishing AA from nonAA amyloidosis. However, the histological
pattern provides strong clues as to the etiology of the amyloid deposits, and
could provide information on the clinical status and prognosis of these patients.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small-vessel vasculitis of autoimmune
hypersensitivity, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates vascular
homeostasis and inflammation with activation of cytokine release. Thus, we aimed 
to investigate the association between HSP and ACE I/D and AGT M235T
polymorphisms. Genotyping was determined by allele specific PCR and PCR-RFLP. We 
obtained a significant difference in genotype distribution (p=0.003) and allele
frequencies (p<0.001) of ACE I/D polymorphism between patients and controls,
while no significant association was detected in genotype distribution (p> 0.05) 
and allele frequencies (p> 0.05) of the AGT M235T polymorphism. Risk assessment
showed significant risk for HSP in the subjects both with the ID + DD genotype
(p=0.019, OR: 2.288, 95% CI: 1.136-4.609) and D allele (OR: D vs. I: 2.0528, 95% 
CI: 1.3632-3.0912, p=0.001) while no significant risk was obtained for HSP in the
subjects both with the MT + TT genotype (p=0.312, OR: 1.3905, 95% T vs. M: 1.065,
95% CI: 0.7326-2.6391) and T allele (OR: patients were stratified by the presence
of certain systemic complications of HSP, no significant association was detected
with ACE I/D, and AGT M235T polymorphisms. Our findings suggest that ACE I/D
polymorphism is significantly associated with HSP susceptibility.

Spectrum of nontumoral renal pathologies in tumor nephrectomies: nontumoral renal
parenchyma changes.

Non-neoplastic changes are not rarely seen in renal parenchyma of nephrectomy
specimens removed for primary renal neoplasms. These changes often involve both
kidneys, thus causing impairment of renal function, reducing patient's quality of
life and sometimes threatening it. Renal tissue accompanying the tumor provides
an opportunity in order to evaluate these changes. However, the clinician should 
make available clinical and laboratory findings involving renal functions of the 
patient to the pathologist. It is also important that the pathologist must have
appropriate knowledge and experience in nephropathology. In this study, we aimed 
to correlate these changes with the clinical data and make inquiries regarding
our experience with nonneoplastic kidney pathology. Consecutive 403 nephrectomy
specimens with primary renal neoplasms submitted to our department between 2003
and 2009 were re-examined. Twenty-three nephrectomy materials from 21 patients
had non-neoplastic changes, 2 of which were bilateral. Patient follow-up data
were obtained from electronic medical records. Of all cases, eight had diabetic
nephropathy; 2, amyloidosis; 5, segmental proliferative and/or sclerotic
glomerulonephritis; and 6, cystic renal changes. These findings were seen in 5%
of nephrectomy specimens diagnosed as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
chromophobe cell RCC and oncocytoma, whereas this rate was two times higher in
nephrectomy specimens with papillary RCC. Most patients with renal failure who
were diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma died within the first two years. Despite
limited number of cases in our series, prognosis of cases with clear cell RCC
were poorer. Consequently, we think that non-neoplastic changes should be
reported along with the details regarding the tumor in order to achieve best
treatment planning.

In utero irradiation (IR) and postnatal hyperthermia (HT) exposure cause
infertility by decreasing spermatogenic colony growth and the number of sperm in 
rats. Four groups were used: (i) Control group, (ii) HT group (rats exposed to
hyperthermia on the 10th postnatal day), (iii) IR group (rats exposed to IR on
the 17th gestational day) and (iv) IR + HT group. Three and six months after the 
procedures testes were examined by light and electron microscopy. Some
degenerated tubules in the HT group, many vacuoles in spermatogenic cells and
degenerated tight junctions in the IR group, atrophic tubules and severe
degeneration of tight junctions in the IR + HT group were observed. ZO-1 and
occludin immunoreactivity were decreased and disorganized in the HT and IR groups
and absent in the IR + HT group. The increase in the number of apoptotic cells
was accompanied by a time-dependent decrease in haploid, diploid and tetraploid
cells in all groups. Degenerative findings were severe after 6 months in all
groups. The double-hit model may represent a Sertoli cell only model of
infertility due to a decrease in spermatogenic cell and alterated blood-testis
barrier proteins in rat.

Parathyromatosis, in which several nodules of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue
form in the neck and mediastinum, is a rare cause of recurrent
hyperparathyroidism. However, there are some theories regarding the origin of
parathyromatosis, and seeding after rupture of the parathyroid gland capsule
during surgical removal of a parathyroid lesions is the most regarded one.
Herein, we report a 41-year-old man who presented with multiple parathyroid
nodules in and around the left thyroid lobe 5 years after parathyroid surgery for
secondary hyperparathyroidism that was finally diagnosed as parathyromatosis. We 
discuss the differential diagnosis of parathyromatosis from other parathyroid
tumors, particularly from parathyroid carcinoma, which is important in the
management of a suspected lesion.

CONTEXT: There are virtually no data in the literature regarding the incidence,
patterns, and clinicopathologic characteristics of mucinous carcinomas (MCs) of
the gallbladder (GB).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of mucinous differentiation in invasive GB 
carcinomas and the clinicopathologic characteristics of those that qualify as MC.
DESIGN: Primary invasive GB carcinomas (n  =  606) were reviewed for mucinous
differentiation. Some degree of mucin production was identified in 40 cases
(6.6%); however, only 15 (2.5%) were qualified for the World Health Organization 
definition of MC (stromal mucin deposition constituting >50% of the tumor).
RESULTS: The mean age was 65 years, and the female to male ratio was 1.1 (versus 
3.9 for conventional pancreatobiliary-type GB adenocarcinomas; P  =  .04). A
significant proportion of the cases (8 of 12, 67%) presented with the clinical
picture and intraoperative findings that were interpreted as acute cholecystitis.
Mean and median tumor sizes were larger than those of conventional
adenocarcinomas (4.8 and 3.4 cm versus 2.9 and 2.5 cm, respectively; P  =  .01). 
Most (13 of 15, 87%) cases presented with pT3 tumors (versus 48% for ordinary GB 
carcinomas; P  =  .01). Two cases had almost an exclusive colloid pattern (>90%
composed of well-defined stromal mucin nodules that contained scanty carcinoma
cells, most of which were floating within the mucin). Eight cases were of
mixed-mucinous type, showing a mixture of colloid and noncolloid patterns. Five
others had prominent signet-ring cells, both floating within the mucin (which
constituted >50% of the tumor by definition) and infiltrating into the stroma as 
individual signet-ring cells in some areas. Immunohistochemical analysis
performed on the 7 cases that had available tissue revealed CK7 in 4 of 7 (57%), 
CK20 in 2 of 7 (29%), MUC1 in 4 of 7 (57%), MUC2 in 6 of 7 (86%), CDX2 in 1 of 7 
(14%), MUC5AC in 6 of 7 (86%), MUC6 in 0 of 7 (0%), and loss of E-cadherin in 6
of 7 (86%). The MLH1 and MSH2 were retained in 6 of 7 cases (100%). Follow-up
information was available for 13 cases: 11 (85%) died of disease (1-37 months)
and 2 (15%) were alive (23 months and 1 month). Overall survival of MCs was
significantly worse than that of conventional adenocarcinomas (13 versus 26
months; P  =  .01); however, that did not seem to be independent of stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Mucinous carcinomas constitute 2.5% of GB carcinomas. They present
with an acute cholecystitis-type picture. Most MCs are a mixed-mucinous, not pure
colloid, type. They are typically large and advanced tumors at the time of
diagnosis and thus exhibit more-aggressive behavior than do ordinary GB
carcinomas. Immunophenotypically, they differ from conventional GB
adenocarcinomas by MUC2 positivity, from intestinal carcinomas by an often
inverse CK7/20 profile, from pancreatic mucinous carcinomas by CDX2 negativity,
and from mammary colloid carcinomas by a lack of MUC6. Unlike gastrointestinal
MCs, they appear to be microsatellite stable.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder resulting in destruction of
articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, and subchondral bone sclerosis. In
recent years, numerous genetic factors have been identified and implicated in
osteoarthritis. The aim of the current study was to examine the influence of
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T mutation and angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) variations on the risk of
osteoarthritis. Genomic DNA is obtained from 421 persons (221 patients with
osteoarthritis and 200 healthy controls). ACE gene I/D polymorphism genotypes
were determined using polymerase chain reaction using I and D allele-specific
primers. The MTHFR C677T mutation was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods. We found
significant difference between the groups with respect to both ACE and MTHFR
genotype distributions (p< 0.001, p< 0.001 respectively). Our study suggests that
ACE gene DD genotype and MTHFR gene CC genotype could be used as genetic markers 
in osteoarthritis in Turkish study populations.

BACKGROUND: Breast carcinomas can be classified into five subtypes based on gene 
expression profiling or immunohistochemical characteristics. Among these
subtypes, basal-like breast carcinomas (BLBCs) are one of the most studied group,
due to their poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the
prevalance, morphological and immunohistochemical features of BLBCs, in Turkish
population.
METHODS: Five hundred invasive breast carcinomas were reviewed for several
morphological features and immunostained for oestrogen and progesterone
receptors, c-ERB-B2, cytokeratin5/6, cytokeratin14, vimentin and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR). Basal-like breast carcinoma was defined as a triple
negative tumor with cytokeratin5/6 and/or EGFR positive.
RESULTS: The prevalance of BLBC was 9.6%. All medullary carcinomas and 55.6% of
metaplastic carcinomas showed basal-like immunophenotype. Patients with BLBC were
younger (p=0.04) and had higher-grade tumors (p<0.0001). Morphologic features
associated with BLBC included increased mitosis, nuclear pleomorphism, presence
of geographic and/or central necrosis, pushing margin of invasion and stromal
lymphocytic response (p<0.0001). Presence of prominent nucleoli and vesicular
nuclear chromatin were the cytological features correlated with basal-like
phenotype (p<0.0001). On multivariate analyses, BLBCs were associated with high
mitotic number (p<0.0001), the presence of vesicular chromatin (p=0.004), high
tubular grade (p=0.011), lymphocytic response (p=0.031) and the absence of
carcinoma insitu (p=0.039). Vimentin was positive in 53.2% of BLBCs, while
cytokeratin14 was less frequently expressed (27.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: BLBCs have some distinctive, but not pathognomonical, morphological 
features. Paying attention to these features and adding cytokeratin14 and
vimentin to the immunohistochemical panel can help the definitive diagnosis of
BLBCs.

University, Ankara Ataturk Research and Education Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of atypia of undetermined significance
(AUS)/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) rate and outcome.
METHODS: Among 7658 patients with 19 569 nodules, 524 (2.7%) nodules were
diagnosed as AUS/FLUS on fine needle aspiration (FNA). After exclusion of
patients with simultaneous nodules that were suspicious for follicular neoplasm
or malignancy or that were malignant, 368 (4.8%) patients were diagnosed as
AUS/FLUS. The outcome of 146 patients who had undergone surgery or repeated fine 
needle aspirate at the time of preparation of this study was evaluated. The
original FNAs were matched to repeated FNAs and thyroidectomy or diagnostic
lobectomy specimens.
RESULTS: Seventy-two (19.6%) of the 368 patients had directly undergone surgery, 
either a lobectomy or a thyroidectomy: of these, 27 (37.5%) had neoplastic
nodules (21 were malignant). Seventy-four (20.1%) of the 368 patients had repeat 
FNA. On second FNA, 47 of 74 (63.5%) were benign, three were suspicious for
follicular neoplasm, one was malignant and 23 (31.1%) were non-diagnostic. Four
patients had a third FNA: two were AUS/FLUS, one was malignant and one
non-diagnostic. One patient had a fourth FNA, which was diagnosed as AUS/FLUS.
Sixteen (21.6%) of 74 patients with repeat FNA had surgery: three of these had
neoplastic nodules (two were malignant). Overall, 88 of the 368 (23.9%) patients 
had a thyroidectomy of which 30 (34.1%) were neoplastic and 23 (26.1%) malignant.
The neoplastic rate for patients who were once diagnosed with AUS/FLUS was 8.2%
and the malignancy rate 6.3%. The malignancy rate for patients on follow-up at
the time we prepared the study was 15.7% (23/146); 222 remained on follow-up
without surgery or repeat FNA or were managed elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: Although in this category repeat FNA is expected rather than
excision, we suggest evaluation of all AUS/FLUS patients in multidisciplinary
meetings to decide management and recommend follow-up of all patients with this
diagnosis.

For several years, the lack of consensus on definition, nomenclature, natural
history, and biology of serrated polyps (SPs) of the colon has created
considerable confusion among pathologists. According to the latest WHO
classification, the family of SPs comprises hyperplastic polyps (HPs), sessile
serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps), and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs). The 
term SSA/P with dysplasia has replaced the category of mixed
hyperplastic/adenomatous polyps (MPs). The present study aimed to evaluate the
reproducibility of the diagnosis of SPs based on currently available diagnostic
criteria and interactive consensus development. In an initial round, H&E slides
of 70 cases of SPs were circulated among participating pathologists across
Europe. This round was followed by a consensus discussion on diagnostic criteria.
A second round was performed on the same 70 cases using the revised criteria and 
definitions according to the recent WHO classification. Data were evaluated for
inter-observer agreement using Kappa statistics. In the initial round, for the
total of 70 cases, a fair overall kappa value of 0.318 was reached, while in the 
second round overall kappa value improved to moderate (kappa = 0.557; p < 0.001).
Overall kappa values for each diagnostic category also significantly improved in 
the final round, reaching 0.977 for HP, 0.912 for SSA/P, and 0.845 for TSA
(p < 0.001). The diagnostic reproducibility of SPs improves when strictly
defined, standardized diagnostic criteria adopted by consensus are applied.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is uncommon within the central nervous
system. MFH is a malignant tumor composed of a mixture of fibroblastic and
histiocytic cells, and is also known as pleomorphic fibrous xanthoma, malignant
fibrous xanthoma, and pleomorphic fibrous histiocytoma. It is a pleomorphic
sarcoma originally found in soft tissue and there are few reported cases within
the central nervous system, in particular the cerebellum. To the best of my
knowledge, this is third case arising from the cerebellum. This tumor is
difficult to diagnose and may be difficult to treat.

Lipoid proteinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of variable severity
that may involve the skin, mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract and
internal organs that may display different clinical manifestations based on the
site of involvement. A 34-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with
a complaint of hoarseness present since childhood but had worsened in recent
years. A dermatological examination revealed light brown papillomatous skin
lesions on the dorsum of both hands and elbows present for a long duration.
Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed widespread mucosal thickening and
irregularity. Microscopic examination revealed acid Schiff (PAS) positive, Congo 
red negative eosinophilic hyaline material deposits in the dermis and submucosal 
regions. The final diagnosis was lipoid proteinosis with skin and larynx
involvement. This typical case has been reported to draw attention to the fact
that lipoid proteinosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of
patients presenting with hoarseness in childhood.

Kabalar ME(1), Karaman A, Aylu B, Ozmen SA, Erdem I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Genetics, Erzurum Nenehatun Obstetrics and Gynecology
Hospital, Erzurum, Turkey.

CONTEXT: The c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene is a member of the epidermal growth factor
receptor family and has been associated with a more aggressive breast tumor
biology and resistance to some types of treatments.
AIMS: The aim is to investigate the correlation among bcl-2 and c-erbB-2 and the 
micronucleus (MN) formation in patients with early breast cancer (BC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted between May 2010 and December
2011. We analyzed the MN frequencies in 15 patients with invasive breast
carcinoma (IBC), 13 patients with intraductal proliferative lesion (IDPL) and 12 
benign breast lesion (BBL). The sample consisted of 40 formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded blocks of benign and malignant breast tissue. The specimens
were evaluated for bcl-2 or c-erbB-2 immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively
evaluated in at least 1000 cells examined under the microscope at 40Χ
magnification and recorded as the percentage of c-erbB-2 and bcl-2 positive tumor
cells over the total number of cells examined in the same area. The percentage
scores were subsequently categorized using the 5% cut-off point for positive
staining.
RESULTS: The MN was significantly increased in IBC and in IDPL patients compared 
to BBL patients (3.82 ± 0.17 and 2.37 ± 0.52, respectively, vs. 1.61 ± 0.40, P < 
0.001). On other hand, the MN frequencies in IBC patients were higher than those 
in IDPL patients (3.82 ± 0.17 vs. 2.37 ± 0.52, P < 0.01). c-erbB-2, had the
highest record in IBC (60%), and the score was not observed in both IDPL and BBL:
bcl-2 immunostaining was also assessed, the lowest recorded score was in IBC
(46.66%) and the highest in both BBL and IDPL (100%). Furthermore, there was a
significantly difference in the mean MN frequency between c-erbB-2 positive IBC
patients (4.06 ± 0.48) and c-erbB-2 negative IBC patients (3.44 ± 0.39) (P <
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased chromosome / DNA instabilities
may be associated with the pathogenesis of early BC.

Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas are rare neoplasms which are
usually not associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in immunocompetent patients.
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of EBV in primary CNS
lymphomas in the Turkish population. Thirty-two primary CNS lymphomas diagnosed
according to the WHO 2008 criteria were included in this study. The presence of
EBV small ribonucleic acids was investigated by in situ hybridization using EBV
encoded small RNA oligonucleotides. The expression of CD10, Bcl-6, MUM-1/IRF-4,
Bcl-2, and Ki-67 were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The patient cohort
included 20 male patients and 12 female patients with a median age of 53.5 years 
(range 13-75). Seven (22%) of cases were classified as germinal center (GC) and
25 (78%) cases as non-GC phenotype according to the Hans criteria. Twenty-six
(81%) of the cases showed strong Bcl-2 expression and the median Ki-67 index was 
78%. EBV expression was observed in four primary CNS lymphoma cases (12.5%). Most
primary CNS lymphomas show non-GC phenotype with high Bcl-2 expression and high
proliferative rate. The incidence of EBV in primary CNS lymphomas from Turkey
appears to be higher than that observed in the Western countries.

Gastric xanthelasmas are uncommon benign lesions that are macroscopically
well-demarcated yellow or yellow-white plaques and are microscopically formed by 
collections of foamy macrophages. Because gastric hyperplastic polyps may rarely 
be associated with xanthelasma, we aimed to report 5 cases of combined lesions
showing features of gastric xanthelasma and hyperplastic polyps observed over the
past 3 years at our institution among 4497 patients who underwent gastric
endoscopy. The patients were 3 men and 2 women aged 45 to 78 years. The lesions
were located in oxyntic mucosa, except one in the antrum, and measured 2 to 6 mm.
Three patients showed associated chronic gastritis; none showed evidence of
Helicobacter pylori infection. Combined lesions of hyperplastic polyp with
xanthelasma appear to have an association with chronic gastritis, and the lipid
accumulation may be the cause of hyperplasia in the overlying mucosa.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether inherited thrombophilia increases the
risk of pre-eclampsia (PE) or interferes with its clinical course.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 50 patients with severe PE and 50 healthy
pregnant women. Patients were evaluated for inherited thrombophilia.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients in the study group was factor V Leiden (FVL) carrier
while it was 12% in the control group. In women with PE, FVL and other inherited 
thrombophilic factors were not more prevalent than in the controls.
CONCLUSION: The present study failed to demonstrate an association between the
inherited thrombophilias and PE.

BACKGROUND: In many tumors including ovarian cancer, cell proliferation and
apoptosis are important in pathogenesis and there are many alterations in most of
the genes related to the cell cycle. This study was designed to evaluate
immunohistochemistry with apoptotic-antiapoptotic proteins (p53, p21, bax, and
bcl-2), c-kit, telomerase, and metallothionein as a diagnostic aid in typing of
benign, borderline, and malignant serous and mucinous ovarian tumors.
METHODS: Total of 68 ovarian tumors, 25 benign [13 (19.1%) serous and 12 (17.6%) 
mucinous], 16 borderline [9 (13.2%) serous and 7(10.3%) mucinous], and 27
malignant ovarian tumors [24 (35.3%) serous and 3 (4.4%) mucinous tumors] were
included in the study. Immunohistochemical expression of p53, p21, bax, bcl-2,
telomerase, c-kit, and metallothionein were evaluated.
RESULTS: When all 68 cases were evaluated as benign, borderline, and malignant
ovarian tumors without considering histopathological subtypes, the p53, p21, bax 
and metallothionein showed significantly higher staining scores in the borderline
and malignant ones (p < 0.05). After evaluation of all 68 cases, the serous
tumors showed significantly higher staining scores of p53, p21, c-kit, and
metallothionein compared to the mucinous ones (p < 0.05). For differentiation of 
benign and borderline and malignant tumors combined, p53 was not used because all
benign tumors has no staining, and p21, bax, and metallothionein was determined
the significant predictors for borderline and malignant tumors combined
(p < 0.05). For differentiation of borderline and malignant tumors, only p53 was 
determined the significant predictor for malignant tumors (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, p53, p21, bax, c-kit, and metallothionein may be
helpful for the typing of ovarian tumors as benign, borderline and malignant or
serous and mucinous. p53, p21, bax, c-kit, and metallothionein may have different
roles in the pathogenesis of ovarian tumor types. p53 and metallothionein may be 
helpful in the typing of borderline and malignant ovarian tumors. The
immunohistochemical staining with bcl-2 and telomerase may not provide meaningful
contribution for the typing of ovarian tumors.

Common Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene mutations associated with ankylosing
spondylitis in Turkish population.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, which has already been identified as being
responsible for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), is also a suspicious gene for
AS because of the clinical association of these two diseases. The aim of this
study was to explore the frequency and clinical significance of MEFV gene
mutations (M694V, M680I, V726A, E148Q and P369S) in a cohort of Turkish patients 
with AS. Genomic DNAs of 103 AS patients and 120 controls were isolated and
genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) methods. There was a statistically significant difference of 
the MEFV gene mutation carrier rates between AS patients and healthy controls
(p=0.004, OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.32-4.76). This association was also observed in
allele frequencies (p=0.005, OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.27-4.2). A relatively higher
frequency was observed for M694V mutation in AS patients than controls (10.7%
versus 4.2% , p=0.060). There were no significant differences between MEFV
mutation carriers and non-carriers with respect to the clinical and demographic
characteristics. The results of this study suggest that MEFV gene mutations are
positively associated with a predisposition to develop AS.

OBJECTIVE: Cardiac visceral fat is accepted to be a new marker for
cardiometabolic risk due to its association with increased cardiovascular risk
factors. This study aimed to compare the expression of 11 beta hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenases (11β-HSD)-1, glucocorticoid receptor (GCR), and CD68 in
mediastinal and subcutaneous adipose tissues (MAT, and SAT, respectively) and to 
assess their possible relationships with the development of coronary artery
disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of 11β-HSD-1, GCR, and CD68 mRNA levels were
measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in MAT and SAT
tissues of 37 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting due to CAD (CAD
group) and 19 non-CAD patients (controls) undergoing heart valve surgery.
11β-HSD-1 in MAT and SAT and GCR expression in MAT and SAT were found to be
significantly increased in CAD group when compared with controls (P<.05,
respectively). In CAD group, 11β-HSD-1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly
higher in MAT compared to SAT (P<.05). CD68 mRNA levels were significantly higher
in MAT of CAD group compared to controls (P<.05). Immunohistochemical analyses
demonstrated the presence of CD68+ cells and increased 11β-HSD-1 expression in
MAT of CAD group compared to SAT.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrate that the mediastinal fat exhibits a
pathogenic mRNA profile of 11β-HSD-1, GCR, and CD68. The identification of
11β-HSD-1 expression within the mediastinal fat, along with increased GCR
expressions and the presence of CD68+ cells highlight that MAT potentially
contributes to the pathogenesis of CAD.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a unique case report about late and isolated vulvar
metastasis of sigmoid adeno-carcinoma with review of the literature.
MATERIAL-METHOD: 57 year old postmenopausal patient with prior sigmoid colon
cancer history was admitted with isolated vulvar mass. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and KRAS gen mutation analysis following surgery were performed to discriminate
the metastasis from a vulvar primary malignancy. Further imaging techniques were 
also performed to exclude additional tumours.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and KRAS gene mutation analysis revealed
isolated metastasis of the colonic adeno-carcinoma in the vulva.
CONCLUSION: Isolated and late occurring vulvar metastasis of colonic origin is
very unusual. Careful evaluation and IHC is useful for such cases.

BACKGROUND: In this study, the clinical and morphological features of
vesiculobullous lesions observed in Kaposi sarcoma are analyzed, and the features
of bullous Kaposi sarcoma cases are emphasized.
METHODS: A total of 178 biopsy materials of 75 cases diagnosed as classic-type
cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma were reviewed. Twenty-five cases showing vesiculobullous
features were included in the study. Tumor, epidermis, dermis, and clinical data 
regarding these cases was evaluated.
RESULTS: Vesicular changes were observed in 21 (12%) out of 178 lesions of the 75
cases, while bullous changes were present in only 4 (2%). In all cases where
vesicular and bullous changes were detected, tumor, epidermis, and dermis changes
were similar. All cases were nodular stage KS lesions, whereas hyperkeratosis and
serum exudation in the epidermis, marked edema in the dermis, and enlarged
lymphatic vessels and chronic inflammatory response were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that changes in vascular resistance occurring
during tumor progression are the most important factors comprising
vesiculobullous morphology.

Gender is considered to be an important factor in endotoxin-induced tissue
damage. Our aim was to examine the role of sex on the prooxidant-antioxidant
status, necrotic and apoptotic events in the liver of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-treated rats. We determined levels of lipid peroxides, non-enzymatic and
enzymatic antioxidants, and expressions of apoptosis-related proteins,
antiapoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and proapoptotic Bax, caspase-3 activity 
and apoptotic cell numbers in the liver. Hepatic histopathology and serum alanine
transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities were also
investigated. Male and female Wistar rats (180-200 g) were injected with LPS (10 
mg/kg, i.p.) and examinations were performed 6 h after the injection. Significant
increases in hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and diene conjugate 
levels were observed in male and female rats following LPS treatment. However,
there were no changes in hepatic glutathione, vitamin E and vitamin C levels
together with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione
transferase activities. LPS treatment caused significant increases in serum ALT
and AST activities and lymphocyte infiltration and necrotic changes in the
livers. Bcl-2 and Bax expressions, caspase-3 activity and apoptotic cell numbers 
were also found to be increased in both groups. In conclusion, no sex-dependent
difference was observed in the changed hepatic prooxidant-antioxidant status of
rats following LPS treatment. Besides, the process leading to apoptosis and
necrosis in the liver showed a similar pattern in both gender of rats.

Thymosin beta-4 (Tβ(4)) is a major actin-sequestering molecule that contributes
to cell growth, differentiation, motility, survival, mitosis and angiogenesis. It
is overexpressed in certain type of carcinoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines and is 
associated with metastatic potential. The aim of this study was to investigate
the relationship between Tβ(4) expression and clinicopathologic features and VEGF
status in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Retrospectively, 60 GISTs were
re-examined and immunohistochemistry for Tβ(4) and VEGF was performed. Increased 
expression of Tβ(4) and VEGF was observed in 26 (43.3%) and in 19 (31.6%) of the 
tumors, respectively. Tβ(4) expression was positively correlated with VEGF
expression (p < 0.01). Tβ(4) and VEGF expression were significantly associated
with tumor size (p = 0.00 and p = 0.02, respectively) and high mitosis (p = 0.03 
and p = 0.00, respectively). Although Tβ(4) expression was positively associated 
with pleomorphism (p = 0.01), VEGF expression was positively associated with
necrosis (p = 0.03). Tβ(4) expression was related with local recurrence and/or
metastasis (p = 0.03), but VEGF expression was not (p = 0.12). We firstly
demonstrate the presence of Tβ(4) protein in GISTs. Our study reveals that
increased expression of Tβ(4) could be considered as an indicator of aggressive
behavior of tumor.

The differences between invasive lobular and ductal carcinomas affect the
diagnostic and therapeutic management for patients with breast cancer. In most
cases, this can be accomplished because of distinct histomorphologic features.
However, occasionally, this task may become quite difficult, in particular when
dealing with the variants of infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Lobular carcinoma
has been considered a variant of mucin-secreting carcinoma with only
intracytoplasmic mucin. The presence of extracellular mucin is a feature of
ductal carcinoma. Herein is presented a case of lobular carcinoma with
extracellular and intracellular mucin in a 43-year-old female patient, and
confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Up to the present, infiltrating lobular
carcinoma displaying extracellular mucin has not been described in the literature
except two case. Virtual slides: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be

University, Istanbul, Turkey. drmukaddes@hotmail.com

Microscopic features and antioxidant status of kidneys of young, old, and caffeic
acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and melatonin administered old Sprague Dawley rats
were evaluated. Aging-related tubular and glomerular changes were evident. The
most prominent tubular alterations were massive vacuole formation, mitochondrial 
degeneration, and lysosome accumulation. Mean tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) level 
was increased, mean tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) (p < .001),
and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities (p < .05), and total glutathione
(GSH) level were decreased in old animals. Melatonin significantly reduced tissue
MDA levels (p < .005), but increased tissue SOD (p < .001), CAT, and GPx
activities (p < .05), and GSH levels (p < .005) in old animals. CAPE also
significantly reduced tissue MDA levels (p < .005), but increased tissue SOD (p <
.05), CAT (p < .005), GPx activities, and GSH levels (p < .001) in old rats. Mean
tissue MDA levels of melatonin and CAPE-administered rats were even lower than
those of young rats (p < .05). In conclusion, tubular and glomerular structures
and tissue antioxidant enzyme activities were very well preserved in CAPE and
melatonin-administered rats.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to report an experience with thyroid
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cases that can be placed into National Cancer
Institute-designated thyroid FNA diagnostic categories for follicular patterned
lesions divided into three diagnostic categories: follicular lesion of
undetermined significance/atypia of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS),
suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFON), and suspicious for malignancy.
STUDY DESIGN: The study cohort included 4,284 cases for the period between
January 2007 and July 2011 and all available follow-up data was obtained. All
cases classified as 'atypical' and 'rule out follicular neoplasm' were included
in the AUS/FLUS category (n = 3,903), whereas cases classified as 'suspicious
for' or 'consistent with follicular or Hürthle cell neoplasm' (n = 381) were
included in the SFON diagnostic category and compared with histopathologic
follow-up.
RESULTS: During this period, 14,628 thyroid FNAs were reported in 12,238
patients. Repeat FNA (RFNA) was performed in 1,366/3,903 (35%) patients
classified as AUS/FLUS. Histologic outcome data was available in 1,756/3,903
(45%) cases diagnosed as AUS/FLUS and 243/381 (64%) cases diagnosed as SFON. The 
rate of malignancy in AUS/FLUS cases with and without RFNA was 29 and 14%
respectively, and it was 26% in SFON cases.
CONCLUSION: The current data shows that the malignancy rates differ between
categories and AUS/FLUS cases are best managed by RFNA for selection of cases
that can benefit from surgical excision.

Manisa, Turkey.

The aim of this study was to determine serum vitamin B12, folic acid and
homocysteine (Hcy) levels as well as MTHFR (C677, A1298C) gene polymorphisms in
patients with vitiligo, and to compare the results with healthy controls. Forty
patients with vitiligo and 40 age and sex matched healthy subjects were studied. 
Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were determined by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Plasma Hcy levels and MTHFR polymorphisms were determined by
chemiluminescence and real time PCR methods, respectively. Mean serum vitamin B12
and Hcy levels were not significantly different while folic acid levels were
significantly lower in the control group. There was no significant relationship
between disease activity and vitamin B12, folic acid and homocystein levels. No
significant difference in C677T gene polymorphism was detected. Heterozygote
A1298C gene polymorphism in the patient group was statistically higher than the
control group. There was no significant relationship between MTHFR gene
polymorphisms and vitamin B12, folic acid and homocysteine levels. In conclusion,
vitamin B12, folate and Hcy levels are not altered in vitiligo and MTHFR gene
mutations (C677T and A1298C) do not seem to create susceptibility for vitiligo.

AIM: In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the
histological fibrosis stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and serum
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to determine the usefulness of this
relationship in clinical practice.
METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 51 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD
and 28 healthy controls, and serum levels of CTGF were assayed by ELISA.
RESULTS: Levels of CTGF were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD compared
with controls (P=0.001). The serum CTGF levels were significantly increased, that
correlated with histological fibrosis stage, in patients with NAFLD [in patients 
with no fibrosis (stage 0) 308.2 ± 142.9, with mild fibrosis (stage 1-2) 519.9 ± 
375.2 and with advanced fibrosis (stage 3-4) 1353.2 ± 610 ng/l, P < 0.001]. Also 
serum level of CTGF was found as an independent predictor of histological
fibrosis stage in patients with NAFLD (β = 0.662, t=5.6, P <0.001). The area
under the ROC curve was estimated 0.931 to separate patients with severe fibrosis
from patients with other fibrotic stages.
CONCLUSION: Serum levels of CTGF may be a clinical utility for distinguishing
NAFLD patients with and without advanced fibrosis.

AIMS: In many neurodegenerative diseases and following traumas, dying back
degeneration is a common phenomenon that aggravates the pathology and may
eventually lead to death of the affected neurone. We aimed to investigate the
mechanism of dying back degeneration with an in vitro axonal injury model.
METHODS: We cultured adult mouse dorsal root ganglion neurones and with a precise
laser beam, cut the axons they extended. Preparations were imaged continuously
and images were analysed to describe and quantify ensuing events. Potential
contributions of calpains and caspases to the degeneration were explored using
specific inhibitors and immunohistochemistry. In vivo implications of the results
were sought in nerve sections after sciatic nerve cut.
RESULTS: The proximal part of the transected axons went under basically two types
of dying back degeneration, fragmentation and retraction. In fragmentation the
cytoplasm became condensed and with concomitant axial collapse the axon
disintegrated into small pieces. In retraction, the severed axon was pulled back 
to the soma in an organized manner. We demonstrated that fragmentation was
associated with a high risk of cell death, while survival rate with retraction
was as high as those of uninjured neurones. Regeneration of transected axon was
more likely after retraction than following fragmentation. Activities of
caspase-3 and calpains but not of caspase-6 were found linked with retraction and
regeneration but not with the fragmentation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes two quite distinct types of dying back
degeneration that lead an injured neurone to quite different fates.

Diffuse peritoneal malignant mesothelioma is a rare, progressive, and ultimately 
fatal disease and it can present as primary peritoneal carcinoma or ovarian
cancer. Differential diagnosis is important to establish appropriate management. 
In this article the clinical presentation, immunuhistochemical and
histopathological features of 8 diffuse peritoneal malignant mesothelioma cases
presented as peritoneal carcinoma or ovarian cancer are evaluated. According to
findings of all reported cases, we concluded that clinical distinction of
malignant mesothelioma from ovarian cancer or peritoneal adenocarcinoma is very
difficult. Differential diagnosis is reliably achieved by immune profile of the
tumors with a systematic approach of both positive and negative mesothelioma
markers.

BACKGROUND: Fascin and CD44v6 may have significant roles as biomarkers in tumour 
progression and metastasis. In endometrioid carcinomas, the fascin expression
profile is less defined, and the significance of CD44v6 is uncertain. We aimed to
investigate the expressions of both fascin and CD44v6 in endometrioid carcinomas 
and to evaluate their inter-relation with clinicopathological parameters.
METHODS: Fascin and CD44v6 expressions were evaluated, individually and in
combination, in a series of 47 endometrioid carcinomas and 10 proliferative
endometrium samples. The staining extent and intensity of both markers in tumour 
cells were scored semiquantitatively. The relationship between immunoexpressions 
and clinicopathological variables was assessed.
RESULTS: The expression rates of fascin and CD44v6 in endometrioid carcinoma were
72.34% and 46.80%, respectively. Although these expression rates were higher than
those in proliferative endometrial samples, fascin expression showed a
statistically significant difference from the normal group (p = 0.02), but CD44v6
did not differ (p = 0.54). Fascin expression was significantly correlated with
tumour grade (p = 0.003) and neural invasion (p = 0.036) in a univariate
analysis. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between CD44v6 and
any of the clinicopathological parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fascin might be an independent prognostic 
indicator in the different steps of extracellular matrix invasion. On the other
hand, CD44v6 was not a predictive factor in endometrioid cancer.

Feasibility and clinical utility of intraoperative consultation with frozen
section in osseous lesions.

Intraoperative consultation (IOC) with frozen section (FS) allows the surgeon to 
make therapy decisions during the operation. However, there is relatively little 
information on the use of IOC in skeletal lesions. We performed a retrospective
study to examine the indications for IOC and compare the histological findings of
FS and permanent paraffin section (PS) results to determine its clinical
benefits. Ninety-seven consecutive cases evaluated between 2008 and 2011 were
retrieved from IOC archives of our Pathology Department. In 79 % of the cases,
there was no prior core needle biopsy (CNB), and IOC was performed to confirm the
clinical or radiological diagnosis. In 5 (5 %) cases, no definitive result could 
be obtained with FS, and diagnosis was deferred. The reasons for a deferred
diagnosis (DD) included poor section quality in two lipomatous lesions and the
sample heterogeneity in the others. When adjusted for DD, FS and PS results
showed 100 % concordance in terms of discriminating "benign vs. malignant" and
defining diagnostic categories as "benign non-tumoral," "benign
tumoral/tumor-like," "malignant primary tumor," "malignant metastatic tumor," or 
"hematopoietic malignancy." The presence of non-sclerotic osseous tissues does
not have a significant adverse impact on the FS section quality and diagnosis
made by FS. Thus, sections with diagnostic value can be obtained from bone
lesions via FS. In this study, specific diagnoses were made in 88 % of the cases.
We believe that IOC with FS can be safely performed in tertiary referral centers 
where there is a multidisciplinary team working in collaboration.

In 2009 winter, Influenza A (H1N1) monovalent split virus vaccine was used
prevalently in the whole world as a result of the pandemic caused by Influenza
(H1N1) virus. The vaccine's adverse effects were observed closely and vaccination
has been found as safe in most studies. But some reports about immune response
related diseases after influenza vaccinations are remarkable. The close
relationship between membranous glomerulonephritis and antigens is known,
particularly in seconder forms which occur after viral infections and
vaccinations. So this case report is about a 56-year-old man, who developed
membranous glomerulonephritis 23 days after the vaccination against Influenza A
(H1N1) virus.

It has been shown that BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC)
is associated both with pathogenesis and poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed 
to investigate the relationship of the BRAF(V600E) mutation and the established
prognostic factors in a cohort of Turkish patients with PTC. Forty-six cases of
papillary thyroid carcinoma have been evaluated for the presence of BRAF(V600E)
mutation. BRAF(V600E) has been examined by restriction fragment length
polymorphism. BRAF(V600E) mutation status has been compared with well-known
histopathological and clinical prognostic parameters such as invasion of thyroid 
capsule, extrathyroidal extension, and the presence of lymph node and/or distant 
metastasis. We have found that BRAF(V600E) mutation was present in the majority
of our cases (40/46). Considering the stage of the disease, five of the negative 
cases were in stage 1 while the remaining one was in stage 2. Only one
BRAF(V600E) negative case has shown extrathyroidal extension and lymph node
metastasis. All four patients with distant metastasis had BRAF(V600E) mutation.
Statistical analyses revealed that there are no significant relationship between 
the BRAF(V600E) mutation and the established prognostic factors. We found a
relatively higher BRAF(V600E) mutation rate in classical type PTC than in other
similar studies. We think that the limited number of our cases may either weaken 
or mask some potentially important relationship between BRAF(V600E) mutation and 
the established prognostic factors.

An investigation of growth factors and lactoferrin in naturally occurring ovine
pulmonary adenomatosis.

Ovine pulmonary adenomatosis (OPA), also known as jaagsiekte, is a transmissible 
beta retrovirus-induced lung tumour of sheep that has several features resembling
human bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC). Angiogenesis has been suggested to be one 
of the most important factors underlying tumour growth and invasion. This process
involves the action of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-C, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF)-C and its receptor (PDGFR-α). Bovine lactoferrin (bLF), an iron and
heparin-binding glycoprotein secreted into various biological fluids, has been
implicated in innate immunity and has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour
functions. Tissues from 16 cases of OPA were compared with tissues from seven
healthy control sheep by immunohistochemistry. Expression of the markers was
assessed semi-quantitatively by ascribing an immunoreactivity score (IRS) with a 
maximum value of 300. VEGF-C, bFGF, PDGF-C, PDGFR-α and bLF signals were detected
in 10/16, 15/16, 12/16, 15/16 and 10/16 of the OPA cases studied, respectively.
bLF expression was weak in the neoplastic epithelial cells (IRS 21.4 ± 10.0) in
contrast to high levels detected in infiltrating macrophages and plasma cells
(IRS 141.3 ± 24.8 and 140.0 ± 25.1, respectively). The PDGFR-α IRS was elevated
for neoplastic epithelial cells (108.9 ± 18.2) and was lowest for macrophages and
plasma cells (20.4 ± 13.1 and 13.7 ± 12.4, respectively). These results suggest
that bFGF, VEGF-C and PDGF-C have roles in the pathogenesis of OPA. bLF may
activate macrophages and plasma cells in these lesions, but limited expression of
bLF by neoplastic cells may be a consequence of defective or impaired function of
this molecule.

We aimed to compare ratios of thyroid cancers diagnosed in our regional reference
hospital Pathology Center in Sanliurfa city located in southeast Anatolia, and
evaluate the characteristics related with follicular variant papillary thyroid
carcinoma (FVPTC). We re-evaluated the specimens of last 5 years thyroidectomies 
by same five pathologists, by same criteria and immunohistochemical evaluation.
Chi-square test was used to compare characteristics of classical pure papillary
thyroid carcinomas and FVPTC groups. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was
used to evaluate the factors related with presence of FVPTC. Among 400
thyroidectomies, there were 105 papillary thyroid carcinoma, 42 of them with pure
PTC, and 56 with FVPC, also seven with other variants. There was increase in
ratios of FVPTC/PTC between 2010 and 2011 (68.4 vs 76.7%, p < 0.005). Radius,
vascular invasion, and extrathyroidal invasion showed statistically significant
difference between pure PTC and FVPTC. In regression analysis radius (p = 0.001, 
OR = 2.611; 95%CI, 2.010-3.391), age (p = 0.018, OR = 0.959; 95%CI, 0.927-0.993),
and multicentricity (p = 0.044, OR = 0.403; 95%CI, 0.167-0.975) were related with
presence of FVPTC. Besides, further need for studies to understand whether total 
prevalence of FVPTC is higher in this region, and the related factors, our study 
showed that the ratio of FVPTC/PTC is higher in our reference hospital. Age of
the patients and the radius and multicentricity of the nodules could be alarming 
factors for us to suspect for FVPTC.

Neopterin, a pteridine group compound that is secreted from macrophages is shown 
to be increased in adult leukemia; however there are few studies in childhood
leukemia. This study aimed to investigate neopterin levels during childhood
leukemia treatment and neutropenic fever episodes for the possibility of using as
a marker for disease activity and differentiation of infections. A total of 44
children with acute leukemia, 19 children with infection (control group 1) and 21
healthy children (control group 2) were studied. Median serum neopterin level
before induction chemotherapy (day 0) in 25 children (patient group 1) was
significantly higher (27.7 nmol/L) than those at the beginning of 30 febrile
episodes in 19 children in bone marrow remission (2.2 nmol/L) (patient group 2)
and in control group 2 (0.4 nmol/L) (p< 0.05). It was (27.7 nmol/L) also
significantly higher in control group 1 than in patient group 2 and control group
2 (p< 0.05). Serum neopterin levels at day 15 (2.1 mmol/L) and day 33 (0.4
mmol/L) of induction were significantly lower than day 0 of ALL subgroup at
patient group 1. There were no significant difference in neopterin levels between
days 0, 3 and 5 of neutropenic fever as well as between patients with
microbiologically and/or clinically documented infections and those with fever of
unknown origin in patient group 2 (p> 0.05). Serum neopterin did not show
significant correlation with absolute neutrophil count and absolute monocyte
count (p> 0.05). In conclusion, elevated neopterin at diagnosis of leukemia with 
decrement during induction therapy suggest that it might be an indicator of
leukemic process; however larger studies for its role in identifying infections
are warranted.

A 2-day-old Simmental calf with arthrogryposis and astasia was subjected to
necropsy examination. The calf was normoglycaemic and normoinsulinaemic.
Microscopically, pancreatic tissue was hyperplastic with an irregular lobular
arrangement of pancreatic islets. Newly-formed islet cells budded from
intralobular or intercalated ducts (so-called ductulo-insular complexes) and
there were prominent blood vessels with telangiectatic features surrounded by
rows of cuboidal-columnar islet cells. The newly-formed islets expressed insulin 
antigen immunohistochemically. The lesion was diagnosed as nesidioblastosis, an
uncommon abnormality previously associated with the double muscling trait in
cattle.

Melatonin and CAPE are able to prevent the liver from oxidative damage in rats:
an ultrastructural and biochemical study.

University, Istanbul, Turkey.

The liver continuously produces free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
as part of metabolic process. These free radicals are neutralized by an elaborate
antioxidant defense system consisting of enzymes and numerous nonenzymatic
antioxidants like flavonoids. In this study, we have evaluated effects of
melatonin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) to young and aged rat liver.
Aging-related hepatic changes examined by light and electron microscopy and
biochemical methods. Melatonin and CAPE decreased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA)
levels in aged rats. Melatonin elevated tissue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)
activity and tGSH level, whereas CAPE elevated tissue catalase activity in aged
rats. This study demonstrates that both melatonin and CAPE are beneficial in
delaying age-related hepatocellular changes. Melatonin and CAPE supplementation
in older ages may support liver to protect itself from various damaging agents
including infectious agents and toxins.

Dental Diseases Hospital, Clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Istanbul,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of Matrix
Metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, Metalloproteinases-7, Metalloproteinases-10 and
Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in the pathogenesis of oral
lichen planus (OLP) disease in same tissue samples.
METHODS: Thirty-nine individuals [29 patients with OLP (74%) and 10 healthy
control subjects (25%)] were included in our study. The mean age was 48 ± 14.39
with a range of 20-75.
RESULTS: MMP-2 and MMP-7 expression was significantly different in the patient
and control groups in the epithelium and the connective tissue (P<0. 05). The
ratio of MMP-2/TIMP-1 and MMP-7/TIMP-1 were higher in patient with OLP group than
control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Along with the exposure of the role of MMPs activity on diseases
characterized by the tissue destruction, several studies were conducted on the
pharmacological control of MMPs activity. However, understanding of the
biological functions of MMPs is very important for the development and
implementation of MMP inhibitors in the treatment of diseases. According to the
results of this study, we suggest that MMP-2, MMP-7, and TIMP-1 may be involved
in the formation of OLP lesions. Further studies on MMPs may be useful for
understanding and treating the diseases such as OLP.

A 31-year-old male patient with a fatal thrombosis of the internal carotid artery
caused by gun shot injury was presented in this case report. The patient was
referred to the hospital with a diffuse edema on his left cheek. On
otolaryngologic examination, there was a bullet entrance hole at the left
mandibular corpus. No exit hole could be found. The finding from his axial
computed tomography of neck and paranasal sinuses was normal. On neurological
examination, a dense right hemiparesis was observed. In his cerebral angiogram,
left common carotid artery was totally obliterated. Diffuse ischemia was observed
in the left cerebral hemisphere. Despite intensive interventions, the patient
died 4 days after the accident. In the autopsy, a large thrombosis was obtained
in the left common carotid artery. This case emphasizes a fatal kinetic energy
effect in vascular structures. It is stressed that a gun shot injury could be
fatal with its indirect kinetic energy effects at subacute phase.

Expression of cytokeratin 19, HBME-1 and galectin-3 in neoplastic and
nonneoplastic thyroid lesions.

Mataraci EA(1), Ozgüven BY, Kabukçuoglu F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Sisli Etfal Education and Research Hospital, Turkey.

In this study, 105 cases of thyroid lesions were evaluated to assess the role of 
HBME-1, cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), galectin-3 in distinguishing benign from
malignant thyroid lesions. Thirty-seven papillary, 10 follicular, 6 medullary, 1 
mixed medullary follicular cell carcinoma, 3 poorly differentiated carcinoma, 18 
adenomatous nodular hyperplasia, 30 follicular adenoma cases were included in the
study. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with HBME-1, CK-19, galectin-3 
on cross-sections derived from selected paraffin blocks. Benign and malignant
lesions were compared in terms of intensity, percentage and type of staining with
CK-19, HBME-1 and galectin-3, and a statistically significant difference (p <
0.05) was found. The percentage and intensity of staining was higher in malignant
lesions. Especially, strong and diffuse expressions of CK19, HBME-1 and
galectin-3 were observed in papillary carcinomas. Membranous (luminal) staining
was seen more frequently in malignant lesions; cytoplasmic staining in benign
lesions. It was concluded that these markers could assist in the diagnosis of
thyroid lesions with cellular properties suspicious for the diagnosis of
papillary carcinoma and without capsule and vessel invasion. They may be used
especially in cases where the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma,
follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma are confused with each other and
follicular adenoma cannot be differentiated from follicular carcinoma.

The objective of this study is to evaluate fetal and maternal outcomes of twin
pregnancies with intrauterine single fetal death. In 13 cases, intrauterine death
of one fetus was found during the first trimester; in 25 cases, it was found
after the first trimester. Obstetric complications and fibrinogen levels were
compared. There were no significant differences in the number of preterm
delivery, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction and there were
significant differences in gestational age at delivery and birth weight between
groups. Coagulation disorders did not occur. The risk for adverse pregnancy
outcomes with a single fetal death during and after the first trimester is
similar.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is one of the most common female malignancy with
high mortality rates in developing countries. Our purpose was to determine the
prevalence of cervical cytologic abnormalities in population (strict Islamic
religious area) and the detection rate of epithelial abnormalities by cervical
cytology (CC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 32,026 conventional pap smear tests collected
between January 2006 and January 2010 from three hospitals are retrospectively
analyzed.
RESULTS: Total of 900 (2.8%) cases had epithelial abnormalities. The numbers and 
rates of epithelial abnormalities were as the followings: Atypical squamous cell 
of undetermined significance (ASCUS; n=615 [1.9%]); atypical squamous cell
suspicious for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H; n=27 [0.1%]);
atypical glandular cell of undetermined significance (AGUS; n=73 [0.2%]); low-
grade squamous intraepitelial lesion (LSIL; n=147 [0.5%]); high- grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL; n=35 [0.1%]); and squamous cell carinoma (SCC; n=3 
[0.0%]).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cervical cytological abnormality in our study was
2.8%. Recently, some conflicting results from the same population were published.
More prospective studies with larger numbers are needed.

Canavan disease is a severe autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by
macrocephaly, ataxia, severe motor and mental retardation, dysmyelination, and
progressive spongial atrophy of the brain. The human aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, 
which catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetyl-L-aspartate, is mutated in Canavan 
disease. In the presented family sequencing analysis for the aspartoacylase gene 
was performed on the blood samples of the parents as the affected child had died 
due to Canavan disease. After the mutation was detected, prenatal diagnosis was
also performed and heterozygous Y88X mutation was detected in the fetus. In this 
report, we present a novel mutation Y88X within the aspartoacylase gene in a
consanguineous family with an affected child diagnosed as Canavan disease.

CD10 is known to be expressed in certain types of leukemia, in lymphomas and also
in various types of carcinoma. However, data regarding CD10 expression in soft
tissue sarcomas is scarce. Two hundred and two retrospective soft tissue sarcoma 
specimens were evaluated for CD10 expression immunohistochemically. The clinical 
records of these patients were reviewed, and clinical data was obtained for all
patients. Our results showed that 90 of the 202 cases were found to express CD10.
72% of malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 45% of fibrosarcomas, 34% of
rhabdomyosarcomas, 50% of leiomyosarcomas, 22% of liposarcomas, 72% of malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and 0% of the primitive neuroectodermal tumors
were positive for CD10. Nearly half of the soft tissue sarcomas were found to
express CD10. Stronger CD10 expression was found in high grade sarcomas.

Cyclooxygenase-2 and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase enzymes may have a
role in developing preclinical atherosclerosis. Designed groups were as follows: 
smoke exposed rats before and during pregnancy, only before pregnancy, and
controls. Cross-sectional samples of abdominal aorta were examined
immunohistochemically. Cyclooxygenase-2 and eNOS expression was evaluated
semi-quantitatively through staining extent (focal, diffuse) and staining
intensity. Diffuse COX-2 expression was detected in study groups. Endothelial NO 
synthase expression was diffuse in study groups. COX-2 and eNOS may contribute to
the formation of preatherosclerotic lesions in offspring of rats exposed to
cigarette smoke through inflammatory response.

Bladder exstrophy is a very rare congenital malformation in which the anterior
wall of the bladder is absent, and the posterior wall is exposed externally. The 
differential diagnosis includes omphalocele, gastroschisis, and cloacal
exstrophy. Ultrasound and Doppler examinations are the main diagnostic tools.
Although mortality is low, termination of pregnancy should be discussed due to
serious morbidities.

Large placental chorioangiomas (LPCs) are rare complications of pregnancy and
these tumors are associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications. We
presented a LPC case at 25th week of gestation, complicated by polyhydramnios and
preterm labor in which intratumoral alcohol injection was performed succesfully. 
Cordocentesis, fetal intrauterine transfusion, and amnioreduction were performed 
at the same session, as a combined approach. The safety of the procedure was
shown by the lack of alcohol in the fetal cord blood sample. Intratumoral alcohol
injection is a reliable and effective treatment modality in the management of
LPCs and may be combined with other invasive procedures.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of UbcH10 expression in the
differential diagnosis of benign, hyperplastic, and malignant endometrial tissues
and also the relationship of UbcH10 with the clinicopathologic parameters of
malignant cases. A tissue microarray was performed for 81 endometrial curettage
biopsies, which histological diagnosis had demonstrated to be 13 cases of
proliferative endometrium, 7 cases of disordered proliferative endometrium, 5
cases of complex atypical hyperplasia, 24 cases of nonatypical hyperplasia, and
32 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Expression of UbcH10 was assessed by
immunohistochemistry. When groups were compared according to UbcH10 percentages
and scores, a statistically significant difference was found only between the
carcinoma group and the other groups, except the complex atypical hyperplasia
group (P < .05). In the malignant group, UbcH10 percentages and scores were only 
significantly related to age. There was no significant association between UbcH10
expression and tumor grade and stage. Overexpression of UbcH10 may be a useful
indicator of endometrial carcinoma. UbcH10 also deserves further evaluation in
the detection of prognostic mean and also for its role in endometrial
carcinogenesis.

Breast masses are very rare in infants and premature telarche due to excessive
endogen or exogenous estrogens is the most common presentation during infancy.
Myofibroblastoma is a stromal tumor of the breast, occurring especially in elder 
males. This breast mass has a close relationship between androgen receptors and
has not been reported in infants previously. A 10-month old male baby with a left
breast mass, which is diagnosed as myofibroblastoma, is discussed to evaluate the
clinical features and treatment modalities of breast myofibroblastomas in
children.

We present a case of a woman who used topiramate (100 mg) and oxcarbazepine (300 
mg) continuously during pregnancy. Multiple fetal anomalies including limp
defects of the lower extremities, pericardiac fluid collection, cardiomegaly,
cleft lip and palate, absent right kidney, and dysplastic left kidney were found 
by ultrasonography. Labor was induced and anomalies were confirmed by autopsy.
The malformation rate after exposure to oxcarbazepine in utero as a monotherapy
was calculated to be 2.4%, which is compatible with the malformation rate seen in
the general population. Topiramate is teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits, but
there are very few reports about its teratogenicity in humans.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence and degree of preclinical
atherosclerosis in pups of pregnant rats exposed to cigarette smoke. Abdominal
aorta examined for atherosclerotic lesions and intimal medial thickness of the
abdominal aorta was measured by image analysis. The study groups showed
endothelial cellular losses, marked intimal injuries, elastic fiber damages,
mononuclear cellular infiltration, and irregularities in internal elastic
membrane, with pronounced damages as integrity losses and local fragmentations.
The results provide evidence for development of an atherosclerotic process in the
neonatal period, even in prenatal stage, long before the formation of
smoke-related cardiovascular diseases.

Teratomas originating from the oral cavity are named as epignathus. It is a rare 
type of teratoma. An 11-day old male newborn was diagnosed with cleft palate and 
intraoral masses. The mass on the right side was protruding from the mouth.
Another one on the left side was extending from the nasopharynx to the
oropharynx. The diagnosis of mature teratoma was made based on the
histopathological study of surgically excised masses. We desired to report on
this case since multiple localized epignatus in a newborn with cleft palate has
not been described yet in the literature.

A male infant was born to a 24-year-old mother (gravida 1 para 1) by cesarean
delivery at 33 1/7 weeks of gestation. The physical examination revealed a large 
mass protruding from the baby's mouth, which appeared to be attached to the
palate. Tracheostomy was performed immediately in the delivery room. A partial
surgical excision was performed on the second postnatal day, removing most of the
teratoma (epignathus), which was attached to the back of the pharynx and
protruding from the baby's mouth measuring 13×11×9 cm and weighing 545 g. The
final pathological diagnosis was "malignant epignathus with nephroblastoma
component." According to our knowledge, this is the first case that have
malignant epignathus including nephroblastoma component in the literature.

University, Istanbul, Turkey. fpekiner@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Our purpose is to study cytotoxic T-cell activation (through
evaluation of CD8+CD40+ and CD8+CD154+ cells), chemokine receptors (through
evaluation of CD8+CD184+ and CD8+CD195+ cells), and adhesion molecules (through
evaluation of CD8+CD152+ cells) which play a part in cell activation in blood and
serum samples of patients with OLP and then to compare them with healthy
controls.
METHODS: Thirty patients with OLP, and 30 matched healthy controls participated. 
The mean ages of OLP patients and controls were 51,10 ± 12,25 and 48,09 ± 11,92, 
respectively. Percentage of apoptotic cells, granzyme-B+, CD8+, CD8+CD40+,
CD8+CD152+ (CTLA-4), CD8+CD154+(CD40L), CD8+CD184+(CXCR-4) and CD8+CD195+(CCR-5) 
were detected by immunophenotyping on flow cytometry. Apoptosis measurements were
accomplished with Annexin V/Propidium Iodide kit.
RESULTS: A higher percentage of CD8+CD154+ and granzyme-B+ and a lower percentage
of CD8+, CD8+CD184+ and apoptotic cells were found in OLP patients than in
controls. No statistical differences were observed in the percentages of the
other markers between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: It is observed that because of increase in granzyme B+ and CD154
which is the activation marker, CD8+ cells present efforts to sustain their
activity even though decrease in their cell number. Lower levels of CD8+CD184+
cells in OLP than control is evaluated as a factor that makes OLP to be localised
in our study. In addition, our findings lead us to think that there may be some
changes in apoptosis pathways of the cells. But this needs to be clarified by
further studies exploring the mechanisms of the apoptosis in OLP patients.

Recent studies have shown that whey protein has many useful effects including its
anti-cancer effect. In this study we have compared the protective effect of
dietary whey protein with whey protein hydrolyzate against azoxymethane and
dextran sodium sulfate induced colon cancer in rats. We used a rat model of the
colon cancer induced by administration of azoxymethane followed by repeated
dextran sodium sulfate ingestion which causes multiple tumor development. Colon
tissues were analyzed histologically in addition to biochemical analyses
performed by measuring lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and glutathione
levels in both of colon and liver tissues of rats after sacrification.
Macroscopic and microscopic tumors were identified in all groups that received
azoxymethane followed by repeated dextran sodium sulfate. Group fed with whey
protein hydrolyzate showed significantly less macroscopic and microscopic tumor
development compared with group fed with whey protein. The protocol applied to
generate an appropriate model of colon cancer was successful. Whey protein
hydrolyzate was found to be more effective in preventing colon tumor development 
compared with whey protein.

It has been reported previously that: (1) normal-breast epithelial cells that are
CD24-/44+ express higher levels of stem/progenitor cell-associated genes; (2)
cancer cells that have undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition display
CD24-/44+ cell-surface expression, a marker for breast cancer stem cells; (3)
loss of E-cadherin is a preliminary step in epithelial to mesenchymal transition;
and (4) vimentin is a marker of mesenchymal phenotype. We hypothesized that stem 
cell subpopulations would be more frequent in metastatic than in primary tumors. 
Therefore we assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, tissue microarrays
containing tissue from primary and associated metastatic breast cancers for
expression of CD24, CD44, E-cadherin and vimentin to evaluate candidate
cancer-initiating cell populations in breast cancer subtypes and metastatic
lesions. The occurrence of CD24-/44+ and CD24+/44- cells did not differ in
primary vs matched lymph node or distant and locoregional metastatic lesions;
E-cadherin expression was decreased in primary vs lymph node metastases (P=0.018)
but not decreased in distant and locoregional metastases relative to primary
tumor, whereas vimentin, was more frequently expressed in lymph node and distant 
and locoregional metastases (P=0.013, P=0.004) than in matched primary cancers.
Thus, the frequency of CD24-/44+ cells does not differ in metastases relative to 
the primary breast cancer but differs by tumor stage and subtype.

Mixed cryoglobulinemia is commonly related to chronic HCV infection, and renal
complications occur frequently. Typical renal involvement presents with diffuse
proliferative glomerular pathology, similar to membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis, with necrotizing arteritis of medium-sized vessels, referred 
to as cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. However, the histological appearance
may vary according to the clinical presentation and treatment applied. Not only
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis but also certain types of systemic
vasculitis (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Polyarteritis Nodosa), thrombotic
microangiopathy, and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia may exhibit similar
histopathological findings in the biopsy with cryoglobulinemic
glomerulonephritis. For an optimal differential diagnosis, clinicopathological
correlation and serological findings should accompany the pathological findings. 
We present a case of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, and discuss the
differential diagnosis in detail.

BACKGROUND: 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is commonly used as a marker to
evaluate oxidative DNA damage in disorders including chronic inflammatory
diseases such as inflammatory periodontal pathologies. In the current study we
hypothesized that the level of 8-OHdG in saliva increases by the periodontal
destruction severity determined by clinical parameters as clinical attachment
level (CAL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sum of 60 age
gender balanced; chronic periodontitis (CP) (n=20), chronic gingivitis (CG)
(n=20) and healthy (H) (n=20) individuals. Clinical periodontal parameters and
salivary 8-OHdG levels were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean 8-OHdG level in the saliva of the CP group was significantly
higher than H and CG groups (p< 0.001). Statistically significant correlation was
only observed between the salivary levels of 8-OHdG and age (p< 0.05), probing
depth (PD) and CAL (p< 0.001) in CP group. However, when CP patients were
classified according to their CAL levels (CAL⩾ 3 mm (n=11) and CAL<3 mm (n=9))
statistically significant correlation was only observed between the salivary
levels of 8-OHdG and CAL ⩾ 3 mm patients (p< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: We suggest that elevated salivary levels of 8-OHdG may be a marker
for disease activity and it may reflect indirectly disease severity parameters
such as CAL.

Toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a review of melatonin and
diclofenac sodium association.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for the purpose of 
anti-inflammation, antipyretic, and analgesia. For this aim, they are used for
the alleviation of pain, fever, and inflammation associated with rheumatoid
arthritis, sports injuries, and temporary pain. However, treatment with NSAIDs
may be accompanied by adverse effects such as gastrointestinal damage and
platelet dysfunction. As with the other NSAIDs, diclofenac sodium
(sodium-(o-((2,6-dichlorophenyl)-amino)-phenyl)-acetate) (DS), an NSAID, has
potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. However, treatment 
with DS may cause some adverse cerebral and cerebellar effects such as
convulsions, disorientation, hallucination, and loss of consciousness. Melatonin 
(MLT) is a free-radical scavenger and possesses antioxidant properties. It has
been reported to easily cross the blood-brain barrier, and is found in high
concentrations in the brain after exogenous administration. It is also a
neuroprotector in a wide range of conditions affecting the central nervous system
CNS due to its free-radical scavenging activities and lipophilic-hydrophilic
properties. Neuroprotective actions of MLT have been discovered in both in vitro 
and in vivo, and are a powerful scavenger of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals.
Thus, MLT can protect the cell membrane, organelles, and core against
free-radical damage. Therefore, it has been postulated that exogenous MLT acts as
a neuroprotector contrary to DS neurotoxicity. In this review, we aimed to
discuss the possible neuroprotective effects of MLT on DS toxicity.

Metaplastic carcinoma (MC) of the breast, consisting of epithelial and mixed
epithelial-mesenchymal tumors, are extremely rare human neoplasms. They are
mostly detected between the 5th and 7th decade and have an unfavorable prognosis.
Therefore, it is of utmost important to find out the behavior and also the
immunohistochemical (IHC) profile of these tumors. In the current study, the aim 
was to examine 6 cases of MC with detailed clinico-pathological variables of
cancer, follow-up and IHC profile of several antigens. The following
immunohistochemical markers were used: MNF116, vimentin, CD10, smooth muscle
actin (SMA), estrogen/progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu. The mean age was 39.1
the mean size was 3.3 cm. 83% of the cases had spindle cell sarcoma-like areas.
Two of six cases also had a chondrosarcoma-like component. The epithelial
component was invasive ductal carcinoma in all. MNF116, vimentin, CD10, and SMA
expressions were as follows: mesenchymal cells: 33%, 100%, 50%, 83%, epithelial
cells: 100%, 50%, 33%, 0%. All were triple negative. 66.6% presented with the
axillary lymph node metastases. The mean follow-up period was 51 months, 50% died
of the disease. Two had distant metastases to the lung. Our series which only
included mixed epithelial-mesenchymal type metaplastic carcinoma of the breast
showed myoepithelial differentiation with a worse prognosis.

The objective of this study was to investigate nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM) expression
in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and renal oncocytomas. The expression of NPM was
studied by immunohistochemical methods on 59 RCCs, 9 oncocytomas, and 19
tumour-negative renal tissues. The expression was assessed relative to various
clinicopathological variables and histological subtypes, to determine its
potential role as a prognostic and diagnostic marker. All tumours showed nuclear 
staining, and a minority also exhibited cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Two
patterns of nuclear staining were observed: nuclear staining with a prominent
nucleolus (nucleolar staining) and nuclear staining without a prominent
nucleolus. There were significant differences, in both nuclear staining and
cytoplasmic NPM expression, between oncocytomas and chromophobe RCCs (p < 0.001) 
and clear cell RCCs (p < 0.001). Cytoplasmic NPM expression was markedly lower in
RCCs than in oncocytomas. A statistically significant correlation was discovered 
between nucleolar staining and nuclear grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.5). No
relationship was found between cytoplasmic expression of NPM and any of the
clinicopathological parameters or survival. NPM might be a useful
immunohistochemical marker for differential diagnosis between oncocytoma and
chromophobe RCC. In addition, increased nucleolar NPM expression in RCCs appears 
to be associated with tumour progression.

Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a well-established prognostic marker in breast
cancer. The role of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in breast cancers is still under
investigation. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance and
immunohistochemical expression patterns of ERα, total ERβ (ERβ) and its spliced
variant ERβcx in normal breast, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive
ductal carcinoma (IDC). Our study population comprised 10 normal breasts, 26
DCISs and 44 IDCs. Immunohistochemical expression of these markers was
investigated in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks by 2
observers. In invasive ductal carcinomas, ERβ expression had a significant
positive correlation with ERα expression (p=0.013), while ERβcx expression was
significantly associated with the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.046). 
There was a significant relationship between ERα expression and low histological 
grade (p<0.0001). Similarly, ERα+/ERβ+ tumors (p=0.004) and ERα+/ERβcx+ tumors
(p=0.008) were significantly associated with low histological grade, too. ERα
expression (p=0.009), ERβcx expression (p=0.048) and ERα+/ERβ+ coexpression
(p=0.002) increased significantly in progression from normal breast to invasive
ductal carcinoma. Expression of ERα correlates with less aggressive phenotypic
features, and ERβ expression is positively correlated with ERα expression in
breast cancer. ERβcx is associated with aggressive features and can take part in 
the progression of invasive carcinoma. Increase in ERα+/ERβ+ coexpression, ERα
expression and ERβcx expression in breast cancer progression indicates an
enhancement in ER expressions or an alteration in expression patterns of
different ER variants during mammary carcinogenesis.

Alcoholism is a complex genetically influenced disorder which refers to alcohol
abuse and alcohol dependence. There are controversial results on the role of gene
polymorphisms in alcohol dependence in the literature. Differences in population 
groups and selective inclusion criteria for alcohol dependence may affect
results. In this study, we investigated the role of ADH1B Arg48His (rs1229984)
and, ADH1C Ile350Val (rs698) gene polymorphisms in Turkish population. 100
healthy volunteers and 75 patients who were admitted to Ege University Alcohol
Dependence Unit enrolled in the study. We found significant increase both in
ADH1B (Arg48His) polymorphism Arg allele and Arg/Arg genotype frequency in
patients. No profound connection between alcohol dependence and ADH1C Ile350Val
gene polymorphism was detected. Alcohol dependence is an important health problem
that depends on many genetic and environmental factors but we think that it is
possible to interpret genetic risk for developing early diagnostic methods and
treatment strategies by comprehensive linkage and association studies.

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) applies specific diagnostic criteria 
to designate a monoclonal endometrial preinvasive glandular proliferation known
from previous studies to confer a 45-fold increased risk for endometrial cancer. 
In this international study we estimate accuracy and precision of EIN diagnosis
among 20 reviewing pathologists in different practice environments, and with
differing levels of experience and training. Sixty-two endometrial biopsies
diagnosed as benign, EIN, or adenocarcinoma by consensus of two expert
subspecialty pathologists were used as a reference comparison to assess
diagnostic accuracy of 20 reviewing pathologists. Interobserver reproducibility
among the 20 reviewers provided a measure of diagnostic precision. Before
evaluating cases, observers were self-trained by reviewing published textbook
and/or online EIN diagnostic guidelines. Demographics of the reviewing
pathologists, and their impressions regarding implementation of EIN terminology
were recorded. Seventy-nine percent of the 20 reviewing pathologists' diagnoses
were exactly concordant with the expert consensus (accuracy). The interobserver
weighted κ values of 3-class EIN scheme (benign, EIN, carcinoma) diagnoses
between expert consensus and each of reviewing pathologists averaged 0.72
(reproducibility, or precision). Reviewing pathologists demonstrated one of three
diagnostic styles, which varied in the repertoire of diagnoses commonly used, and
their nonrandom response to potentially confounding diagnostic features such as
endometrial polyp, altered differentiation, background hormonal effects, and
technically poor preparations. EIN diagnostic strategies can be learned and
implemented from standard teaching materials with a high degree of
reproducibility, but is impacted by the personal diagnostic style of each
pathologist in responding to potential diagnostic confounders.

The primary aim is to compare individuals with intestinal metaplasia (IM),
chronic active gastritis (CAG), and normal gastric mucosa (NGM) in terms of
apoptosis, proliferation, and Bcl-2 expression. The secondary aim is to determine
whether these parameters are different between patients with and without gastric 
cancer in first-degree relatives. We enrolled 106 patients whose
histopathological results were consistent with IM (n: 42), CAG (n: 51), or NGM
(n: 13). Antral biopsies were immunohistochemically stained for Bcl-2 and Ki-67
expression. Apoptosis was detected using TUNEL assay. While no significant
difference was determined between three groups with regard to apoptosis and Bcl-2
expression (p>0.05), Ki-67 expression was significantly higher in the IM group
when compared with the CAG and NGM groups (29.90±22.87 vs. 18.18±16.22 vs.
18.54±20, respectively; p=0.012). Helicobacter pylori was determined to increase 
apoptosis (49.3% vs. 25.7%, p<0.05), nevertheless, it had no significant effect
on proliferation and Bcl-2 expression. Bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression and apoptosis
were not different among patients with and without a history of gastric cancer in
first degree relatives. Although intestinal metaplasia cases demonstrate an
increase in proliferation, no elevation is observed in apoptosis. This can be an 
important factor in the progression to gastric cancer.

The value of CDX2 and cytokeratins 7 and 20 expression in differentiating
colorectal adenocarcinomas from extraintestinal gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas:
cytokeratin 7-/20+ phenotype is more specific than CDX2 antibody.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Metastatic adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary site is a
common clinical problem. Determining the cytokeratin (CK) 7/CK20 pattern of
tumors is one of the most helpful procedures for this purpose since the
CK7-/CK20+ pattern is typical of colorectal adenocarcinomas. CDX2, a critical
nuclear transcription factor for intestinal development, is expressed in
intestinal epithelium and adenocarcinomas. In the present study, we compared the 
sensitivity and specificity of CDX2 expression and the CK7-/CK20+ phenotype in
differentiating colorectal adenocarcinomas from pancreatic and gastric
adenocarcinomas.
METHODS: CK7/CK20 staining pattern and CDX2 expression were evaluated in 118
cases of colorectal, 59 cases of gastric, and 32 cases of pancreatic
adenocarcinomas. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive values of the CK7-/CK20+ phenotype and of CDX2 expression were
analyzed.
RESULTS: The CK7-/CK20+ immunophenotype was expressed by 75 of 118 (64%)
colorectal and 3 of 59 (5%) gastric tumors and was not observed in any pancreatic
adenocarcinomas. The CK7+/CK20+ immunophenotype was expressed in 24/118 (20%) of 
colon, 28/59 (48%) of gastric and 7/32 (22%) of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The
CK7+/CK20- expression pattern was observed in only 2% (2 of 118) of colorectal
carcinomas. CDX2 was expressed in 114 of 118 (97%) colorectal, 36 of 59 (61%)
gastric, and 5 of 32(16%) pancreatic adenocarcinomas. There was no significant
association between CDX2 expression and tumor differentiation in colorectal
carcinomas. In gastric carcinomas, CDX2 expression was more common in intestinal 
type tumors than in diffuse type carcinomas. The CK7-/CK20+ phenotype showed a
specificity of 96.7% in predicting colorectal adenocarcinomas, which was superior
to that of CDX2 expression. CDX2 expression at both cut-off levels (> 5% and >
50%) had a higher sensitivity (96.6% and 78%) than the CK phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the CK7-/CK20+ phenotype and expression of the antibody CDX2
are highly specific and sensitive markers of colorectal origin. CDX2 expression
should be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of intestinal adenocarcinomas,
particularly when better established markers such as CK7 and CK20 yield equivocal
results. The CK7-/CK20+ phenotype is superior in its specificity and positive
predictive value and might be preferred.

BACKGROUND: Systemic metastasis of a glial tumor is a rare event. However,
metastatic cases are anticipated to increase due to prolongation of survival as a
result of the development of new treatment modalities. The possibility of
metastasis should be considered in patients with a history of a glial tumor
rather than a second primary tumor. Fine-needle aspiration cytology is one of the
diagnostic procedures primarily applied for confirmation of metastasis in cases
with a known primary focus. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic
cytomorphologic findings is required in these cases.
CASE REPORT: We report a young woman with oligodendroglioma metastasizing to the 
cervical lymphatic chain 5 years after initial diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration 
cytology revealed a highly cellular smear with dispersed single cells and loosely
cohesive cell clusters showing rosette-like features on a clean background. The
relatively monotonous tumor cells were small sized and had round nuclei with
moderate anisonucleosis and scant cytoplasm without extensions. Diagnostic
confirmation was made by excisional biopsy and demonstration of 1p19q codeletion 
on tissue section by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
CONCLUSION: A brief review of the literature with an emphasis on the cytologic
features of metastatic oligodendroglioma and differential diagnosis with respect 
to other metastatic small round cell tumors is provided.

A 35-year-old woman presented with a thyroid mass, weakness and shortness of
breath of 3 years duration. On physical examination, she had a diffusely enlarged
thyroid gland with multiple nodules. There were no signs to suggest immune
suppression. The patient farmed and raised livestock. Biochemical tests and
hemogram were normal. She underwent surgery, and a histological examination of
the surgical specimen revealed nodular hyperplasia. Microscopically, silver
methenamine (PASM) stain-positive hyphae that divided into branches at 45° and
conidia were detected beside the thyroid capsule, with conidia in the cystic
nodule. Moreover, ischemic changes of the thyroid tissue were observed closer to 
the capsule. We report a case of Aspergillosis of the thyroid of a patient who
underwent surgery for a multinodular goiter.

Turkey. seminayhan@gmail.com

The diagnosis of synchronous prostatic and rectal carcinomas is uncommon. To make
a correct diagnosis, biopsies of both sites are mandatory. Pathological slides
should be compared and immunohistochemical staining should be taken into
consideration. In this paper, an unexpected case of synchronous rectal and
prostatic carcinomas arising in an 84-year-old male with hematemesis and pelvic
pain is reported. These two tumoral components have a distinctive histological
appearance. Immunohistochemical evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of these
synchronous tumors. This case emphasizes that rectal and prostatic carcinomas can
arise simultaneously. In this situation, providing clinicopathological
correlation and deciding the necessity of intraoperative consultation in proper
time are extremely important.

University, Medical Faculty, Sanliurfa, Turkey. suda_tekinkoruk@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the mast cell (MC)
concentration in the liver tissue of patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C 
and to determine whether there was a correlation with clinical and pathological
characteristics of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on liver biopsy samples from 60
patients with chronic hepatitis C. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained
from follow-up records. Stained liver biopsies were examined. Immunohistochemical
staining was performed by using an anti-c-kit antibody. Patients were divided
into four groups (minimal, mild, moderate, and severe) based on the intensity of 
inflammation and their hepatic activity index scores and into two groups
(no-mild, moderate-severe) according to fibrosis grade.
RESULTS: Among patients enrolled, 60.0% (n=36) were men with a mean age of 48.3 ±
12.7 (range 18-64) years. The mean number of mast cells per portal area in the
liver was 0.87 ± 0.86 (0-4.0). No correlation was found between alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Ribonucleic acid ( RNA )
levels and the degree of inflammation of cases with number of mast cells and
liver steatosis (P>0.05). As the degree of fibrosis increased in the liver so did
the number of mast cells in portal areas (P=0.001). On the other hand, no
correlation was found between the degree of fibrosis and the number of MCs in the
sinusoids and steatosis (P<0.05). The increase in the number of MCs in the portal
areas correlated with an increase in liver steatosis (t: 0.02, P=0.04).
CONCLUSION: In light of these findings, it appears possible that MC accumulation 
in chronic HCV patients may be used as an indicator of fibrosis and possibly be
considered in the follow-up of these patients.

Turkey.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate gingival crevicular fluid
(GCF) calprotectin, osteocalcin and cross-linked N-terminal telopeptide (NTx)
levels in health along with different periodontal diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty chronic periodontitis (CP), 20 generalized
aggressive periodontitis (G-AgP), 20 gingivitis and 20 healthy subjects were
included. Probing depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index and papillary
bleeding index was recorded. GCF calprotectin, osteocalcin and NTx levels were
analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: CP, G-AgP and gingivitis groups had higher GCF calprotectin total amount
compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.008). CP and G-AgP groups had similar, but
higher levels compared to gingivitis groups (p< 0.008). CP and G-AgP groups had
lower GCF osteocalcin total amount compared to gingivitis and healthy groups (p< 
0.008). CP group had higher GCF NTx but lower osteocalcin total amount and
osteocalcin/NTx ratio than the G-AgP group (p< 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that elevated GCF calprotectin levels play a
role as a reliable inflammatory marker in the pathogenesis of periodontal
disease. Fluctuating GCF levels of osteocalcin and NTx might point out to the
abnormal bone turnover in periodontitis. Our data document for the first time the
role of NTx in the pathogenesis of different periodontal diseases.

Basal cell adenoma (BCA) is a rare benign basaloid neoplasm of the salivary
gland. There are four histopathological types of BCA: solid, tubular, trabecular,
and membranous. It is known that focal squamous metaplasia may be seen in some
BCAs, but it is rare to see extensive squamous metaplasia, especially with
cellular atypia. Here, a 25-year-old male with right parotid swelling is
presented. Ultrasonography revealed a 2-cm well defined mass in his parotid
gland. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA), performed prior to surgical excision, showed
a highly cellular tumor composed of basaloid cells, forming small duct-like or
tubular structures containing basement membrane-like material, as well as
squamous cells with hyperchromatic, enlarged, pleomorphic, and bizzare nuclei. We
made a cytopathological diagnosis of "basaloid neoplasm" and also reported that
the differential diagnosis included BCA, cellular pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell
adenocarcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. The patient underwent total
parotidectomy. Both frozen and permanent sections showed a BCA with membranous,
tubulotrabecular pattern, and extensive squamous metaplasia. Some of the squamous
cells showed significant nuclear hyperchromasia, enlargement, and pleomorphism.
As far as we know, this is the first case of BCA with extensive squamous
metaplasia and prominent cellular atypia. This case has been presented to show
that squamous metaplastic cells with hyperchromatic, enlarged, bizarre, and
pleomorphic nuclei can be seen on FNA smears of a benign tumor like BCA. Also,
the differential diagnosis of BCA of the salivary gland is discussed here.

Hepatoportal sclerosis (HPS) is a syndrome of obscure etiology, and is one of the
causes of noncirrhotic portal hypertension (PH). We aimed to investigate this
heterogeneous group of patients whose presentation showed cholestatic features,
histopathologically. Between 1999 and 2009, 12 children diagnosed with HPS were
retrospectively evaluated. HPS was diagnosed with evidence of PH, noncirrhotic
liver biopsy with typical histopathologic findings, and exclusion of other
possible causes of PH. The data was obtained from pathology reports and
microscopic slides. In histopathological re-evaluation fibrosis state, aberrant
portal vessels, portal tract dilation and inflammation, ductular reaction,
regenerative nodular hyperplasia, acinar transformation, presence of bile
pigment, and cholangitis were noted. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and albumin
levels, presentation patterns, and radiologic findings were assessed. Familial
relationship degrees were also investigated. Twelve patients (9 boys, 3 girls;
3-180 months) were re-evaluated. Two pairs of the patients were siblings. Parents
of 7 patients were consanguine. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal 
distension. Histopathologically, all patients had hepatoportal sclerosis/intimal 
fibrous thickening of portal vein and periportal fibrosis, acinar transformation,
and regenerative nodules not surrounded by fibrous septae. Eight patients had
vascular aberrations, 7 had ductular reaction, 1 showed mild cholangitis, and 1
had canalicular bile pigment. We conclude that genetic predisposition might be a 
possible factor for HPS development in Turkish patients and it should be kept in 
mind that cholestatic features noticed in histopathological evaluation may
represent a variant group in the spectrum of HPS.

Forensic identification techniques include the examination of ID cards, the
decedent's private belongings, fingerprints, footprints, lip marks, dental
findings, red blood cell enzymes, performing photograph matching, facial
reconstruction, visual identification, and DNA "fingerprinting." As part of
forensic examinations, the identification of corpses that are fresh, decomposed, 
fragmented, or skeletonized as well as individual body parts and human remains
can be requested. Identification becomes a challenging task for forensic terms
particularly in mass-disaster situations. Each identification case should be
considered to its own merit and the way to do that should be based on the
effectiveness and cost of each method used. In Turkey, one of the major duties of
the medicolegal system on the investigation of deaths is to identify the deceased
if unknown.This study is undertaken to investigate the procedures, as well as
their validities, used to deal with individualization of dismembered bodies
directly sent to the Council of Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Justice, for
autopsy and/or visual identification, as well as those received from peripheral
districts for forensic identification. According to the Turkish Penal Procedural 
Law, a positive identification of the deceased is mandatory before performing an 
autopsy. According to the law, the ID cards are not taken to be sufficient for
recognition of the deceased, and the major way of identification in daily
practice is visual identification by a relative or any recognizant person to
approve the identification to the prosecutor. If visual identification fails,
fingerprints, dental x-rays or body x-rays, and DNA "fingerprinting" can be used 
to establish identity when compared with known records of the individual obtained
by law enforcement.This retrospective study was carried out into 421 dismembered 
bodies, among 3063 autopsies performed in year 2002 by the Department of Morgue
at the Council of Forensic Medicine, with particular insight into the
identification procedures undertaken and their results. The overall negative
identification rate was 30.4%, and in 1% of the cases, the visual identification 
by relatives were not confirmed by DNA identification and taken as misidentified.

Examination of epithelial tissue cytokine response to natural peste des petits
ruminants virus (PPRV) infection in sheep and goats by immunohistochemistry.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate expression of IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ and
iNOS in lingual, buccal mucosa and lung epithelial tissue using immunoperoxidase 
technique and to compare with the tissues of control animals. The tissues used in
the study were collected from 17 PPRV-affected and 5 healthy sheep and goats. In 
PPRV positive animals, the lungs, lingual and buccal mucosa had significantly
higher iNOS, IFN-γ and TNF-α expressions compared to control group animals. There
was no significant difference between PPRV positive and control groups for IL-4
and IL-10 expressions of epithelial tissues. In conclusion, the epithelial
tissues infected by PPRV showed significant iNOS, IFN-γ and TNF-α expressions and
they might play an important role in the initiation and regulation of cytokine
response, as they take place in the first host barrier to be in contact with
PPRV. It is suggested that the more epithelial damage produced by PPRV the more
cytokine response may result in the infected epithelial cells. The first
demonstration of iNOS expression and epithelial cytokine response to PPRV in
natural cases is important because it may contribute to an early initiation of
systemic immunity against PPRV infection, in addition to direct elimination of
the virus during the initial epithelial phase of the infection.

Cell cycle inhibitor p57 expression in normal and diabetic rat placentas during
some stages of pregnancy.

Acar N(1), Korgun ET, Ustunel I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Akdeniz
University, Antalya, Turkey.

Placentomegaly, an abnormal increase in the size of the placenta, is commonly
seen in human diabetic pregnancies and diabetic animal experimental models.
Proper placental development depends on the proliferation and differentiation of 
trophoblasts. However, our knowledge about the mitotic regulators that play key
roles in synchronizing these events is limited. p57 is a cyclin-dependent kinase 
(CDK) inhibitor acting in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. There is no data
regarding p57 expression in either rat or human diabetic placentas. The purpose
of this study was to investigate p57 expression in control and diabetic rat
placentas at different stages of pregnancy. Diabetes was induced by
streptozotocin on the first day of pregnancy, and placentas were taken on days
11, 13, 17, and 21 of pregnancy. Our results showed that on day 11, p57
immunostaining intensity was stronger in control group placentas compared to the 
diabetic group. On day 13, p57 immunostaining intensity increased in both groups,
but increased more in the diabetic group. On day 17, p57 immunostaining intensity
decreased in both the control and diabetic groups compared to day 13, yet the
intensity remained higher in control placentas compared to diabetic placentas. On
day 21 of pregnancy, p57 immunostaining intensity increased in the control group 
and it decreased from the day 17 level in the diabetic group. Western blot
results showed consistency with immunohistochemistry results. Our study shows
different expression patterns of p57 between control and diabetic rat placentas, 
which indicate p57 may play a role in abnormal placental formation resulting in
placentomegaly arising from diabetes.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma in a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosed
by calcitonin washout from a thyroid nodule.

Serum calcitonin is a tumor marker used in the diagnosis and follow-up of
medullary thyroid carcinoma. Calcitonin washout evaluation is a new method used
for suspicious thyroid nodules and lymph nodes. Limited clinical data are present
about the efficacy of this method. A 61-year-old female patient with known
Hashimoto's thyroditis and an 8-mm hypoechoic nodule was presented with one
previously benign fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). On referral to our
department, she had a moderately high-serum calcitonin level, and we repeated the
FNAC that was reported as nondiagnostic. We performed FNAC for the third time
together with calcitonin washout evaluation from the thyroid nodule. The FNAC was
again nondiagnostic, but the calcitonin washout level from the thyroid nodule was
152.569 pg/mL. Total thyroidectomy was performed, and the diagnosis was confirmed
as medullary thyroid carcinoma. Calcitonin washout evaluation may be a useful
method in the differential diagnosis of patients with thyroid nodules having
moderately high-serum calcitonin levels.

Could Riedel's thyroiditis be subacute thyroiditis? A case report.

Our purpose in this paper is to make a case for the need to question whether
Riedel's thyroiditis is in fact a rare variety of subacute thyroiditis. Total
thyroidectomy was performed on a patient with a huge thyroid mass. The
histopathological diagnosis was Riedel's thyroiditis with classical
lymphoplasmacytic infiltration destroying thyroid tissue and invading
perithyroidal soft tissue. However, in addition, histopathology showed
epithelioid granulomas containing multinuclear giant cells. The existence of
these giant cells led us to place this case somewhere between Hashimoto's
thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's). Since giant cells are seen 
in the histopathology of subacute thyroiditis, we propose that the possibility of
Riedel's thyroiditis being a form of subacute thyroiditis be observed and
studied.

Preeclampsia is a syndrome characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The aim
of this study is to find the relationship between preeclampsia, asymmetric
dimethyl arginine (ADMA), and the oxidant/antioxidant system. Twenty-one
preeclamptic and 28 normal pregnant women were included in this study. In cord
bloods, ADMA and oxidant/antioxidant parameters were measured. Asymmetric
dimethyl arginine levels were significantly increased in preeclamptic pregnancies
compared to the control group (p = 0.006). The activities of antioxidant enzymes 
and malondialdehyde levels were increased in the preeclamptic group compared to
the control group (p < 0.001, p = 0.022, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).
Development of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress may play a role in
developing preeclampsia.

Large duct type invasive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with microcystic and
papillary patterns: a potential microscopic mimic of non-invasive ductal
neoplasia.

Bagci P(1), Andea AA, Basturk O, Jang KT, Erbarut I, Adsay V.

Author information:

A morphological variant of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma forming large ductal 
elements, large duct type ductal adenocarcinoma, is documented and its
clinicopathological features are studied. These tumors may have microcystic and
papillary growth patterns that closely mimic the non-invasive cystic and
papillary pancreatic tumors such as: intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasia,
including the oncocytic variant, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and ducts involved by
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In a review of 230 pancreatectomy specimens
with ductal adenocarcinoma, 28 (8%) cases of large duct type ductal
adenocarcinomas were identified according to following criteria: more than 50% of
the tumor sections available for examination contained infiltrative ducts with a 
diameter larger than 0.5 mm or had a macroscopically identifiable microcystic
pattern. Overall characteristics of large duct type ductal adenocarcinomas were
not too different than those of conventional ductal adenocarcinomas, except that 
there was a slight female predominance in the former (F/M=2.3). The mean age was 
67 (vs 63 in conventional ductal adenocarcinomas; P=0.015), and occurrence in the
tail was slightly more common (40% vs 18% in conventional ductal adenocarcinomas;
P=0.006). Grossly, cysts measuring up to 1 cm was noted in 10 cases.
Microscopically, large duct type adenocarcinomas were characterized by
irregularly distributed large ducts with jagged edges, lined by columnar mucinous
cells often having deceptively bland cytological features and variable degrees of
papillomatosis. Stromal desmoplasia had a hypercellular quality (morphologically 
distinct from ovarian-like stroma) in four cases, and had a myxoid quality in
others. KRAS oncogene mutation was identified in 9 out of 11 cases. Median,
1-year and 2-year survival rates were 16 months, 77% and 30%, respectively, as
opposed to 12 months, 52% and 30%, respectively, in conventional ductal
adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, it should be recognized that, some (8%) pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas exhibit a large duct pattern that may microscopically
mimic non-invasive pancreatic tumors characterized by cystic and papillary
patterns. They may be distinguished by the relatively smaller size of the cysts, 
irregularity of the duct contours, clustering of the ducts, presence of
intraluminal neutrophils and granular debris, degree of cytological pleomorphism,
and myxoid quality of the stroma. Clinical behavior appears to be slightly better
than that of conventional ductal adenocarcinoma, which may be accounted by the
well-differentiated nature of these tumors.

Serum progranulin as an independent marker of liver fibrosis in patients with
biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

BACKGROUND: Elevated progranulin levels are associated with visceral obesity,
elevated plasma glucose, and dyslipidemia. Progranulin has not been previously
investigated as a biomarker of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We
sought to determine whether serum progranulin levels are altered in patients with
biopsy-proven NAFLD and if they are associated with their clinical, biochemical, 
and histological characteristics.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We measured serum progranulin levels in 95 patients with
biopsy-proven NAFLD and 80 age- and sex-matched controls. The potential
associations between progranulin and the characteristics of NAFLD patients were
examined by multiple linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Serum progranulin levels were significantly higher in NAFLD patients (34
± 13 ng/mL) than in controls (28 ± 7 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In NAFLD patients, serum 
progranulin levels were associated with lipid levels and the degree of hepatic
fibrosis. After adjustment for potential confounders, serum progranulin remained 
an independent predictor of the degree of hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD patients (β =
0.392; t = 2.226, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, NAFLD patients have higher serum progranulin
concentrations, which are closely associated with lipid values and the extent of 
hepatic fibrosis.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression in invasive ductal
carcinoma of the breast.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 are gelatinases that play a role in 
the invasion and metastasis of cancer through the destruction of the basal
membrane and extracellular matrix. In this study, we investigated the
immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the correlation between the
expression levels and prognostic clinicopathological parameters in 140 patients
with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The staining scores for MMP-9 were negative
in 21 cases (15%), mild in 27 cases (19%), and strong in 92 cases (66%). MMP-9
expression was increased in high-grade (p=0.001), triple-negative (ER, PR, HER2
negative) (p=0.006), and ER-negative tumors (p=0.004) and tumors with distant
metastases (p=0.028). MMP-9 expression was increased in cases with HER2
over-expression/amplification, but no statistically significant difference was
found (p=0.215). No correlation was found between lymph node metastasis or tumor 
size and MMP-9 expression (p=0.492 and p=0.448, respectively). The staining
scores for MMP-2 in 140 cases were negative in 10 cases (7%), mild in 25 cases
(18%), and strong in 105 cases (75%). MMP-2 expression was increased in
ER-negative and high-grade tumors in the lymph node-negative group (p=0.025 and
0.026, respectively). High MMP-9 expression was associated with a shorter
disease-free survival and overall survival times (p=0.042 and p=0.046,
respectively). In conclusion, increased MMP-9 expression is related to poor
prognostic clinicopathological factors in IDC, and hence, it can be utilized as a
supplementary prognostic marker. The role of MMP-2 expression in the prognosis of
IDC is rather limited.

This study aims to investigate the relation of mast cell (MC) accumulation with
tumor grade and stage in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder and to
determine its relationship with angiogenesis. A total of 78 urothelial carcinomas
obtained by transurethral resection were investigated immunohistochemically by
using c-Kit (CD117) and anti-CD34. The correlation between MC counts and
microvessels was evaluated and compared with histopathologic parameters including
tumor stage and grade. There were significant correlations between MC counts,
grade, and stage (P < .05; r = 0.69 and 0.63, respectively). However, MC counts
in adjacent nontumoral bladder mucosa significantly were higher than the MC
counts in tumoral zone (P < .001). On the other hand, significant correlation was
found between the number of MCs in tumoral zone and the microvessel density (P < 
.05, r = 0.56). The results of our study suggest that c-Kit positive MCs in
tumoral zone may contribute to tumor angiogenesis and play a significant role in 
tumor growth and invasion. Further studies are needed to support these
observations.

Pituitary macroadenoma with persisting dense lymphocytic infiltration in a young 
male patient.

Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical
Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.

CONTEXT: Lymphocytic anterior hypophysitis in association with a pituitary
adenoma was reported previously. In rare instance, inflammatory infiltration was 
confined to adenoma tissue itself, excluding anterior pituitary.
CASE: The patient - a 27-year-old male - presented with visual field defect.
Further examination revealed a pituitary mass with suprasellar extension.
Hormonal evaluation indicated mild hyperprolactinemia (42 ng/ml, normal < 19).
After transsphenoidal resection, a pituitary adenoma showing cytoplasmic
immunoreactivity to prolactin was identified. Dense and diffuse lymphocytic
infiltration was seen within the tumor. At 15th month, a second transsphenoidal
operation was necessary because of rapid development of visual compromise and
headache. Excised surgical specimen consistent with previously resected adenoma
showed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration composed of B and T cells within the
adenoma tissue again.
CONCLUSION: Presence of dense, hypophysitis-like lymphocytic infiltration within 
pituitary adenoma tissue obtained by two consecutive operations may reflect an
host-mediated immune reaction to tumor. This rare finding could be challenging in
terms of differential diagnosis and follow-up course.

Most lymphomas arising in the ovary are diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt
lymphomas. Follicular lymphomas of the ovary are rare, and their
clinicopathologic features are incompletely understood. We investigated clinical,
morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of follicular lymphomas
initially diagnosed in the ovary in 16 women. We performed immunohistochemistry
for CD20, CD3, CD10, BCL6, IRF4/MUM1, and BCL2 and interphase fluorescence in
situ hybridization for translocations involving BCL2, BCL6, and IRF4. Clustering 
was performed on the basis of clinicopathologic and genetic variables using
Cluster 3.0. Ages ranged from 42 to 73 years. Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering analysis revealed 2 distinct groups of patients. One group (group A)
included 7 cases, which were negative or weakly positive for BCL2 protein and
lacked IGH@/BCL2 translocations (6 cases evaluable). Four patients were of grade 
3A, and 3 patients were of grade 2. Four had stage IE disease with unilateral
ovarian involvement (subgroup A(1)), and the stage was unknown in 3 patients
(subgroup A(2)). The second group (group B) included 9 cases of low histologic
grade, which strongly expressed BCL2 protein and had IGH@/BCL2 translocations (7 
cases evaluable). Six patients had stage III/IV disease, 2 had stage II disease, 
and the stage was unknown in 1 patient. Although follow-up intervals were
limited, patients with higher-grade/low-stage disease tended to have favorable
outcomes. These data indicate 2 distinct types of follicular lymphomas presenting
in the ovary: a low-grade/high-stage/BCL2-positive group and a
higher-grade/low-stage/BCL2-negative group. This latter group likely has distinct
biological and immunologic characteristics, as has been suggested for
higher-grade/low-stage follicular lymphomas presenting at other extranodal sites.

Classification of a uterine smooth muscle neoplasm as benign or malignant is
straightforward in most of the cases. During pregnancy, hemorrhage, necrosis and 
various degenerative changes can complicate the diagnosis. In this study, we
examined the histological features, clinical behavior and proliferatively related
markers in gestational leiomyomas removed during cesarean section. From 2005 to
2008, 53 pregnant patients with leiomyomas were submitted to cesarean section in 
our institute. Degenerative and atypical changes were detected in 42 leiomyomas
(61.7%). Seven leiomyomas had extensive areas of necrosis. All necrotic foci
appeared in the form of hyaline type or infarct type necrosis. Cellular atypia
was mild and focal in 18 leiomyomas. Atypia was associated with hyaline type
necrosis in 3 cases. Mitotic activity was very low (<5/10 HPF) in one but all of 
the cases. Within a median follow-up of 38 months, none of the patients in our
study with follow-up information had any evidence of residual disease or
recurrence. Morphological features of leiomyomas removed during pregnancy include
extensive hyalin type necrosis, hemorrhage and focal cellular atypia. The
pathological management of gestational uterine leiomyomas may be performed
successfully with a multivariate diagnostic approach. The proper clinical
management of leiomyomas needs further studies to clarify the etiology and
pathogenesis of this common disease.

PAX2 and PAX8 are transcription factors that are essential in embryonic
development of müllerian organs. They may also play a role in tumor development
in these organs. The diagnostic utility of PAX2 and PAX8 relative to one another 
has not been comprehensively studied. Archival tissue samples for normal or
non-neoplastic tissue (251), primary epithelial neoplasms (316 for PAX2 and 357
for PAX8), and metastatic epithelial neoplasms (16), all of müllerian origin,
were subjected to PAX2 and PAX8 immunostaining. The staining frequency, extent,
and intensity for these markers were compared. Virtually identical PAX2 and PAX8 
expressions were noted in non-neoplastic tissue. They were constantly seen in
most epithelial cells (but not in stromal cells) of the endocervix, endometrium, 
fallopian tube, paratubal cyst, endosalpingiosis, endometriosis, and endometrial 
polyp. Within the primary epithelial neoplasms, PAX2 and PAX8 expression was
noted in 55% and 98% of serous tumors, 25% and 94% of endometrioid tumors, 19%
and 100% of clear cell tumors, 11% and 67% of transitional/undifferentiated
tumors, and 10% and 22% of mucinous tumors, respectively. Regardless of
histologic subtypes, PAX2 staining was noted in fewer cells and with less
staining intensity compared with PAX8. No tumor showed only PAX2 staining. Within
the metastatic carcinomas, PAX2 and PAX8 expression was noted in 38% and 98% of
cases, respectively, with a diffuse and strong staining for PAX8, contrasting
with a patchy and weak PAX2 expression. PAX2 and PAX8 are constantly expressed in
normal or non-neoplastic tissue of müllerian origin. For primary and metastatic
müllerian epithelial tumors, PAX8 shows strong and diffuse staining in most cases
of all histologic subtypes, except in mucinous tumors. In contrast, PAX2
expression is always less than PAX8, and exclusive staining for PAX2 is not seen.
PAX8 supersedes PAX2 as probably the best epithelial marker hitherto for primary 
or metastatic müllerian epithelial tumors.

In diabetes, cells and tissues are damaged due to the imbalance between
production of free radicals and removal of them. The effective biologic
antioxidants for oxidative stress such as α-lipoic acid, vitamin E and selenium
are effective in diminishing oxidative damage such as membrane lipid
peroxidation. The experiment aimed to investigate the oxidative stress occurring 
in mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fraction of pancreatic tissues in
streptozotocin-diabetic mice and the possible effects of α-lipoic acid + vitamin 
E + selenium combination on oxidative damage and antioxidative system by using
microscopic and biochemical methods. The mice were divided into five groups.
These groups were treated by citrate buffer, the solvents of the antioxidants,
combined the antioxidants [α-lipoic acid (50 mg/kg), vitamin E (100 mg/kg),
selenium (0.25 mg/kg)], streptozotocin (40 mg/kg × 5), combined the antioxidants 
and streptozotocin. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. In the
experimental group given combined antioxidants following results were observed
compared to diabetic group: increased percent insulin-positive cell area;
decreased blood glucose levels; increased manganase superoxide dismutase
activities and unsignificantly increased superoxide dismutase activities;
unsignificantly decreased lipid peroxidase levels in both of fraction;
unsignificantly decreased in mitochondrial fraction and unsignificantly increased
in cytosolic fraction for catalase levels; not any alteration glutathione levels;
not any activity in both of fraction for glutathione peroxidase. We can say that 
by taking the blood glucose levels and immunohistochemical results into account, 
the combination of triple antioxidants has a partly positive effect on diabetes. 
This positive effect could increase when trying different doses of combined
antioxidant treatment.

BACKGROUND: Crossed aphasia is a rare phenomenon, with a prevalence of 1% to 2%
among all right-handed patients. Two crossed aphasic patients with a nonfluent
variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) have been reported previously. This 
report aims to document for the first time the occurrence of crossed logopenic
progressive aphasia in a dextral patient.
CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old monolingual housewife presented with word-finding
difficulties. She was strongly right handed, had no clinical history for brain
damage to the left hemisphere, and no left handers in her family history. Her
language comprised simple, grammatically correct sentences with a fluctuating
speech rate and intermittent word-finding pauses. Rare phonological errors were
noted. Sentence repetition tasks showed impairments with grammatically complex
sentences. Comprehension was intact as were writing and reading. The language
disability remained isolated for 3 years. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging
depicted somewhat asymmetrical atrophy of the parietal lobes (R>L), whereas
single-photon-emitted computed tomographic imaging demonstrated hypoperfusion in 
the right parietal cortex, indicating right hemisphere dominance for language.
CONCLUSIONS: This case report provides evidence that crossed PPA can present with
a logopenic variant in addition to the nonfluent type demonstrated by others.
Functional neuroimaging showed unexpected right-sided hypoperfusion in this case 
with only subtle structural brain asymmetry, implicating a reverse pattern of
language dominance.

ETS-1 protein is one of the key regulators in tumor invasion and progression. We 
aimed to evaluate the role of ETS-1 in the invasiveness and progression of
laryngeal squamous carcinoma, as well as to determine the correlations between
clinicopathological characteristics and expression of this molecule. We assessed 
the levels of ETS-1 in a total of 96 laryngeal specimens of varying degrees of
dysplasia, microinvasive squamous carcinoma (8), and invasive squamous carcinoma 
(60), using normal mucosal epithelium (10) as a positive control. The
relationship between ETS-1 expression and clinicopathological parameters of
laryngeal carcinoma was also analyzed. We found a significantly higher ETS-1
expression in invasive laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas than in dysplasia
(P<0.001). A correlation between ETS-1 expression scores and grade was detected -
T factor, stage, cartilage invasion, lymph node metastasis, as well as depth of
invasion in laryngeal tumors. Our study is the first to demonstrate that ETS-1
expression is significantly increased in invasive carcinoma, but it is absent in 
low-moderate grade laryngeal dysplasia and non-neoplastic laryngeal mucosa. This 
data suggest that ETS-1 expression may play an important role in tumor invasion, 
and may function in the initiation of the invasive process in laryngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma.

Increased expression of COX-2 in recurrent basal cell carcinoma of the skin: a
pilot study.

INTRODUCTION: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent malignant skin
tumor. BCC rarely metastasizes, but it is often locally aggressive.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is critical for tumor formation, angiogenesis and
metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the members of the family of
zinc (Zn)- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases that degrade the extracellular
matrix.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, we used immunohistochemical methods for the 
evaluation of COX-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in tissue samples of 30 primary
and 10 recurrent skin BCC cases.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical COX-2 expression was significantly higher in the
infiltrating pattern of BCC compared with the nodular (P = 0.005) and superficial
(P = 0.041) subtypes in the primary BCC group. There was not a significant
difference between nodular and superficial BCCs for COX-2 expression. In
addition, COX-2 expression was significantly higher in the recurrent BCC group
than in the primary BCC group (P = 0.030). There was no statistically significant
difference between the histological subtypes of primary BCCs and between primary 
and recurrent BCCs for MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm previous findings that COX-2 and MMP-9 expressions 
are increased in BCC. Our results revealed an elevated COX-2 expression in
recurrent BCCs. We suggest that COX-2 inhibition might have beneficial effects in
BCCs, especially for the tumors with a higher level of COX-2 expression or
aggressive phenotype.

The enigmatic role of nucleophosmin in malignant melanoma: does it have an
effect?

BACKGROUND: Melanoma is quite a heterogeneous group of diseases of the skin.
Prognostic markers of tumor behavior are important to precisely assign individual
patients for appropriate treatment protocols.
AIM: The aim of our first study was to investigate nucleophosmin expression in
melanoma patients and to determine its relationship with the tumor
characteristics and patient prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of
nucleophosmin in 55 melanoma patients. The immunostaining pattern was classified 
into two groups: Diffuse nuclear and nucleolar relocalization. We also
investigated the relationship between the expression of nucleophosmin and the
clinicopathological parameters such as Clark level, tumor thickness, stage,
histological type, location, and survey.
RESULTS: In all cases the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for
nucleophosmin (14 cases diffuse nuclear, 41 cases nucleolar relocalization). No
correlation was demonstrated between the expression pattern of nucleophosmin and 
the clinicopathological parameters and survey.
CONCLUSIONS: The implications of our results, nevertheless, are that the
immunohistochemical detection of nucleophosmin is not a valuable tool for
predicting the outcome of patients with melanoma or identifying subgroups of
patients who may be at a higher risk.

Sok, Kirikkale, Turkey. ekupana@yahoo.com

Adenohibernoma of the breast is a very rare tumor composed of brown fat tissue
and intermingled glandular tissue. There are only 2 case reports in literature.
This study reports the third case of adenohibernoma of the breast, which is not
accompanied by breast cancer differing from the previous cases. And, to the best 
of the authors' knowledge, this is also the first case of adenohibernoma of the
breast that has demonstrated adipophilin expression immunohistochemically.

Trakya, Edirne, Turkey. mkanter65@yahoo.com

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Ginkgo biloba
(EGb 761) on testicular torsion/detorsion induced ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)
injury. A total of 24 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups:
control, I/R and I/R treated with EGb 761; each group contains 8 animals.
Testicular torsion was created by rotating the left testis 720° in a clockwise
direction. The ischemia period was 5 h and orchiectomy was performed after 5 h of
detorsion. EGb 761 (50 mg/kg, orally) was administrated only once, 40 min prior
to detorsion. To date, no more histopathological changes on testicular
torsion/detorsion induced ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats by EGb 761
treatment have been reported. Spermatogenesis and mean seminiferous tubule
diameter (MSTD) were significantly decreased in I/R groups were compared to the
control group. Furthermore, EGb 761 treated animals showed an improved
histological appearance in I/R group. Our data indicate a significant reduction
in the activity of TUNEL and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in testes
tissue of I/R treated with EGb 761 therapy. Electron microscopy of the testes of 
rats demonstrated that EGb 761 pretreatment was particularly effective in
preventing the mitochondrial degeneration, dilatation of SER and enlarged
intercellular spaces in both Sertoli and spermatid cells in I/R treated animals. 
We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of EGb 761 may
indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment on testes injury after I/R in
rats.

Dual infection of fetal and neonatal small ruminants with border disease virus
and peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV): neuronal tropism of PPRV as a novel 
finding.

Dual infection of 26 fetal and neonatal small ruminants with border disease virus
(BDV) and peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is reported. The animals
included five aborted lamb fetuses, 19 neonatal lambs and two neonatal kids from 
flocks in regions of the Black Sea and the Aegean region. BDV and PPRV antigens
were detected immunohistochemically in the brain, oral mucosa, intestine and lung
of infected animals. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to 
demonstrate PPRV and BDV in samples of the spleen, lymph node, lung and brain
from infected animals. On the basis of observations made, it is concluded that
brain damage following intrauterine infection with BDV facilitates the passage of
PPRV to the brain and results in infection of neuronal and glial cells by PPRV.

OBJECTIVE: Overdose of acetaminophen (APAP) can lead to severe liver injury in
humans and experimental animals. Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) is produced and released by 
several cell types. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether PTX-3 is a
potential biomarker in the identification of APAP-induced liver injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into
three groups: control, APAP-1 and APAP-2 groups. APAP-1 (1 g/kg) and APAP-2 (2
g/kg) group rats were given APAP by gastric tube. Liver tissues and blood samples
were obtained for biochemical and histopathological analysis. Biochemical
parameters, plasma and liver PTX-3 levels and degree of liver necrosis were
measured in all groups.
RESULTS: APAP treatments caused necrosis in liver and accompanied by elevated
liver PTX-3 levels after 48 h. In APAP-1 and APAP-2 groups when compared with
control group (7.5±3.3 ng/mg protein), mean liver PTX-3 concentrations were
14.1±3.0 (p=0.032) and 28.5±8.2 (p<0.001) ng/mg protein, respectively. All rats
(100%) in the APAP-2 group had the degree 3 liver necrosis. However 10%, 40% and 
50% of rats had the degree 1, the degree 2 and the degree 3 liver necrosis in the
APAP-1 group, respectively. The degrees of liver necrosis of the APAP-1 and
APAP-2 groups were higher than the group of control (p<0.001 and p<0.001,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: PTX-3 may have a role in the APAP-induced liver injury in the rats. 
The elevated liver PTX-3 in the APAP-induced hepatic necrosis might be a marker
of acute histological liver damage. Further prospective studies are necessary to 
clarify the prognostic value of liver PTX-3 for prediction of histological
hepatic necrosis in the APAP-induced liver injury.

The aim of this study is to determine the functional effects of the acrylamide
(AA) administrated by oral gavage on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and
the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) in male Sprague-Dawley rats using
alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) demonstration. For this purpose, two
separate experiments were performed with Sprague Dawley rats. In Experiment-I
rats were gavaged with 0, 30, 45 and 60 mg/kgb.w. AA for five consecutive days
and in Experiment-II rats were gavaged with 0, 125, 150, and 175 mg/kg/b.w. AA
for single oral dose. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatments in
both experiments by servical dislocations under ether anaesthesia. Blood samples 
were collected from the heart in heparinized (10 UI heparin/ml(-1) of the blood) 
tubes before sacrification and lymphoid tissue samples from the ileal Peyer's
patches (IPPs) were taken and processed for histochemical demonstration of ANAE
following the sacrification. The lymphoid follicles of the IPPs of animals given 
125, 150 and 175 mg/kgb.w. AA were markedly reduced in size. Germinal centres
(GCs) markedly regressed in AA-treated animals compared with those of controls.
ANAE-positive lymphocyte depletion of IPPs was very prominent in the high doses
AA-treated animals. In the animals treated with 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg b.w. AA, the
IPPs had similar histology to those of the controls. ANAE-positive peripheral
blood lymphocyte levels significantly decreased in AA exposed groups in a dose
dependent manner (p<0.05). In conclusion, AA has detrimental effects on
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) 
in rats.

Malignant glandular lesions and glandular differentiation in invasive/noninvasive
urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder.

Behzatoğlu K(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Istanbul Education and Research Hospital, Ministry of
Health, Istanbul, Turkey. kbehzatoglu@hotmail.com

Although the lumen of the urinary bladder is covered with only urothelial
epithelium, malign glandular lesions (eg, nonurachal adenocarcinoma) and benign
lesions (eg, cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis) can also rarely occur in 
this site due to its characteristic embryologic development. Glandular
differentiation is uncommon in urothelial carcinomas and is even less common in
noninvasive urothelial cancers. In addition, in situ urothelial carcinomas are
more likely to progress in the presence of glandular differentiation toward
high-grade urothelial carcinomas and/or aggressive urothelial carcinomas. Pure
nonurachal adenocarcinomas and mixed carcinomas (urothelial carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma) are very rare, and their pathogenesis is not clear. Most of the
nonurachal adenocarcinomas are thought to arise on the grounds of cystitis
glandularus with intestinal metaplasia. Here, I present 2 cases with noninvasive 
urothelial carcinoma with substantial glandular differentiation showing
progression to signet ring cell carcinoma and invasive urothelial carcinoma, one 
case with mixed carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) and another
case with pure adenocarcinoma developing from cystitis glandularis with
intestinal metaplasia, and discuss malign glandular lesions in the bladder and
invasive/noninvasive urothelial carcinomas with glandular differentiation.

We evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic significance 
of lung adenocarcinoma with micropapillary pattern (MPP) and analyzed the
expression of apoptosis-related markers: caspase-3, bcl-2, and p53. A series of
166 lung adenocarcinoma that had been surgically resected between 2004 and 2009
were reviewed. Histopathologic patterns, presence of tumor necrosis, mitosis,
lymphovascular and perineural invasion, the status of pleura, and tumor
differentiation were examined. Of the 166 patients; 71 were stage I, 35 stage II,
51 stage III, and nine stage IV. Histologically they were divided into two
groups: MPP-positive (n = 55) and MPP-negative (n = 111). The following items
were significantly more frequent in the MPP positive group: female gender (p =
0.03), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.031), and pleural invasion (p = 0.045). Age, 
smoking status, tumor stage, lymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, mitotic
count, and survival rates had no statistically significant difference between
groups (p > 0.05). In MPP positive tumors, visceral pleural invasion was
identified significantly more frequent than in MPP negative tumors, at stage I.
Tumors with MPP showed elevated expressions of caspase-3 (94.5%), p53 (60%), and 
bcl-2 (54.5%). In MPP positive group, the expression of these three markers had
no statistically significant impact on survival. In whole population, bcl-2
expression was correlated with a better outcome. We conclude that MPP is
associated with poor prognostic factors both in early and late stages in lung
adenocarcinoma. Bcl-2 provides prognostic information independent from the MPP.

Epithelioid schwannoma of soft tissue: unusual morphological variant causing a
diagnostic dilemma.

Epithelioid variant of peripheral nerve sheath tumors is a rare but, at the same 
time, a well-known entity especially in the malignant counterpart. However,
peculiar epithelioid morphology in soft tissue schwannomas is unusual and has
been defined recently. These tumors may cause diagnostic errors owing to their
increased cellularity and epithelioid morphology. Typical histologic features of 
classic schwannoma such as Antoni A and B areas, Verocay bodies, and hyalinized
vessels are either absent or only present in focal areas. Furthermore, strong and
diffuse S-100 protein expression is seen in both benign and malignant
counterparts of epithelioid schwannoma. The findings that are suggestive of the
benign nature of the lesion are long-term clinical history, small size,
superficial localization, encapsulation, bland morphology, lack of mitosis and
necrosis, and a benign clinical course after complete excision. Pathologists
should be aware of the epithelioid variant of schwannoma to avoid false diagnosis
of malignancy. We hereby report 3 cases of unusual benign epithelioid schwannoma 
of the soft tissue with special regard to problems in differential diagnosis.

Diseases, Istanbul, Turkey. nazandalgic@ttmail.com

OBJECTIVES: Genetic variants in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are considered a
potential indicator for host susceptibility to and outcome of several infectious 
diseases including tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether
-129 C/G and Met1Val polymorphisms of TLR8 were associated with pediatric
pulmonary tuberculosis in Turkish population.
METHODS: The -129 C/G and Met1Val polymorphisms were studied in 124 children with
pulmonary tuberculosis compared to 150 age-matched healthy control subjects.
RESULTS: We did not identify any statistically significant differences between
the patients with TB and control groups with regard to the frequency of genotypes
GG or G/(-), CG, and CC or C/(-); and alleles G and C at rs3764879 (p> 0.05). We 
found a strong association with genotype A/(-) at rs3764880 with susceptibility
to pulmonary TB in males (OR 2.87, 95%CI 1.38-5.98, p=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence, for the first time, of a role for the 
TLR8 gene in susceptibility to pulmonary TB in male children. Additional research
to verify our results are necessary. Tuberculosis in children presents
particularly difficult challenges, but research priorities and advances in
pediatric tuberculosis could provide wider insights and opportunities for
tuberculosis control.

Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (ScFN) is an uncommon condition of
neonates and infants. The disorder is caused by generalized and local tissue
hypoperfusion. The ScFN tends to improve spontaneously with or without some
severe complications such as hypercalcemia. The ScFN may occur as iatrogenic
after hypothermic surgical interventions. We present iatrogenic ScFN in a newborn
with uncomplicated hypercalcemia due to cold exposure on operating table during
at an umbilical cord hernia operation. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of a patient in whom ScFN occurred during a commonly performed and relatively
short-term "nonhypothermic" operation.

uterus.

In this study, we looked for a relationship between the extent of angiogenesis
and mast cell density (MCD) in human leiomyomas and endometrial carcinomas (EC), 
and investigated the clinicopathological relevance of mast cells (MCs) in EC.
Specimens of 15 control, 20 leiomyoma, and 23 EC patients were investigated
immunohistochemically using anti-CD31 and anti-tryptase antibodies. In EC, both
stromal and myometrial expressions of CD31 were significantly higher than in the 
controls (p<0.01 and p=0.013; respectively). Stromal tryptase expression was not 
significantly lower than that of leiomyoma. In addition, in the leiomyoma group, 
CD31 and tryptase expressions were not much different compared to the controls.
Moreover, a correlation was detected between cancer histological grade and both
stromal and myometrial expressions of CD31 (p=0.017 and p=0.005; respectively).
The findings show that high grade EC has a higher degree of vascularization than 
EC of lower grade, but MCD does not increase in parallel with the histological
grade. This study has demonstrated that MCD does not correlate with angiogenesis 
and progression of grade in EC. Moreover, MCD in EC was found to be lower than in
benign lesions of the uterus. In conclusion, MCs may not account for the
angiogenic process which facilitates tumor growth.

A case of cranioraschischisis including incomplete pentalogy of Cantrell (PC) is 
described. The female fetus had a large omphalocele with evisceration of the
heart, left lung, liver, stomach, and intestines accompanying anencephaly,
cervical, thoracal lumbar, spina bifida. The fetus had ectopia cordis and
diaphragmatic agenesia with an intact sternum. We present a case of a neonate
with the stigmata for PC with the exception of a sternal defect. A literature
review is also included. Sonographers should check for ventral and dorsal
anomalies with PC because they may occur simultaneously.

The Bethesda system (BS) for reporting thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA),
which classifies nodules as nondiagnostic (ND), benign (B), atypia/follicular
lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), suspicious for follicular
neoplasm (SFN/FN), suspicious for malignancy (SFM), or malignant (M), uses
clinically valuable management guidelines. The authors employed a similar
in-house classification system (IS) for thyroid FNAs, using the categories of ND,
B, suspicious follicular cells (SFC), follicular lesion/neoplasm (FL/FN), SFM,
and M. The authors compared IS and BS, and assessed the utility of BS in clinical
practice. A total of 581 nodules with cytological/histological follow-up were
examined and indeterminate lesions by BS were reclassified. The sensitivity and
specificity for malignancy using IS were similar to that of BS (77% vs 99%).
However, when SFN/FN and SFM were both considered positive, the results for IS
and BS were as follows: sensitivity, 85% versus 85%; specificity, 87% versus 94%;
and diagnostic accuracy, 86% versus 90%, respectively. Discrepancies between
cytological and histological data were evident in 35 cases among all categories
of BS except AUS/FLUS. The rate of surgery for nonmalignant nodules was lesser
(20% vs 9%) by BS. Among 34 AUS/FLUS cases with follow-up data, hypocellularity
was the case in 11 (46%) nonneoplastic and 10 (100%) neoplastic nodules. The use 
of BS results in a lower rate of surgery for nonmalignant nodules even though
patients with borderline cytopathologic features are still encountered. AUS/FLUS 
category can be separated into subgroups according to the factors causing
difficulties in the interpretation. There is a need of accumulation of AUS/FLUS
cases to do further evaluations and studies.

Regional lymph node status is the primary parameter determining treatment
strategies and prognoses in breast cancer. Lymphatic vessels in primary tumor
tissue play a significant role in lymphatic metastasis. The aim of this study was
to investigate the correlation of intra- and peritumoral lymphatic microvessel
densities (LVD) with prognostic parameters in breast cancer, including lymphatic 
invasion (LI). Lymphangiogenesis was investigated using D2-40 monoclonal antibody
in 69 invasive ductal carcinoma cases who underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph
node dissection. Positively stained microvessels were counted at 400× in dense
lymphatic vascular foci (hotspots). Tumor LI was established when at least one
neoplastic cell cluster was clearly visible inside a D2-40-positive lymph vessel.
Relationships were sought between clinicopathological parameters and mean LVD and
LI in primary tumor tissue. Peritumoral LVD was markedly higher than intratumoral
LVD (p < 0.001). No significant relationship was found between intratumoral LVD
and clinicopathological parameters (p > 0.05). However, significant relationships
were detected between peritumoral LVD and LVI [H&E] (p = 0.04), number of
lymphatic invasion [n/mm2, D2-40] (p = 0.001), tumor size (p = 0.01), lymph node 
status (p = 0.03), and tumor stage (p = 0.04). The immunohistochemical
determination of LI and LVD can contribute to the prediction of a tumor's
biological behavior in invasive ductal carcinomas. Peritumoral LVD in primary
tumor tissue is closely related to parameters influencing the prognosis of a
tumor.

Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met are suggested to play an
important role in progression of solid organ tumors by mediating cell motility,
invasion and metastasis. Overexpression of HGF and c-Met have been shown in
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their role in tumor progression is
not clearly defined. The aim of this study is to determine the role of HGF/c-Met 
pathway and its association with invasion related markers and clinicopathologic
parameters in NSCLC. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 63
paraffin-embedded NSCLC tumor sections. The expressions of invasion related
markers such as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, Tissue Inhibitor
Metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 and 3 and RhoA were also examined. Co-expression of
HGF/c-Met was significantly associated with lymph node invasion and TIMP-3 and
RhoA overexpressions. There were positive correlation between TIMP-3
overexpression and advanced stage and negative correlation between RhoA
overexpression and survival. DNA sequencing for Met mutations in both nonkinase
and tyrosine kinase (TK) domain was established. A single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in sema domain and two SNPs in TK domain of c-Met were found. There was no 
statistically significant correlation between the presence of c-Met alterations
and clinicopathologic parameters except shorter survival time in cases with two
SNPs in TK domain. These results suggest that HGF/c-Met might exert their effects
in tumor progression in association with RhoA and probably with TIMP-3. The
blockade of the HGF/c-Met pathway with RhoA and/or TIMP-3 inhibitors may be an
effective therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.

Laryngeal malignant tumors are mainly composed of squamous cell carcinomas.
Glandular carcinomas of the larynx are rare tumors that constitute less than 1%
of all laryngeal malignancies where "adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified" is
the most common histologic subtype. Here we report a case of a 70-year-old female
patient with primary laryngeal mucinous adenocarcinoma. The rarity of the tumor
type and the differential diagnosis of this tumor before reporting it as a
primary adenocarcinoma of the larynx are discussed here with literature findings.

The diagnosis and treatment of TB infection is one of the public health
priorities. Until recently, diagnosis of TB infection has been based on the
tuberculin skin test (TST). However, this is neither 100% sensitive nor specific 
for the diagnosis of TB infection owing to its many drawbacks. More recently,
T-cell-based IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) have been developed. In this article,
we review the clinical performance of one of the IGRAs, T-SPOT.TB assay, for the 
diagnosis of TB infection in adults and children. We discuss the principle of the
assay, its utility in active TB diseases, latent TB infection and the performance
of the test in specialized subgroups of patients, such as immunocompromised
individuals. When compared with the TST, the T-SPOT.TB assay has better
specificity in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals, and data suggest 
that T-SPOT.TB may be more sensitive than the TST. Data in groups at high risk of
progression to disease support the idea that T-SPOT.TB performs better than the
TST. In addition, application of T-SPOT.TB by using bodily fluids such as
cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural fluid may offer new
diagnostic approaches in extrapulmonary TB disease. Although IGRAs cannot
distinguish active TB disease from latent TB infection, these assays perform
better than the TST for the detection of TB infection.

BACKGROUND: One of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of Behçet disease
(BD) and recurrent aphthous ulcerations (RAU) is a cell-mediated immune response 
in which several cytokines (interleukin-2, interleukin-6) and T regulatory cell
(T reg cell) population seem to play a major role. The aim of this study was to
measured the interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and analysis of
CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp-3(+) Treg cells in peripheral blood from patients with BD and
RAU. In addition; we also analysed peripheral blood from healthy subjects for
comparison.
METHODS: Thirty patients (15 men and 15 women) with BD, 30 patients (12 men and
18 women) with RAU and 15 healthy control subjects (nine men and six women)
participated in the study. Analysis of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp-3(+) Treg cells, IL-2 
and IL-6 levels have been measured in flow cytometry.
RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed in the serum levels of IL-2 and
IL-6 between BD and RAU patients, and healthy subjects. Although there were no
statistical differences in the number of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp-3(+) cells between
groups, there were statistically significant differences in the number of CD4(+) 
CD25(bright) Treg cells. CD4(+) CD25(bright) Treg cells were significantly
increased in BD and RAU patients compared to healthy subjects. Statistical
analysis revealed no difference according to the number of CD4(+) CD25(bright)
cells between BD and RAU patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CD4(+) CD25(bright) T regulatory cells
may be contributing factor in the pathogenesis of BD and RAU.

Emergence of a high-grade sarcoma in a recurrent meningioma: malignant
progression or collision tumor?

Anaplastic meningiomas that resemble sarcomas often reveal clues to their
meningothelial differentiation or develop in a plausible setting that confirms
their meningothelial origin. Malignant mesenchymal neoplasms without obvious
evidence of meningothelial differentiation or origin are more likely to be true
primary or metastatic sarcomas. Because of their clinical and biological
differences, it is important to distinguish anaplastic meningioma from a sarcoma.
We present a 67-year-old woman with multiple meningiomas, who developed a
high-grade spindle cell tumor 6 months after the resection of a World Health
Organization grade I meningioma. It was not clear whether this tumor represented 
a malignant transformation of meningioma or a primary sarcoma. Malignant
transformation of a meningioma is exceptional within this short period and a
coexisting sarcoma and meningioma are equally uncommon. Even though these
malignant neoplasms are rare in general, they appear to be more prevalent in
patients with multiple meningiomas including those with neurofibromatosis type 2.

Palpable lesion(s) noticed in a patient with thoracic disease may be a useful
diagnostic tool and it often gives a clue for further management. In this study, 
we searched the diagnostic value of palpable lesions in patients with thoracic
pathology suspected clinically and/or radiologically. We prospectively examined
the correlations of clinical/radiologic and pathologic findings of 72 palpable
lesions from 68 patients who presented with suspect for a thoracic disease from
two tertiary medical centers. Thirty-two lesions (44.4%) were diagnosed as
malignant either by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) only or FNA with confirmatory
biopsy. The most common malignancy was non-small-cell carcinoma (10) followed by 
adenocarcinoma (6), and small-cell carcinoma (5). The most common localization of
the palpable lesions was cervical region (20.8%) followed by left supraclavicular
(13.8%) and anterior chest wall (13.8%). FNA was effective in obtaining an
accurate diagnosis in 66.6% of the patients. Tissue confirmation of FNA was
performed in 54 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive
value, and positive predictive value of FNA in distinguishing a malignant lesion 
from a benign disease for these palpable lesions were 75, 97, 96, and 80,
respectively. One false negativity and one false positivity were also found.
Abnormal radiologic features were not correlated with having a malignant palpable
lesion. Evaluation of the palpable lesions by FNA and tissue biopsy together is
effective for initial triage of the patients with suspect for a thoracic
pathology. FNA alone is a convenient and easy method for this purpose especially 
when the material is immediately assessed for specimen adequacy.

CD10 is a zinc dependent metallopeptidase, and its expression in stromal and/or
epithelial cells of many carcinomas has been suggested to have prognostic value. 
This study investigates CD10 expression in epithelial and stromal cells of non
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and evaluates its prognostic value for this
tumor and its histologic subtypes. Sixty-six cases of NSCLC [35 cases of
nonsquamous cell carcinoma (NSCC) and 31 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)] 
were analyzed immuno-histochemically for CD10 antibody. Fisher's exact test and
univariate survival analyses were performed. Comparison of clinicopathologic
characteristics for NSCLC showed that only stromal CD10 expression had worse
prognostic impact, associated with the presence of recurrence (p = 0.001), death 
(p = 0.006) and disease positivity (p = 0.001). For SCC, CD10 was found to be
expressed mainly in the stromal cells, and was associated with a decreased
survival (p = 0.000) and disease free survival (p = 0.000). CD10 expression was
restricted to the epithelial cells in NSCC and associated with an increased
disease free survival (p = 0.036). Stromal CD10 expression apppears to be a worse
prognostic factor in NSCLCs. CD10 which is expressed in different cell components
of SCC and NSCC appears to have opposing effects on the behaviour of these
histologic types.

High levels of SOX4 gene expression have been reported in a variety of human
cancers. The protein may function in the apoptosis pathway, leading to cell death
as well as to tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels 
of SOX4 expression in bladder cancer. Urinary bladder tumor samples were obtained
from 57 bladder cancer and 13 normal bladder biopsies. The levels of SOX4
expression in bladder cancer were determined by immunohistochemistry and
real-time PCR. SOX4 gene expression was increased 2.2 times in bladder tumors as 
compared with normal tissue. The presence of protein was confirmed by
immunostaining. There were significant differences between immunostaining of
bladder tumors and normal bladder tissue (P=0.001). The present data suggest that
SOX4 gene may have a role in bladder cancer tumorigenesis.

Invasion pathogenesis is one of the most complicated issues in the literature.
There are numerous studies concerning the tumor markers implicated in the
preinvasive-invasive tumor sequence. Despite ample studies on the invasion
pathogenesis of cutaneous melanomas, there is limited and dispersed work
presently available on non-melanoma skin cancer. The vast knowledge in the
literature concerning this issue in squamous cell carcinoma comes mostly from the
studies of the oral cavity, esophagus, larynx, and cervix. In this study, we
investigated tumor-free neighboring stroma and tumor stroma in squamous cell
carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin as well as keratoacanthomas (KAs) with respect to
the presence of stromal CD34-positive (CD34+) fibrocytes and α-smooth muscle
actin-positive (α-SMA+) myofibroblasts using seborrheic keratosis (SKs) and
non-tumoral skin samples as controls. We also evaluated the stromal expression
pattern of CD26/DPPIV (CD26), a tumor suppressor gene product that also has
immunoregulatory properties. Immunohistochemistry was performed on samples of 31 
SCC, 8 KA, 15 SK and 10 non-tumoral skin samples. Peri-tumoral stroma from
resection margins was also evaluated. We found that CD34 and α-SMA demonstrated
significantly different staining between benign and malignant squamous skin
lesions consisting of a loss of CD34+ fibrocytes paralleled by a gain of α-SMA+
myofibroblasts in malignant tumor stroma. Additionally, it was shown that CD26
expression was lower in tumor stroma when compared to that of tumor neighboring
stroma. However, we concluded that this finding may be attributable to the solar 
elastosis areas in the peritumoral tissue, which shows diffuse strong positivity 
for this marker.

We describe here a patient with a metastatic malignant melanoma displaying
crescentic lesions in the glomeruli. A 64-year-old woman was referred to our
hospital because of a sudden increase of serum creatinine. Clinical diagnosis
suggested rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse
crescentic lesions containing metastatic melanoma cells. These cells were also
seen in the glomerular capillary lumina and tubules, and a few scattered tumor
cells were also present in the interstitium. Glomerular metastasis is a very rare
entity. To the best of our knowledge, this patient is the first to be described
in the English language literature showing intraglomerular metastasis of
malignant melanoma as demonstrated by needle biopsy and is only the second
patient with intraglomerular metastasis presenting with acute renal failure.

House paints, the industrial products of toxic chemicals are known to be linked
with severe respiratory disturbances especially in inadequately ventilated
places. In this study, we aimed to report a biopsy-proven case of extrinsic
allergic alveolitis (EAA) who presented with nonspecific respiratory symptoms 1
month after having her whole house interior painted. At CT scanning, we observed 
the ground glass opacities and the micronodular pattern typical for EAA and also 
a solid, consolidative lung area, highly suggestive of malignancy. The case
initially was misinterpreted as a malignant tumor both radiologically and
cytologically at CT-guided transthoracic fine needle aspiration biopsy. The final
pathologic diagnosis was given as EAA on frozen section performed during
thoracotomy operation. The patient received short-term steroid treatment and has 
been doing well for the last 7 months after her operation. As a conclusion, when 
assessing a cytologic material from a patient who has got a solid lung mass and
also a history of chemical dye exposure, consolidative mass formation which is a 
rare form of EAA should always be kept in mind. Another final point is that the
appropriate ventilation should be achieved if the exposure with the house paint
chemicals is inevitable.

Brain microvascular pericytes in health and disease.

Sciences and Psychiatry, Hacettepe University, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey.

Pericytes are located at periphery of the microvessel wall and wrap it with their
processes. They communicate with other cells of the neurovascular unit by direct 
contact or through signaling pathways and regulate several important
microcirculatory functions. These include development and maintenance of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB), distribution of the capillary blood flow to match the 
local metabolic need of the nearby cells, and angiogenesis. Pericytes also
exhibit phagocytic activity and may function as pluripotent stem cells.
Increasing evidence suggests a role for pericytes in a wide range of CNS
diseases. They appear to be vulnerable to oxygen and nitrogen radical toxicity
and have been shown to contract during cerebral ischemia and remain contracted
despite reopening of the occluded artery. This causes impaired re-flow and may
diminish the benefit of re-canalization therapies in stroke patients.
Hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction of the signaling pathways between pericytes and
endothelia is thought to play an important role in diabetic retinopathy, a common
cause of blindness. Amyloid deposits detected within degenerating pericytes in
the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease suggest that pericyte dysfunction
may play a role in cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid β-peptide
clearance in Alzheimer's disease. This exciting possibility may reveal a novel
temporal sequence of events in chronic neurodegeneration, in which microvascular 
dysfunction due to pericyte degeneration initiates secondary neurodegenerative
changes. Identification of molecular mechanisms by which pericytes regulate BBB
integrity in inflammatory conditions as well as in vasogenic brain edema may lead
to new treatments. Pericytes may also take part in tissue repair and
vascularization after CNS injury. In conclusion, although the evidence is just
emerging and mostly preliminary, disclosing pericytes' role in the
pathophysiology of CNS diseases may yield exciting developments and novel
treatments.

Legionella pneumophila is a cause of both community- and hospital-acquired
pneumonia and might cause high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early
diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antibiotics is crucial. Many clinical
and laboratory abnormalities can be observed in the course of Legionella
pneumonia. In this study, we aimed to present simultaneously increased serum
ferritin and myoglobin level in a legionella case with reference to the relevant 
literature.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a potentially life-threatening liver
infection which may progress to liver failure and cirrhosis. Intrahepatic
expression patterns of viral antigens detected by immunohistochemistry may have
prognostic implications in disease process.
AIM: In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the HBV core
antigen (HBcAg) expression and histological activity index (HAI), fibrosis, serum
hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) status and HBV DNA levels in patients with chronic 
HBV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 114 liver biopsies from patients with chronic
HBV infection were included in the study. Immunohistochemical expression of HBcAg
and its relation with HAI, fibrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels,
HBeAg status and HBV DNA levels were assessed.
RESULTS: The presence of nuclear expression of HBcAg did not show any
correlations with ALT levels, HAI and fibrosis score. When the groups were
categorized according to the HBeAg status, nuclear HBcAg expression was found to 
be high in HBeAg positive patients. However, HBcAg nuclear expression showed
significant correlations with HBV DNA levels and fibrosis scores in HBeAg
negative but not HBeAg positive patients. HBV DNA levels were also significantly 
associated with HAI and fibrosis scores in HBeAg negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences found between HBeAg positive and negative
patients suggest that HBeAg negative disease is different from HBeAg positive
disease, and also point outs that in HBeAg negative disease, patients with
nuclear HBcAg expression and increased levels of HBV DNA levels are at a higher
risk of developing progressive liver disease.

BACKGROUND: Columnar cell lesions (CCLs) with or without atypia frequently
coexist with invasive or in situ breast carcinomas. In this study, 39 mastectomy 
specimens containing CCLs coexisting with invasive carcinomas were
retrospectively analyzed for cellular characteristics and structural pattern of
CCL neighboring the tumor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), and p53 antibodies in CCL and coexisting invasive tumors, type of 
invasive tumor, histopathologic grade, and presence of atypia in CCL have been
studied.
RESULTS: Sixteen (41%) of all CCLs were with atypia, whereas 23 (59%) of them
were without atypia. No correlations were found between the presence of CCLs with
atypia and either the morphologic type of carcinoma or histopathologic grade of
the tumors. Presence of atypia in the CCL was not correlated with the expression 
of p53 in the invasive tumors. CCLs without atypia dominated in Grade III tumors.
The percentages of CCLs without atypia were also higher in both ER (-) and PR (-)
tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: CCL with atypia is generally considered to be a precursor of
invasive carcinoma; however, in our study, CCLs without atypia more frequently
coexisted with breast carcinoma.

AIMS: Duodenal nodularity is an uncommon endoscopic appearance of numerous
visible mucosal nodules in the proximal duodenum. In this retrospective study we 
aimed to determine the clinical significance and histopathologic features of
duodenal nodularity in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of the patients who were defined to
have duodenal nodularity by endoscopy were reviewed.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The data were expressed as mean ± SD and percentages
(%).
RESULTS: Seventeen patients with endoscopically defined duodenal nodularity were 
chosen. The mean age at diagnosis was 12.1 years (range: 6-17 years), 9 males.
Abdominal pain (47%) was the most common clinical symptom and antral nodularity
(41%) was the most common endoscopic finding in children with duodenal
nodularity. Histopathologic evaluation of duodenal nodules revealed chronic
inflammation in all patients, increased intercryptal and intraepithelial numbers 
of eosinophils in 70.5%, and villous atrophy in 47% of patients. Giardia
infestation was demonstrated in 6 patients by histologic examination and/or
Giardia lamblia-specific antigen positivity in stools. The clinical diagnoses of 
the patients have shown variations, such as celiac disease, giardiasis, secretory
IgA deficiency, and Helicobacter pylori gastritis, and some of them were
associated with the others.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the endoscopic appearance is similar, clinical spectrum and
pathologic features are not so similar and there are no specific histomorphologic
findings for nodularity. The most demonstrative findings we observed in children 
were increased lymphocyte and/or eosinophil infiltration in the duodenal mucosa. 
We suggested that care should be taken in the evaluation of microbiological and
immunologic etiologies causing this prominent inflammatory reaction.

Turkey. ibrahimgelincik@mynet.com

BACKGROUND: The most common second primary cancer in women who survive breast
cancer is colorectal cancer. Population cohort studies suggest that the risk of
colorectal cancer is also high in female relatives of women with breast cancer
compared to the general population. The histological distinction between a large 
hyperplastic polyp and a serrated adenoma is not straightforward and there is
probably no sharp division between hyperplastic polyposis and 'serrated
adenomatous polyposis'.
AIM: The aim of the study was to define the distribution of Ki-67 and Bcl-2
protein in hyperplastic colorectal polyps of women with breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, controlled study was conducted in 40
women with and without breast cancer who had hyperplastic colorectal polyps. The 
patients were divided into two groups: Group A (a control group of women without 
breast cancer, n = 20) and Group B (a study group of women with breast cancer, n 
= 20). The expression of Ki-67 and Bcl-2 protein was assessed on the basis of
quantity of immunostaining, by counting antigen positive cells, in comparison
with normal mucosa. Student's t-test and the chi-square test were used to analyse
Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression, respectively.
RESULTS: Statistical significance was established at P < 0.05. The mean
percentage of Ki-67 stained nuclei in Groups A and B was 25.11 ± 2.07 and 41.51 ±
1.86, respectively (P < 0.003), whereas the percentage of cases with cells
expressing Bcl-2 in Groups A and B was 15% and 85%, respectively (P < 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, greater proliferative activity and greater
expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was found in the hyperplastic
colorectal polyps of women with breast cancer.

The effects of maternal influenza on the fetus are not well understood. Viremia
is believed to occur infrequently and thus vertical transmission appears to be
rare. Highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus, such as avian influenza A
(H5N1), are more likely to be transmitted across the placenta. Placental tissues 
of seven women with confirmed H1N1 infection were examined molecularly with
RT-PCR and microscopically to investigate whether H1N1 virus vertically
transmitted. We found no evidence for placental transmission of H1N1 virus in
this study. In the absence of vertical transmission, adverse effects like
neonatal seizures, encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and even neonatal death can
still occur. Since a significant knowledge gap exists for the effects of this
novel virus on the fetus, further studies will be beneficial.

Mature teratoma of adrenal gland is a rare entity. Neurocytoma is a low grade
neuronal tumor even rarely seen among central nervous system tumors. Nervous
system tumors arising in teratomas are frequently originated from glial or
primitive neuroectodermal cells. Here we report a neurocytoma arising in mature
cystic teratoma in the right adrenal gland of an 8 years old boy. Histological
examination revealed a tumor composed of solid sheets in fibrillar basis with
small uniform cells in the neuroglial tissue in teratoma. This is only the second
case demonstrating a neurocytoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma in the
literature.

Primary malignant deciduoid peritoneal mesothelioma: a report of the
cytohistological and immunohistochemical appearances.

(1)Department of Pathology, Ministry of Health, Ankara Training and Research
Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. nuransungu@gmail.com

Malignant deciduoid mesothelioma (MDM) is a rare variant of epithelioid
mesothelioma. This type of tumor might be associated with the asbestos exposure
and carries a poor prognosis in general. MDM was first described by Nascimento et
al. in 1994 in a peritoneal lesion of a young woman. And its diagnosis is
frequently mistaken with florid mesothelial hyperplasia and peritoneal
deciduosis. There are 44 MDM cases reported in the literature up today. A
59-year-old woman patient referred to our clinic was identified with an abdominal
mass. Computed tomography of whole abdomen of the patient showed a mass with the 
widest transverse dimension of 65 × 60 mm at abdominal bifurcation in the
mesenteric region. The patient was diagnosed with MDM after the cytopathological 
examination of the fine needle aspiration biopsy performed from the mass.
Consequently, she received a total mass excision and right hemicolectomy under
general anesthesia. The cytomorphological appearance of the ascitic fluid is
detailed for the first time by Gillespie et al. and is described only in two
manuscripts. In the present study, we aimed to report a case of a 59-year-old
woman since she was diagnosed with MDM and because her cytological findings were 
further supported by histomorphological and immunohistochemical evaluations of
the operation material obtained from the patient.

Immunohistochemical study of E-cadherin and β-catenin expression in colorectal
carcinomas.

Parameters of histological type, differentiation, lymph node metastasis and stage
have been observed to indicate the prognosis of colorectal carcinomas.
Immunohistochemically E-cadherin and β -catenin expression of tumour cells have
been evaluated to define life expectancy, response to the treatment, metastatic
disease and recurrence of tumour in correlation with these prognostic parameters.
60 cases diagnosed as colorectal adenocarcinoma were selected to be studied
retrospectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed using E-cadherin and β
-catenin primary antibodies and avidin-biotin-peroxidase. 53 of 60 adenocarcinoma
tissues were evaluated as classical type adenocarcinoma and 7 of them as mucinous
carcinoma. 48 classical type adenocarcinoma tissues showed membranous staining
for E-cadherin, 13 tissues showed cytoplasmic staining. All 53 adenocarcinoma
tissues expressed nuclear or membranous type β -catenin in different intensities.
Reduced E-cadherin expression significantly correlated with lymph nodes
metastasis (p = 0.01). E-cadherin expression significantly correlated with
increasing histological differentiation (p = 0.04). When E-cadherin and β
-catenin expressions were compared, there was a significant difference between
the tumour stage, histological differentiation and the existence of lymph node
metastasis. When both E-cadherin and β -catenin expressions were reduced, there
was a significant unfavourable prognosis.

The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine
mouthrinse (CHX) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in
patients with untreated gingivitis. Fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to 
CHX or placebo groups. CHX group rinsed with 0.2% CHX, while placebo group rinsed
with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. Subgingival plaque samples were collected
and plaque index (PI), papilla bleeding index (PBI), calculus index, and probing 
pocket depth (PPD) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. The amounts of
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella
intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria
were detected by quantitative real-time PCR method. In the CHX group the total
bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p <
0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p >
0.05). CHX mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in
the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival
total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.

Intra-articular epithelioid sarcoma showing mixed classic and proximal-type
features: report of 2 cases, with immunohistochemical and molecular cytogenetic
INI-1 study.

Epithelioid sarcoma, a rare sarcoma with epithelial differentiation, most often
occurs in the distal extremities; however, it may occur in essentially any
location. With the recent recognition that the loss of expression of the
tumor-suppressor gene INI-1 may be associated with epithelioid sarcoma, it has
become clear that epithelioid sarcoma may occur in previously unsuspected
locations such as bone. Only 2 cases of intra-articular epithelioid sarcoma have 
been previously reported. We retrieved 2 intra-articular cases coded as
epithelioid sarcoma from our archives. Both expressed cytokeratins (AE1/AE3 and
OSCAR), CD34, vimentin, and epithelial membrane antigen, and showed complete loss
of expression of INI-1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections by using a laboratory-developed
dual-color probe containing INI1 (CTD-2511E13 and CTD-2034E7) (22q11.2) (OR) and 
PANX2 (RPCI3-402G11) (22q13.33) (GR) probes as control. Both cases occurred in a 
clearly intra-articular location in the knee. Case 1 was that of a 19-year-old
man with a long-standing history of pain and limited joint function. This patient
was disease free after amputation. Case 2 was that of a 60-year-old woman.
Follow-up information available for this patient showed bilateral subpleural
metastases. Morphologically, case 1 showed features of proximal-type epithelioid 
sarcoma, whereas case 2 showed mixed features of classic and proximal-type
epithelioid sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry showed complete loss of INI-1 protein
in both cases; fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were negative for
INI-1 gene deletion. Herein, we have reported 2 cases of intra-articular
epithelioid sarcoma, showing morphologic and immunohistochemical features
identical to those of epithelioid sarcoma in conventional locations, including
loss of INI-1 expression. Intra-articular epithelioid sarcoma should be
distinguished from malignant pigmented villonodular synovitis and from carcinoma 
metastatic to the synovium. Improved recognition of this rare clinical
presentation should allow for better understanding of its unique features.

After surgery, the most common foreign bodies retained in the abdominal cavity
are the surgical sponges. The aim of the present study was to emphasize the
importance of gossypiboma, which is a serious and medicolegal problem. The
records of 12 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of gossypiboma after abdominal 
surgery at Dicle University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed between
January 1994 and December 2009. Eight of the 12 patients were females, and 4 were
males. Previously, 7 patients had been operated on electively, and 5 had
undergone operations on an emergency basis. Abdominal ultrasonography clearly
demonstrated gossypibomas in 5 patients, and computed tomography demonstrated a
more precise image of retained surgical sponges in 3 patients. One patient died
because of ventricular fibrillation; the other 11 patients were discharged in
good health. To eliminate the risk of gossypibomas, all sponges should be counted
at least twice (once preoperatively and once postoperatively); use of small
sponges should be avoided during laparotomy, and only sponges with radiopaque
markers should be used. The surgeon should explore the abdomen before closure. In
cases in which the sponge count is uncertain, an abdominal x-ray should be
performed before closure.

Follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is the most common variant
of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after classical PTC (CPTC). In this study,
we aimed to compare functional status, ultrasonographical features, cytological
results, and histopathological characteristics of patients with CPTC and FVPTC.
Preoperative thyroid functions, thyroid autoantibodies, ultrasonographical
features, cytology, and histopathology results of 354 (79.9%) CPTC and 90 (20.3%)
FVPTC patients were reviewed retrospectively. Sex distribution, mean age, thyroid
autoantibody positivity, and thyroid dysfunctions were similar in two groups.
Among 320 patients with preoperative ultrasonography (US) findings, a hypoechoic 
halo was observed more frequently (p=0.003), and marginal irregularity was
observed less commonly (p=0.024) in FVPTC lesions. In CPTC, rate of malignant
cytology (p=0.001), and in FVPTC, rate of suspicious cytology (p<0.001) were
significantly higher. Histopathologically, mean tumor diameter was markedly
higher in FVPTC compared to CPTC (16.89 ± 13.86 vs 10.64 ± 9.70 mm, p<0.001),
while capsular invasion and extrathyroidal spread were significantly lower in
patients with FVPTC (p=0.018 and p=0.039, respectively). FVPTC tend to have more 
benign features in US and less malignant results in cytology. Higher tumor size
in FVPTC might be explained by the recognition of clinical importance of these
lesions after reaching particular sizes due to benign US features.

Argyrophilic nucleolar organizing region associated proteins (AgNORs) have been
shown to be of interest in a variety of different diseases including thyroid
disorders. Our aim was to distinguish benign thyroid lesions from papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) via AgNOR count and with a new approach, via AgNOR
surface area/total nuclear surface area (NORa/TNa) proportions in the nuclei on
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) materials. Thirty patients (eight men and 22 women) 
whose FNA was compatible with benign lesion and 26 patients (eight men and 18
women) whose FNA was compatible with PTC were included in the study. Fine-needle 
aspiration materials were stained for AgNOR detection according to a specific
protocol. One hundred nuclei per individual have been evaluated, and AgNOR number
and NORa/TNa proportions of individual cells were measured and calculated by
using a computer program. Patients with PTC had significantly (p<0.001) higher
AgNOR count (4.6 ± 1.2%) than in the patients with benign lesions (2.0 ± 0.5%).
Additionally, patients with PTC had significantly (p<0.001) higher NORa/TNa (13.4
± 2.4) than in the patients with benign lesion (5.7 ± 1.0). Modified method of
AgNOR staining is an easy and reliable method for evaluating proliferation
activity of cells in malignant and benign thyroid lesions and it may contribute
to routine cytopathology in inconclusive situations.

Antalya, Turkey. atkdr_ibrahim@yahoo.com

Forensic anthropologists are aware that there are considerable differences
between human populations and therefore develop study models for each skeletal
population. The purpose of this study was to analyze forearm bones obtained from 
forensic settings in Turkey. The sample consists of 42 males and 38 females with 
an average age of 40 and 36 years, respectively. Numerous measurements were taken
from the radius and ulna including lengths (in millimeters), midshaft diameters, 
and epiphyseal breadths (0.01 mm). Individuals with any anomaly and pathology
were not included in the investigation. A stepwise analysis, when applied to
individual bones, selected only length and midshaft transverse dimension in the
radius and length only in the ulna. When the length was excluded from the
statistic, head diameter and distal breadth of the radius and distal minimum head
and midshaft anteroposterior diameters of the ulna provided the best predicting
functions. Classification results were 92% for the radius and 91% for the ulna.
For the incomplete bones, the accuracy rates were about 92% and 83%,
respectively. In conclusion, a sex determination was made, in different rates of 
accuracy, in the human skeleton. Correct assessment can vary among populations.
Dimorphism in our region forearm bones is greater than American whites. This
supported the hypothesis that human variation is diverse, and population
difference should be taken into account when osteometric standards are applied to
others. Further studies are needed to understand why the forearm is more
dimorphic in Turks.

The aim of this study is to define the diagnostic role of Liqui-Prep (LP)
technique for the diagnosis of thyroid lesions and to assess interobserver
variabilities. In all, 98 thyroid FNA (fine needle aspiration) cytology samples
from 83 patients for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules, prepared by the 
LP, were examined. The LP slides were independently evaluated by three
pathologists and they were classified into the five categories according to the
Bethesda system. The histopathologic diagnoses were grouped as follows: benign,
follicular neoplasm, and malignant. Agreements between LP and histopathologic
diagnoses were investigated using kappa values. Marginal homogenity and kappa
tests were used for statistical analysis for the evaluation of the agreement
between the pathologists and the interobserver variability of the thyroid
aspiration cytology results. The presence of nucleoli, nuclear grooving,
overlapping, intranuclear inclusion, and nuclear irregularity were recorded and
scored on each case based on LP slide review. Concurrences between LP and the
histologic diagnoses for the three pathologists were almost perfect (k = 0.798; k
= 0.826; k = 0.880). When the observers were paired there was no significant
difference from the diagnostic point of view. Interobserver agreement among the
three pathologists was moderate. Initially diagnostic difficulties may occur
because of the inadequate experience of the pathologists concerning the
evaluation of the cytologic changes associated with this new technique.
Liqui-Prep technique is useful for the cytologic diagnosis of the thyroid
nodules. The nuclear irregularity was the most essential feature for the
differentiation of malignant lesions from follicular neoplasm by the LP method.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and histopathological
characteristics of hepatic granulomas. All records of liver biopsies/resections
evaluated in our pathology department between 2002 and 2009 were retrospectively 
reviewed. Specimens with hepatic granulomas were reexamined by a designated
pathologist. Type and localization of granulomas, size of granulomas and
epithelioid histiocytes, and the morphological findings of surrounding liver
tissue were recorded in an attempt to establish a correlation with relevant
clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Out of 1420 liver biopsy/resected
specimens evaluated at our institution during the study period, 86 cases of
epithelioid cell granulomas (6.05%) were observed. Of the 86 cases, 23 were men
and 63 were women. The most common underlying etiology was PBC in 38 patients,
infections in 34, malignancies in five, sarcoidosis in four, and foreign bodies
in three patients. One case (1.2%) of a drug-induced hepatic granuloma was
encountered, while another case was deemed idiopathic (of unknown etiology).
Contrary to common belief, granulomas were observed not only in early stage PBC
but also in cases with stage 3 disease. Out of all the PBC cases with granulomas,
55.6% had stage 3 disease, and besides periductal granulomas, intraacinar
granulomas were also seen. For sarcoidosis, intra- and peri-granulomatous
fibrosis was observed in as many as 75% of cases. A large majority of granulomas 
(82.4%) associated with infections were of the necrotizing type. Extensive
evaluation of the morphological characteristics of hepatic granulomas and
surrounding liver tissue along with clinical, radiological, and other laboratory 
findings may help arrive at an accurate diagnosis in a majority of cases. Rather 
than being a final diagnosis, the presence of hepatic granulomas entails the need
for further investigations towards identifying the underlying etiology, with a
pathologist being at the center of the diagnostic process.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) is currently the best initial diagnostic test
for evaluation of a thyroid nodule. FNA cytology cannot discriminate between
benign and malignant thyroid nodules in up to 30% of thyroid nodules. Therefore, 
an adjunct to FNA is needed to clarify these lesions as benign or malignant.
Using differential display-polymerase chain reaction method, the gene expression 
differences between follicular and classic variants of papillary thyroid
carcinoma (PTC) and benign thyroid nodules were evaluated in a group of 42
patients. Computational gene function analyses via Cytoscape, FuncBASE, and
GeneMANIA led us to a functional network of 17 genes in which a core sub-network 
of five genes coexists. Although the exact mechanisms underlying in thyroid
cancer biogenesis are not currently known, our data suggest that the pattern of
transformation from healthy cells to cancer cells of PTC is different in
follicular variant than in classic variant.

The PTPN22 C1858T gene polymorphism has been recently reported to be associated
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in European and North American ancestry. In
contrast, the frequency of PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism is extremely rare in Asian 
and African populations. As the genetic heterogeneity between populations is
clearly present in RA, we wanted to investigate whether the PTPN22 C1858T
polymorphism is associated with RA in Turkey and with autoantibody positivity. A 
total of 323 RA patients and 426 healthy controls were genotyped by polymerase
chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism for the PTPN22 C1858T
polymorphism (rs2476601). The frequencies of heterozygote genotype (CT) were 8.4%
in RA patients and 5.4% in the healthy controls, respectively [odds ratio (OR):
1.6, P = 0.14]. The homozygote genotype (T/T) was absent in both RA patients and 
the healthy controls. When compared with the healthy controls, we found the
significant associations between the frequency of PTPN22 heterozygote (CT)
polymorphism and RA patients with RF positivity and anti-CCP positivity,
respectively (OR: 2.05, P = 0.04 and OR: 2.1, P = 0.03, respectively). Our study 
suggests that the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism acts as a susceptibility gene for
autoantibody-positive RA in Turkey.

In this study, we analyzed Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 expressions in colon
carcinomas. We investigated the relationship between the expression of these
tight junction proteins and clinicopathologic parameters. Claudin-1 and 4
expressions were determined by immunohistochemical methods, and the rate of cells
expressing these tight junction proteins were calculated with stereologic
methods. Fifty-nine colon cancer cases were enrolled in the study group.
Claudin-1 and 4 expressions were found to be significantly lower in cases with
lymph node metastasis. Mean staining rates of Claudin-1 and 4 in lymph node (+)
cases were 36.1±20.1 and 58±28.9, while in lymph node (-) cases, these were
63.8±25.9 and 72.3±25.6, respectively (p=0.0005 for Claudin-1, p=0.049 for
Claudin-4). The mean staining rate for Claudin-1 in adenomatous polyps was
significantly higher than incarcinomas (77.13±23.4 and 50.6±26.93, respectively) 
(p=0.003), while it was quite similar for Claudin-4 (65.4±26.9 and 65.3±27.9,
respectively). In this study, we demonstrated Claudin-1 and 4 expressions in
colon cancer cases. Claudin-1 expression seems to be more prominent in
adenomatous polyps as compared with cancer cases. Expression of Claudin-1
decreases significantly in the presence of lymph node metastasis and diminishes
in mucinous carcinoma cases, indicating a negative correlation between Claudin-1 
expression and neoplastic progression.

Accumulated evidence has shown the importance of Epstein-Barr virus in the
pathogenesis of various lymphomas. This study aimed to determine the prevalence
of Epstein-Barr virus expression and its effect on survival amongst diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases from two large tertiary care centres in Turkey with
a particular interest in identifying cases of 'Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL 
of the elderly'. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases diagnosed between 1999 and
2009 were retrieved and 340 cases were used to construct tissue microarrays. The 
presence of Epstein-Barr virus small ribonucleic acids was examined by in situ
hybridization using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER)
oligonucleotides. A total of 18 cases (5.3%) showed Epstein-Barr virus
expression. Twelve cases were classified as Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL of 
the elderly. Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL cases showed a significantly
inferior overall survival as compared with Epstein-Barr virus-negative cases (p <
0.001). In our study group Epstein-Barr virus expression is not prevalent in
DLBCLs. Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL of the elderly is also rare in the
Turkish population. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus, however, is associated
with poor prognosis.

Alcohol is one of the main causes of traffic accidents worldwide. With a
population of 70 million, 12 million vehicles, and 18 million drivers (16%
women), Turkey is one of the European countries that has a high incidence of road
traffic accidents.In accordance with Turkish laws, subjects were considered to be
positive when alcohol blood concentration exceeded 50 mg/100 mL. The objective of
the present study was to obtain reliable and comparable data about alcohol use in
traffic cases in Turkey. All cases are admitted to the emergency department at
Ege University Medical Faculty. The cases from police officers are described as
traffic control cases. Alcohol was detected in the blood of about 54.4% of the
traffic-related cases during October 2005 to March 2007. It has been observed
that, in 17.4% of the traffic accident cases, the blood alcohol level was 50
mg/dL or less, which is the legal limit in Turkey for car drivers. Alcohol
prevalence was 57.2% in male cases and 43.6% in female cases. In alcohol-positive
cases; the ratios for males were 1.73 times more frequent in traffic-related
cases. Prevalence data will help traffic safety professionals to adequately
allocate resources and plan future efforts in reducing drinking-and-driving
behavior and thereby reduce traffic accidents.

The clinical management of tumor patients is often strongly influenced by the
tumor grade. The presence of heterogeneity is well recognized in a variety of
tumors. Overall grade is based on highest grade area identified within a tumor.
Urothelial carcinoma often contains different histological grades within the same
tumor. This study investigates the impact of a combined grading system on the
reproducibility of papillary urothelial neoplasms. A set prepared for an earlier 
study consisting of ten cases of each category (papillary urothelial neoplasm of 
low malignant potential (PUNLMP), LGPUC, and HGPUC) was used. Agreement between
pairs of pathologists was evaluated using κ statistics for the combined scoring
system. Interobserver agreement was fair to substantial as reflected by κ values 
ranging from 0.24 to 0.74 (mean κ = 0.43). The combined scores of 2 and 3 which
included PUNLMP showed the lowest degree of agreement and when this category was 
excluded from the analysis, interobserver agreement increased significantly (mean
κ = 0.65; ranging from 0.43 to 0.92) in terms of combined scores of 4, 5, and 6. 
PUNLMP has been shown to be the least reproducible component of a combined
scoring system even among experienced observers. Exclusion of PUNLMP from grading
scheme seems to improve interobserver variability.

Lymphatic differentiation in classic Kaposi's sarcoma: patterns of D2-40
immunoexpression in the course of tumor progression.

The recent development of lymphatic endothelium-specific immuno-indicators has
given rise to research on the histogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), specifically
focusing on its lymphatic root and differentiation. D2-40 is a new lymphatic
marker that recognizes podoplanin and is easily applied to formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded human tissues. This study examined D2-40 immunoexpression in
178 classical KS lesions using immunohistochemical methods. D2-40
immunoexpression was also examined in 63 non-KS soft tissue lesions to test the
reliability of D2-40 monoclonal antibody in the pathological diagnosis of KS.
D2-40 immunoreactivity was detected at all of the KS lesions and in lymphangioma 
and nonneoplastic lymphatic endothelium. There was no significant relationship
between the extent of D2-40 staining and histopathological stage; however, there 
was a positive correlation between the staining intensity and histopathological
stage in KS cases. D2-40 immunoreactivity was detected at all histopathological
stages of KS and may be added to the routine immunohistochemical panel used for
the differential diagnosis of KS. Widespread D2-40 protein expression is evidence
of a lymphatic origin or the differentiation of neoplastic cells in KS, and D2-40
expression increases with tumor progression.

The current study was undertaken to investigate chromosomal and genetical
aberrations leading to overexpression of Topoisomerase-2α (TOP2α) and to reveal
the possible association of these aberrations with HER2/neu overexpression and
gene amplification, and to search for the relationship between TOP2α and HER2/neu
status with prognostical biomarkers in papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a
group of tumors with diverse molecular, chromosomal and clinical features.
Archival cases of papillary RCC obtained from Departments of Pathology of
Pamukkale, Ege and Dokuz Eylul Universities were studied in two groups (type 1
and type 2) each containing 20 cases. The level of TOP2α and HER2/neu expression 
by tumor cells were determined immunohistochemically. A multicolor FISH probe was
used to define both amplification of HER2/neu and TOP2α genes, and polysomy 17.
The ratio of cells expressing TOP2α in type 1 and type 2 papillary RCC were
24.29% and 6.89%, respectively. The difference was statistically significant
comparing the average or median values of groups separately (p = 0.002). The
expression levels of TOP2α and HER2/neu were also correlated. TOP2α and HER2/neu 
were co-amplified in both groups. Immunohistochemical expression was not observed
in 15 of 23 cases with HER2/neu amplification. The most frequent finding detected
by FISH method was polysomy of chromosome 17. We had contradictory results
compared with the findings reported in the limited numbers of literature. It
shows us that papillary RCC constitute a heterogenous group of tumors with
various cytogenetic features and morphological classification of these tumors may
not be compatible with their molecular characteristics.

Embryology, Antalya, Turkey. keremdirican@gmail.com

Dichlorvos is an organophosphorus insecticide that is used worldwide for pest
control in agriculture and household use. Vitamins C and E are potential
antioxidants protecting cells from oxidative stress. Vitamin C+vitamin E,
dichlorvos, a combination of vitamin C+vitamin E+dichlorvos, or corn oil
(control) were given to rats via oral gavage for 7 weeks. Body and testis
weights, sperm parameters, hormone levels, histo- and cytopathological changes in
testes were investigated at the end of 24 h and the 4th and 7th weeks
comparatively with the control group. Body and testis weights, sperm morphology, 
FSH, LH, and testosterone levels were decreased significantly at the end of 4th
and 7th weeks in the dichlorvos- and vitamins+dichlorvos-treated groups. A
statistically significant decline in sperm motility and testosterone levels
occurred by the end of 7th week in the dichlorvos- and
vitamins+dichlorvos-treated groups. Light and electron microscopy revealed
necrosis, edema and cellular damage in testicular tissues of the dichlorvos- and 
vitamins+dichlorvos-treated rats at the end of 4th and 7th weeks. In conclusion, 
dichlorvos caused subacute and subchronic reproductive toxicity, but vitamins did

In the present work, we investigated the effect of chronic haloperidol
administration on the number of striatal neurons in guinea pigs. For this
purpose, adult male guinea pigs were given daily injections of 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg of
haloperidol for 6 weeks. After treatment, the animals were anesthetized via brief
inhalation of ether, the brains were removed and the corpus striatum was
dissected. Then the tissues were processed and semi-thin sections were stained
with toluidine blue for stereological and histopathological evaluation. The
physical disector was used for measurements of nuclear height and numerical
density of striatal neurons and also to evaluate both normal and degenerated
neurons within the corpus striatum of treated animals and untreated controls. In 
the control group, the mean numerical density of neurons was calculated as 47.92 
cell/mm3 and the mean nuclear height as 3.58 µm. Mean densities of all (both
viable and degenerated) neurons were calculated to be 45.46 in the low-dose (p < 
0.01), 39.73 in the medium-dose (p < 0.001) and 30.31 cell/mm3 in the high-dose
group (p < 0.001). Mean densities of degenerated neurons in the low, medium and
high dose group were 30.72, 22.93 (p < 0.001) and 15.56 cell/mm3 (p < 0.001)
respectively. Mean nuclear heights were 2.804 (p < 0.0001), 2.78 (p < 0.0001) and
2.33 µm (p < 0.00001) in the low, medium and high dose group, respectively.

Left diaphragmatic eventration associated with ipsilateral pulmonary
sequestration and intrathoracic kidney in a fetus: reviewing the prenatal
diagnosis and etiopathogenesis.

The prenatal diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic eventration, pulmonary
extralobar sequestration and intrathoracic ectopic kidney in a single fetus is
not reported yet according to the pubmed. Congenital diaphragmatic eventration is
an abnormal elevation of the diaphragm. Differential diagnosis from hernia is
essential for the perinatal management. Extralobar sequestrations are usually
asymptomatic and detected incidentally. Intrathoracic kidney is an extremely rare
congenital anomaly. Genitourinary and cardiac anomalies should be searched as
common co-existing malformations. Besides prenatal ultrasound, fetal magnetic
resonance imaging has a substantial support in counselling the family, planning
the follow-up of the pregnancy and decision-making for the perinatal management.

Nasal polyposis (NP), a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airway, is a
subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs) and
their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are considered to play important roles in the
pathogenesis of nasal polyposis. The aim of the current study was to evaluate and
compare the levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8 and TIMP-2 in NP and CRS with normal
nasal mucosa by using immunohistochemistry. Twenty-five patients with NP and
fifteen patients with CRS underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. Diseased mucosal
samples were obtained from ethmoidal sinuses. Control nasal mucosa (n=10) was
obtained from inferior nasal turbinate. Immunohistochemistry for MMP-1, MMP-2,
MMP-8 and TIMP-2 was performed. The expression of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-8
significantly increased in NP and CRS compared with control (p<0.05). The
distribution of TIMP-2 was higher in CRS than control and NP respectively
(p<0.05). MMP-1 immunoreactivity was distributed in the extracellular matrix
whereas MMP-2, MMP-8 and TIMP-2 immunostaining was present in the epithelium,
submucosal glands, vascular endothelium and inflammatory cells in CRS and NP. We 
suggest that differences in histological features between CRS and NP might be
related to the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8 and their tissue inhibitor-2.

Cystic and hemorrhagic giant left atrial myxoma in a patient presenting with
exertional angina and dyspnea.

Myxomas are the most common type of primary cardiac tumors and are usually
localized in the atrium. The clinical features of the disease depend on the size,
location, mobility, and fragility of the mass. In our case report, we present a
38-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital with typical exertional
angina and dyspnea. Diagnosis of giant cystic/hemorrhagic atrial myxoma was
established after imaging modalities including echocardiography, angiography, and
radiology and the pathological evaluation of the mass. On the coronary
angiography, a significant feeding artery of the tumor originating from the right
coronary artery and the cystic/hemorrhagic appearance all raised the suspicion
for the presence of other cardiac masses. However, the pathological evaluation of
the mass was reported as consistent with myxoma, with many prominent cystic and
hemorrhagic fields and no evidence of malignancy. Since large intratumoral
hemorrhagic fields and the presence of a significant feeding artery secondary to 
tumor neovascularization were observed, we hypothesized that the remarkable
amount of blood flow from the coronary artery to the giant myxoma may result in a
kind of coronary steal phenomenon and typical anginal symptoms of the patient.

Predictive value of pathological and immunohistochemical parameters for axillary 
lymph node metastasis in breast carcinoma.

Yenidunya S(1), Bayrak R, Haltas H.

sibelyn@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: While several prognostic factors have been identified in
breast carcinoma, the clinical outcome remains hard to predict for individual
patients. Better predictive markers are needed to help guide difficult treatment 
decisions. Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is one of the most important
prognostic determinants in breast carcinoma; however, the reasons why tumors vary
in their capability to result in axillary metastasis remain unclear. Identifying 
breast carcinoma patients at risk for ALNM would improve treatment planning. This
study aimed to identify the factors associated with ALNM in breast carcinoma,
with particular emphasis on basal-like phenotype.
METHODS: Breast carcinoma patients (n = 210) who underwent breast conserving
surgery and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (level I and II) or modified
radical mastectomy were included in this study. Pathological and
immunohistochemical data including individual receptor/gene status was collected 
for analysis. The basal phenotype status was ascertained using the basal
cytokeratin markers CK5, CK14, CK17 and EGFR.
RESULTS: ALNM was found in 55% (n = 116) of the patients. On univariate analysis,
multicentric disease, large tumor size (>2 cm), vascular and lymphatic invasion, 
epithelial hyperplasia, necrosis, in situ carcinoma and perineural invasion were 
associated with higher risk for ALNM, whereas CK5, CK14, EGFR positivity and
basal-like tumor type were associated with lower risk. On multivariate analysis, 
CK5 positivity (OR 0.003, 95%CI 0.000-0.23, p = 0.009) and lymphatic/vascular
invasion (OR 17.94, 95%CI 4.78-67.30, p < 0.001) were found to be independent
predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the value of complete ALND has been questioned in invasive 
breast cancer patients, treatment decisions for breast carcinoma have been
influenced by many parameters, including lymph node status. Since histopathologic
characteristics and expression of biological markers varies among the same
histologic subtypes of breast carcinoma, specific clinical and histopathologic
features of the primary tumor and ALN status like sentinel node might be used to 
tailor the loco-regional and systemic treatment in different clinical settings.

and Research Hospital, Turkey.

Brucellosis is one of the most important zoonotic diseases. Several complications
may be seen during its clinical course. Here, we describe a patient who presented
with complaints of fatigue, malaise, and intensive lumbar pain. He had been
suffering from these complaints for nearly 1 month. It was learned that he lived 
in rural area, made and ate his own cheese. The Rose Bengal test was positive and
Brucella standard tube agglutination was positive at 1/320 titer. Pedro Pons'
sign, an osteoarticular complication of brucellosis, was revealed with the aid of
radiologic imaging. Osteoarticular involvement is common in the course of
brucellosis. Deformation in vertebrae formerly known as Pedro Pons' sign should
be thought in brucellosis patients suffering from lumbar pain.

A 25-year-old woman was seen for a painless subcutaneous mass of 2 years
duration. On excisional biopsy, a collapsed cystic structure lined by stratified,
ciliated, columnar epithelium was noted. These linning cells did not produce
mucin. Immunohistochemical staining for progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor 
and epithelial membrane antigen was positive, whereas it was negative for
carcinoembryonic antigen. Findings were consistent with cutaneous ciliated cyst
(CCC). CCCs are rare, predominantly occurring on the lower extremities of young
women. Most of them have been regarded as Mullerian remnants. A case of a CCC in 
the subcutaneous area is reported.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) of the urinary bladder is a very 
rare clinical entity. The association of such a tumor with urothelial carcinoma
is even more unusual. Differential diagnosis between coexisting two distinct
primary tumors and carcinosarcoma of the urinary bladder is very important as
both the treatment and prognosis vary widely. Herein, we report a case of an
MPNST with a concomitant in situ urothelial carcinoma in a 53-year-old man. To
our knowledge, this is the first documented case of MPNST of the bladder that is 
treated by transuretheral resection which is in contrast with the previous
reports that used cystectomy.

Xanthogranulomatous salpingitis as a rare pathologic aspect of chronic active
pelvic inflammatory disease.

Yener N(1), Ilter E, Midi A.

Author information:

neyerus@yahoo.com

Xanthogranulomatous salpingitis (XGS) is a rare form of chronic inflammation of
the fallopian tubes. A 41-year old woman with a history of secondary infertility 
for 2 years is presented. The patient underwent bilateral salpingooopherectomy
with presumptive diagnosis of adnexal mass with cystic component. Intraoperative 
pathology consultation was done. The diagnosis of bilateral XGS associated with
chronic active follicular salpingitis was made. XGS is reported to be caused by
an unsuccesfully treated pelvic inflammatory disease. Its association with
chronic active follicular salpingitis has not been previously reported. Chronic
active follicular salpingitis with xanthogranulomatous inflammation might give
the impression of a cystic adnexal mass with septations on preoperative pelvic
computed tomography. Frozen sections are necessary to rule out malignancy as done
in our case.

The sustained virologic response of nonresponder hepatitis C virus patients with 
retreatment.

Microbiology, Kocaeli, Turkey. silaakhan@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy remain the
first-line treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In contrast
to the large number of studies in treatment-naive patients, the effectiveness of 
retreatment in patients who have previously failed pegylated interferon based
therapy is not much reported.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to focus on the efficacy of
pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin in retreated chronic hepatitis C
patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were treated with pegylated interferon alpha
either 2a (180 μg) or 2b (1.5μg/kg) subcutaneously once weekly for a 48-week
period, plus ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day. The patient who had a negative HCV RNA
at the end of 48 weeks were followed up for 24 weeks, and the patients who
relapsed in the post-treatment follow-up period of 24 weeks were treated again
with pegylated interferon alpha; but if the first treatment was administered with
pegylated interferon alpha 2a, the second was administered with pegylated
interferon alpha 2b and if pegylated interferon alpha 2b, then the second with
pegylated interferon alpha 2a.
RESULTS: We evaluated the outcome of our patients with chronic HCV who achieved a
viral response at the end of the therapy, but did not achieve sustained virologic
response; 54% (38/70) of patients did achieve sustained virologic response, while
46% (32/70) of patients did not (eight patients did not achieve early virologic
response, five patients were nonresponders at 24th week of the treatment, the
remaining 19 patient had negative HCV at the end of the therapy but did not
achieve sustained virologic response). We began from 19 patients to 8 patients,
who had negative HCV RNA at the end of the treatment, but did not achieve
sustained virologic response, interferon plus ribavirin therapy again. If the
patient had interferon alpha 2a, we gave in the second tour alpha 2b; and if
alpha 2b, then alpha 2a. The early virologic response of these nine patients were
found to be 63% (5/8). These 5 patients who had rapid virologic response and
early virologic response at the second therapy achieved sustained virologic
response this time.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the standard 48-week treatment is
insufficient and that an extended course of treatment may be necessary. Relapse
is a poorly understood clinical outcome in the treatment of chronic HCV patients.
Retreatment can give a chance to some patients specially who have early virologic
response and negative HCV RNA at the end of the first therapy.

Enchondromatosis is a congenital nonhereditary condition characterized by
multiple symmetrically distributed intraosseous cartillaginous masses in the
metaphyses and diaphyses of bones. We report a case of bilateral multiple
enchondromas and cerebral hamartomas in an 11-year-old boy in whom x-rays
displayed distortion and expansion of bilateral long tubuler bones, hands and
feet, scapulas, pelvis, and occipital regions of the calvarium. In addition to
osseous abnormalities, bilateral cerebral hamartomas were observed on cranial
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
case in the literature with enchondromatosis and cerebral hamartomas.

Immunohistochemical COX-2 overexpression correlates with HER-2/neu overexpression
in invasive breast carcinomas: a pilot study.

Isparta, Turkey.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a prostaglandin synthase that catalyzes the synthesis
of prostaglandin G2 and H2. It has been shown that COX-2 plays an important role 
in tumorigenesis of different tumor types and it is thought to take part in
breast carcinogenesis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the
relationship of immunohistochemical COX-2 expression with clinicopathological
parameters, including HER-2/neu overexpression in invasive breast carcinoma
(IBC). Our study population comprised 10 normal breasts, 25 ductal carcinomas in 
situ (DCIS), and 51 invasive breast carcinomas. Immunohistochemical
overexpressions of COX-2 and HER-2/neu were investigated in sections of
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks by 3 observers. In normal breast, DCIS
and IBC, the COX-2 overexpression rate was 0%, 84%, and 58.8%, respectively. In
IBC, COX-2 overexpression had a significant relationship with HER-2/neu
overexpression (p=0.026) and a high histological grade (p=0.026). COX-2
expression in both DCIS (n=25) and IBC (n=51) was significantly higher than in
normal breast tissue (p<0.0001). In addition, the COX-2 expression rate was
significantly higher in DCIS than in IBC (p=0.042). Our results indicated that
COX-2 overexpression correlates with aggressive phenotypic features, such as
HER-2/neu overexpression and high histological grade in IBC. Increased expression
of COX-2 in both DCIS and IBC in comparison to normal breast could indicate a
role in breast carcinogenesis. COX-2 overexpression may provide a clinically
useful biomarker for estimating tumor aggressiveness.

DNA repair mechanisms in mammalian germ cells.

Ozturk S(1), Demir N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Akdeniz
University, Antalya, Turkey.

Mammalian germ cells encounter several types of DNA damage. This damage is almost
completely repaired in a short period of time to provide the maintenance of
genomic integrity. The main repair mechanisms operating in mammalian germline
cells are: nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), mismatch
repair (MMR), DNA double strand break repair (DSBR), and post replication repair 
(PRR). Currently, there are relatively few publications that summarize basic
information and new findings on DNA repair mechanisms used in mammalian germ
cells. In the present article, we review the studies that discuss repair
mechanisms operating in the female and male germ cells. We then survey some of
the recent discoveries made in this field.

Primary germ cell tumors may spread to the lung, liver, brain, and bone
hematogenously. However, spinal metastasis is extremely rare. A case with yolk
sac tumor (YST) and cauda equina metastasis was presented in a 2-year-old boy.
Two months prior to admisssion, he underwent left radical orchiectomy for
testicular YST. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
revealed spinal and cauda equina involvement. This is the first report of
metastasis of testicular YST to cauda equina in a child.

Correlation of E-cadherin, VEGF, COX-2 expression to prognostic parameters in
papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Erdem H(1), Gündogdu C, Sipal S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Duzce University of Medical Faculty, Duzce, Turkey.

Thyroid cancer represents approximately 1% of all human malignancies. papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant tumor of the thyroid gland, 
accounting for 70-80% of all thyroid cancers. In the US, the incidence of thyroid
cancer is 4 per 100,000 individuals. It is two to four times as frequent in women
as in men. The development of PTC is influenced by many factors including genetic
alterations, growth factors, and physical agents such as radiation. In order to
recognize the prognosis for PTC, a lot of clinic and pathological parameters such
as; age, tumor size, extra-thyroid tumor spread, lymph node, distant metastases, 
gender, tumor stage are used. As most of these parameters are subjective, more
objective and useful prognostic factors are needed for determining biologic
behavior, providing an initial assessment. In this study, we aimed to compare the
expressions of COX-2, E-cadherin, VEGF to classical prognostic factors, and to
investigate the correlation with prognosis. Operation records from 79 PTC cases
were examined retrospectively. In the study, we aimed to investigate the whole
tissue by means of stereology method, which is an impartial one, and we indicated
the expression COX-2, VEGF, E-cadherin immunohistochemically in 79 resection
diagnosed with PTC. We determined correlations between the expressions of COX-2
and VEGF, E-cadherin, and age, gender, and stage.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in
preoperative diagnosis of parakeratotic odontogenic keratocyst.
STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-three cases of odontogenic keratocyst which were evaluated
with FNAC prior to enucleation were included in the study. Aspiration smears were
stained with Papanicolaou and hematoxylin-eosin stain. Results obtained from FNAC
were compared with histopathologic data obtained from the excisional biopsies.
RESULTS: Keratotic cell clusters with or without inflammation were identified in 
all the cytologic smears. No dysplastic changes were seen. The evaluation of the 
excisional biopsies revealed cystic epithelium which is characterized by
palisaded basal cells, a corrugated surface with a lumen containing keratin
debris. Two of the cases which revealed satellite cysts were not associated with 
Gorlin-Goltz syndrome due to the absence of other findings.
CONCLUSION: Parakeratotic odontogenic keratocyst can be substantially diagnosed
preoperatively utilizing FNAC with a careful evaluation.

Histamine is an endogenous biogenic amine that is synthesized from the basic
amino acid histidine. Ability to mimic anaphylaxis is one of the first described 
functions of histamine and it has been demonstrated that histamine plays a
significant role in the regulation of immune system and neuronal function,
influences neuronal morphology and is involved in mast cells (MCs) chemotaxis.
MCs as histamine releasers, may thus also interact with neuronal function. In the
present study, we aimed to evaluate the role of histamine on mast cell density
and neuronal morphology in the gastrointestinal tract of the mouse. Ten mice were
daily injected intraperitoneally for 7 days with 20 mg/kg of histamine diluted in
0.5 ml physiological serum. After 7 days, mice were euthanised and samples from
stomach, small bowel, colon and appendix were processed for histological
examination. Immunohistochemistry was performed employing primary antibodies
directed against triptase for mast cells and PGP 9.5 antigen for neuronal
structures. The density of triptase and PGP 9.5 positive cells and the morphology
of the ganglia were quantitatively evaluated by digital image analysis. The
number of ganglia was higher in stomach, small bowel, colon and appendices of the
histamine group when compared with the control group. Only in appendices and
colon, the number of Schwann cells was significantly higher than that of the
control group. The PGP 9.5 expression and the mean area of ganglia showed a
significant increase only in appendices. In histamine group the MCs were
clustered especially in the lamina propria. Mast cell density (MCD) was
significantly higher than the control group in the small bowel, colon and
appendices tissues. The intraperitoneally injection histamine increases the MCD
and induces the neuronal hypertrophy and after the comparison of the organs in
the gastrointestinal tract the results indicated the most effected organ as the
appendices.

The searching of the reliable and repeatable immunohistochemical markers in the
differential diagnosis of the thyroid's differentiated follicular epithelial
neoplasms has been continuing. Recently, the studies have majored on
immunohistochemical markers such as high-molecular weight cytokeratin (HMW-CK),
galectin-3, cytokeratin 19, and p27. We aimed to evaluate the differences of the 
expressions of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), thyroid
transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), Ki-67, p63, p53, and HMW-CK among the papillary
thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), follicular carcinomas (FCs), and follicular adenomas
(FAs). Thirty-nine patients with the diagnoses of the PTC, FC, and FA in the
archives of the Izmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital Pathology Laboratory
registries in between 2004 and 2009 were included in the study.
Immunohistochemical stains for PCNA, TTF-1, Ki-67, p63, p53, and HMW-CK were
applied. The results were analyzed statistically by using Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 16.0 program (SPSS Inc., IBM, Somers, New 
York, USA). In all 3 groups, all tumors showed PCNA and TTF-1 positivity. Ki-67
proliferation index varied in a wide range in all groups. Although it was not
statistically significant, 19 of 39 tumors (7 PTCs, 2 FCs, and 10 FAs) were
stained with p63. The results of the immunoreactivity seen in PTCs with p53
(41.2%) and HMW-CK (52.9%) were statistically significant. The tumors in the
other 2 groups (FC and FA) showed no reactivity with HMW-CK. Although the
differential diagnosis of the thyroid follicular neoplasms are based on the
histologic and cytomorphological criteria, p53 and HMW-CK positivity might be
undertaken in favor of the diagnosis of the PTC.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ellagic acid (EA) has
protective effect on adriamycin (ADR)-induced testicular and spermatozoal
toxicity associated with the oxidative stress in male rats. Thirthy-two healthy
8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups. The
first (EA) group was treated with EA (2 mg/kg/every other day) by gavage. The
second (ADR) group received ADR (2 mg/kg/once a week) intraperitoneally, while
the combination of ADR and EA was given to the third (ADR+EA) group. The forth
(control) group was treated with placebo. At the end of the 8-week treatment
period, reproductive organ weights, epididymal sperm parameters,
histopathological changes and apoptosis via Bax and Bcl-2 proteins, testicular
tissue lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activities, were investigated. 
ADR administration was determined to cause significant decreases in reproductive 
organ weights, epididymal sperm concentration and motility, plasma testosterone
concentration, diameter of seminiferous tubules, germinal cell layer thickness,
Johnsen's testicular score and Bcl-2 positive antiapoptotic cell rate, wherease
it caused significant increases in level of lipid peroxidation and glutathione,
catalase activity, abnormal sperm rates and Bax positive apoptotic cell rates
along with degeneration, necrosis, immature germ cells, congestion and atrophy in
testicular tissue when compared with the control group. EA administration to
ADR-treated rats provided significant improvements in ADR-induced disturbed
oxidant/antioxidant balance, decreased testosterone concentration, testicular
apoptosis and mild improvements in the histopathological view of the testicular
tissue. However, EA failed to improve decreased reproductive organ weights and
deteriorated sperm parameters due to ADR administration. It is concluded that
while ADR has direct or indirect (lipid peroxidation) negative effects on sperm
structure and testicular apoptosis in rats, EA has protective effects on
ADR-induced testicular lipid peroxidation and apoptosis.

Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) are low molecular weight
cytokeratins. The expressions of CK7 and CK20 have been studied in various
primary and metastatic carcinomas. Their expression patterns may help to
distinguish the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. We investigated the
expressions of CK7 and CK20 in 196 cases of colorectal carcinoma. Paraffin
sections of 196 colonic adenocarcinomas were randomly selected, retrieved, and
immunostained for CK7 and CK20 with a standard avidin-biotin complex method. CK7 
was expressed in 34/196 (17.3%) and CK20 in 159/196 (81.1) cases of colorectal
adenocarcinoma. CK7-/CK20+ had the greatest proportion (65.8%) in colorectal
carcinomas. The CK7+/CK20+ immunophenotype was identified in 30/196 (15.3%),
CK7-/CK20- in 33/196 (16.9%), and CK7+/CK20- in 4/196 (2%) colon adenocarcinomas.
The CK7 and CK20 expression patterns were different in colorectal carcinomas
according to histological grade, location of the tumor, and lymph node
metastasis. CK20 positivity was more common in low grade carcinomas than in high 
grade carcinomas (85.1% versus 47.6%) and in rectal and sigmoid carcinomas than
in proximal colon carcinomas (88.2% versus 63.2% and 88.9% versus 63.2%,
respectively). Furthermore, CK7 expression was more common in tumors with lymph
node metastasis than in non-metastatic tumors (25.3% versus 11%). In conclusion, 
a considerable number of colorectal carcinomas showed reactivity to CK7 (17.3%)
or no reactivity to CK20 (18.9%). Therefore, CK7 positivity or CK20 negativity
does not rule out a colorectal origin of metastatic carcinoma.

fluorescence in situ hybridization in central PNETs and Ewing's sarcoma family of
tumors.

Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) are indicated by malignant, small, round
and blue cell tumors of the bone and soft tissue. Gene rearrangements between EWS
gene on chromosome 22q12 and members of the ETS gene family are common in and
specific to ESFTs. Another defining characteristic of ESFTs is their membranous
expression of the CD99. In contrast, such translocations and immunoreactivity are
not found in central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (cPNETs). The aim of this
study was to investigate the detection of EWS/FLI1 translocations and CD99
immunoreactivity in order to evaluate their clinicopathological features and
their roles in the differential diagnosis of these tumors. In this study, we
investigated CD99 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemistry and Ewing's sarcoma
/ Friend leukaemia virus integration 1 (EWS/FLI1) translocation using the
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method in 23 cases. CD99 expression was
detected in 10/11 (90%) ESFT cases and 2/7 cPNET cases. In 18 cases EWS/FLI1
translocation was examined using the FISH method. The EWS/FLI1 translocations
were detected in 7/8 (87.5%) ESFTs cases, whereas non of 8 cPNET cases were
detected with this translocation. One case could not be classified as either
central or peripheral, showed EWS/FLI1 translocation. There was a statistically
significant difference in CD99 expression (p = 0.0013) and EWS/FLI1 translocation
(p = 0,002) between cPNETs and ESFTs cases. In conclusion, CD99 expression and
EWS/FLI1 translocation are specific and sensitive markers in the diagnosis of
ESFTs. However, these were often not found in cases of cPNET. Therefore, in the
diagnosis of ESFTs, clinical, radiological, histopathological and
immunohistochemical parameters should always be evaluated together.

This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of caffeic acid
phenethyl ester on carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in rats. Twenty-four
male Wistar rats were divided in three groups. Group I was used as control. Rats 
in group II were injected with carbon tetrachloride every other day for 1 month, 
whereas rats in group III were injected with carbon tetrachloride and caffeic
acid phenethyl ester every other day for 1 month. At the end of the experiment,
all animals were killed by decapitation and their livers were removed. Liver
tissues were processed for electron microscopy. Histopathologically, hepatocytes 
of rats treated with carbon tetrachloride had damage in the cytoplasmic
organelles and nuclei membranes as well as an excessive lipid accumulation in the
hepatocytes. However, those histopathological changes were reduced with the
coadministration of carbon tetrachloride and caffeic acid phenethyl ester. We
conclude that caffeic acid phenethyl ester treatment has the capability to
prevent carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in rats.

Secondary syphilis with an interstitial granuloma annulare-like histopathologic
pattern.

A granulomatous tissue response may be observed in untreated, long-standing
lesions of secondary syphilis. In addition to poorly defined granulomatous
inflammation, leprosy-like sarcoidal and palisaded granulomatous inflammation has
been documented in literature reports of lues. Herein, we report a 47-year-old
man who presented with a 3-month history of a generalized non-pruritic macular
and papular rash located on the trunk and extremities. Histopathologically, there
was an interstitial arrangement of histiocytes with occasional multinucleated
giant cells positioned among collagen bundles without associated necrosis,
thereby closely mimicking interstitial granuloma annulare. A clue to the
diagnosis was the presence of admixed plasma cells. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first reported case of secondary syphilis showing an interstitial
granulomatous pattern mimicking interstitial granuloma annulare.

(1)Department of Pathology, Veterinary Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul,
Turkey. kivilcim@istanbul.edu.tr

The aim of the present study was to develop an immunocytochemical procedure for
the early detection and demonstration of Rhodococcus equi in smears of tracheal
aspirates taken from live foals in field conditions. Tracheal wash samples were
collected from thoroughbred foals, aged 1-5 months and located in studs around
Bursa and Istanbul, Turkey. Some foals were suspected of having R. equi infection
on the basis of clinical examination (n=56) and others were unaffected control
animals (n=54). Serum samples were also collected from each foal for testing for 
the presence of R. equi-specific antibody by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). Thirty-six of the control foals (66.7%) and 37 of the affected foals
(66.1%) were seropositive for R. equi. Immunocytochemical labelling was detected 
in the smears from 73.2% of the affected foals and 70.4% of the control foals.
For both ELISA and immunocytochemistry (ICC), there was no significant difference
between the affected and control foals (P>0.05) and there was no significant
difference between the two test modalities (P>0.05). ICC may therefore have
similar diagnostic utility when compared with ELISA. There is no clear
relationship between clinical signs and ELISA or ICC positivity.

CD10 for the distinct differential diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma and benign
tumours of cutaneous appendages originating from hair follicle.

Sengul D(1), Sengul I, Astarci MH, Ustun H, Mocan G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Prof. Dr. A. Ilhan Ozdemir State Hospital, Giresun,
Turkey.

AIMS: Differential diagnosis between the group of trichoadenoma,
trichofolliculoma, trichoepithelioma, trichoblastoma and basal cell carcinoma has
been creating some difficulties for the pathologist and the clinicians,
particularly in the presence of small specimens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 30 cases of benign tumours of cutaneous
appendages originating from the hair follicle and 30 cases of basal cell
carcinoma were retrieved from the archives deposited from 2004 to 2008.
RESULTS: The expression of CD10 in both tumours was graded from [0] to [2+] for
each case. The immunoreactivity of CD10 was comparatively examined among the
groups and each subgroup. The stromal CD10 immunopositivity of benign tumours of 
cutaneous appendages originating from the hair follicle was stronger than the
other (p = 0.003) regarding both the numerical and the degree of expression.
However, peripheral CD10 of basal cell carcinoma was stronger than the other for 
[1+] immunopositivity (p = 0.03). It was exact opposite for [2+] (p = 0.013).
Besides, central CD10 immunopositivity and CD10 reactivity for the subgroups was 
not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: CD10 may be very useful for the differential diagnosis between them 
particularly in the small and superficial biopsies and it may be even a
life-saving method in some selected cases.

Expression of plakophilins (PKP1, PKP2, and PKP3) in gastric cancers.

Demirag GG(1), Sullu Y, Gurgenyatagi D, Okumus NO, Yucel I.

Author information: 
(1)Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology,
Samsun, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The importance of cell-cell junction proteins (including armadillo
proteins) in tumor biology is known, but limited with regard to plakophilins. We 
explored the relationship between plakophilins (PKP1, PKP2, PKP3) to gastric
cancer via immunohistochemical techniques.
METHODS: We compared the immunohistochemistry of PKPs in 34 gastric
adenocarcinomas and 20 normal gastric tissues.
RESULTS: In gastric cancer, PKP1 expression was unchanged but PKP2 and PKP3 were 
significantly decreased as compared to normal controls. There was no observable
clinical association with PKP1 or PKP2 expression; however, low PKP3 level and
poor prognosis appeared to correlate with regards to node number and tumor stage.
The mean disease-free survival (DFS) was 38 ± 3 months (range: 32 - 44) and mean 
overall survival (OS) 42 ± 4 months (range: 38 - 50). Decreased PKP2 appeared to 
negatively impact DFS.
CONCLUSION: Decreased PKP2 and PKP3 may be early prognostic markers and loss of
PKP3 expression during gastric carcinoma progression may indicate an invasive
phenotype.

OBJECTIVE: We report a rare case of calcifying pseudoneoplasm in the foramen
magnum. A large variety of tumors can be found in the foramen magnum;
meningiomas, neurofibromas, chordomas, chondrosarcomas and metastases are among
those that have been reported. Based on the histopathological structure of the
tumor, radical excision or, in the case of tumors with good behavioral pattern,
only decompressive debulking can be applied, in an effort to avoid unnecessary
morbidities. Thus, it is important to know the nature of the tumor before
planning the surgery.
CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old man with a 1-year history of pain on the left side of 
his face was admitted to our service. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a
calcific mass at the left side of the spinal cord at the level of the foramen
magnum. Median suboccipital craniectomy and total tumor resection were performed 
and there was no additional neurological deficit postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: We report, to our knowledge, the second case of a calcifying
pseudoneoplasm of the foramen magnum. We emphasize that these tumors are
pathologically benign and do not require aggressive surgical treatment and
suggest that asymptomatic cases can be followed radiologically.

A case of papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal cyst without a carcinoma in the
thyroid gland.

The thyroglossal duct cyst is the most common developmental anomaly of the
thyroid gland. We present a patient with a papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed 
after surgical resection of a thyroglossal cyst. The 39-year-old patient reported
to our hospital due to a swelling of this throat. The results of the
ultrasonography were reported as showing multiple nodules in both thyroid lobes, 
and an ~3-cm diameter image in the submental area, in keeping with
lymphadenomegalia. In the fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) evaluation from 
the nodules in the thyroid, it was observed that the thyrocites with uniform
nuclei made up single-layer groups. FNAC from the thyroglossal cyst, a few
histiocytes were observed on a ground with a large number of erythrocytes. The
patient was subjected to a total thyroidectomy, pyramidal lobe excision, and
total excision of the 3-cm diameter soft mass, starting at the tip of the
pyramidal lobe. The case was diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma in
thyroglossal duct cyst with histopathological and immunohistochemical findings.
If the thyroglossal channel cyst had been diagnosed preoperatively, total
thyroidectomy and a Sistrunk operation would have been performed. For this
reason, repeated FNAC, particularly, if performed under ultrasound guidance, may 
improve the diagnostic value of FNAC. Thus, in such patients, throat
ultrasonography must be carried out in expert hands, thin-needle aspiration
biopsy, computerized tomography, and thyroid scintigraphy must be done if
necessary, and the necessary treatment protocols carried out after a definite
diagnosis.

Although doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent its clinical
use is restricted due to its organ toxicities. The present investigation relates 
to reducing DOX induced side effects to the liver, kidney and ileum by usage of
the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent, resveratrol (RES) and to investigate
the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the process. Wistar rats were divided 
into four groups: control (saline i.p); DOX (20 mg/kg i.p), RES (20 mg/kg i.p)
and DOX (20mg/kg i.p)+RES (20 mg/kg i.p). Immunohistochemical activity of both
iNOS and eNOS were evaluated after DOX treatment and ultrastructural changes such
as cellular damage and mitochondrial degeneration were evaluated. Degenerative
ultrastructural changes were demonstrated especially in the DOX treated group.
Variations in biochemical marker levels of oxidative stress on ischemia in
tissues were not observed. Our data indicate that RES may prevent cellular damage
in the early phase of DOX induced toxicity. RES could be used with its beneficial
effects during early cellular damage in organ toxicity after DOX treatment in
cancer patients.

Significance of peritoneal washing cytopathology in ovarian carcinomas and tumors
of low malignant potential: a quality control study with literature review.

OBJECTIVE: The author evaluated a consecutive group of peritoneal washings (PWs) 
performed in the evaluation of adnexal masses to determine whether the
conventional histopathologic prognostic parameters significantly affect the tumor
detection rate using this procedure.
STUDY DESIGN: Cytopathologic reports from all PWs performed over a 13-year
(1996-2008) period in the evaluation of malignant and borderline ovarian tumors
were reviewed and correlated with those of the synchronously obtained
histopathologic specimens. Tumors of low malignant potential (LMP) were separated
for analysis. Statistical significance was determined using the χ2 test.
RESULTS: In the study, a total of 134 PWs were associated with primary epithelial
malignant tumors (n=114) or tumors of LMP (n=20) involving the ovary. The
positive PW cytopathology rates for clear cell (83.3%), undifferentiated (80.0%),
and serous carcinomas (65.7%) were higher than the overall average positive rate 
(62.3%) for all histopathologic subtypes. In contrast, endometrioid (41.2%) and
mucinous (45.5%) carcinomas had markedly lower cytopathology-positive rates than 
the overall average positive rate (p=0.118). As expected, PWs were found to be
significantly more likely to yield malignant cells in higher-grade (grades
II+III, 71.1%, p=0.002) and higher-stage (stages III+IV) tumors (76.6%, p=0.000) 
than in lower-grade (grade I, 38.7%) and lower-stage (stages I+II) tumors (32.4%)
and also in tumors with lymph node involvement (72.7%, p=0.021) than in tumors
without lymph node involvement (46.7%) and in bilateral tumors (74.6%, p=0.004)
than in unilateral tumors (42.9%). The positive cytopathology rates for the PWs
of the corresponding primary ovarian carcinomas with prominent pleomorphism
(81.0%, p=0.007), with high mitotic score (80.0%, p=0.006) and solid architecture
(72.9%, p=0.122) were also higher than the overall average positive rate. The
overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative
predictive value (NPV) and efficiency for the ovarian carcinoma (n=114) cases
were 72.3, 85, 95.8, 39.5 and 74.6%, respectively. The positive cytopathology
rate for the PWs of the serous tumors of LMP (7.1%) was higher than that of the
mucinous tumors of LMP (0.0%) and the overall average positive cytopathology rate
(5.0%) for the ovarian tumors with LMP. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, 
PPV, NPV, and efficiency for tumors of LMP were 33.3, 100, 100, 89.5, and 90%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: PW cytopathology results correlate significantly with almost all of
the conventional histopathologic prognostic parameters and the
cyto-histomorphologic parameters of the corresponding primary ovarian carcinomas.
The positive cytopathology rates also differ according to the histopathologic
subtypes. False negativity and 'false positivity?' was significantly correlated
with tumor grade.

Patients with hypothyroidism are considered to have an increased risk of
developing atherosclerosis. Uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase from 
tetrahyrobiopterin, an essential cofactor, leads to the decrease of nitric oxide 
production and increase in reactive oxygen species. Both mechanisms contribute to
atherosclerotic vascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether hypothyroidism influences the systemic redox-state and the structure of
aortic vascular endothelium in thyroidectomized rats. Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley
rats were randomly assigned to two groups; sham thyroidectomy and near-total
thyroidectomy. Three weeks after surgery, nitric oxide in plasma, homocysteine,
cysteine, glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity were measured in
serum, and biopterine and creatinine were measured in urine. Aortic endothelium
samples were processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. Although
superoxide dismutase activity remained constant, urine biopterin levels and serum
nitric oxide levels decreased in hypothyroid rats compared to their euthyroid
controls. Aortic endothelium showed early features of atherosclerosis, and
transmission electron microscopy revealed budding of caveolae in endothelial
cells. It is concluded that hypothyroidism might lead to systemic oxidative
stress with resultant endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent occurrence of
atherosclerosis.

A case of intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) with histological features of a
lipoleiomyoma (intravenous lipoleiomyoma) in a 48-year-old woman is reported. The
patient, with the tumor located in the uterus and extended up on the right side
of the heart through the inferior vena cava, was diagnosed as having a cardiac
mass. She displayed symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain due to the cardiac mass, as
well as pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. She underwent cardiac surgery because of a 
right atrial mass, and the histopathological diagnosis was leiomyoma without the 
knowledge of a uterine mass. Afterwards, a right adnexial mass was detected in
the pelvis, and a total hysterectomy-bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was
performed for the adnexial mass, which was also diagnosed as leiomyoma. In this
case report, we describe an intravenous lipoleiomyomatosis of the uterus which,
at the initial clinical presentation, showed cardiovascular symptoms. We
emphasize the histopathological features and the differential diagnosis of this
rare tumor in the light of the literature.

Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors: synchronous uterine
tumors resembling ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors and ovarian sex cord tumor.

Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (UTROSCTs) are very
rare. In this article, we present 3 cases that manifest classical
histomorphological features alongside diverse immunohistochemical findings. As a 
distinctive finding, one of the patients had UTROSCT in the uterus and an ovarian
sex cord tumor, called granulosa cell tumor, in the left ovary, simultaneously.
Problems in diagnosing such pathologic condition generally arise because of the
variable histologic picture of UTROSCT and may cause problems for general and
other nongynecologic surgical pathologists. Immunohistochemically, these tumors
express different markers that indicate their polyphenotypic origins.

Papillary apocrine metaplasia and columnar cell lesion with atypia: is there a
shared common pathway?

Kosemehmetoglu K(1), Guler G.

Author information: 
(1)Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Ankara,
Turkey. dokemal@hotmail.com

Papillary apocrine metaplasia (PAM) and columnar cell lesion with atypia (CCL)
are considered as candidates of early premalignant breast lesions. In this study,
we investigated their relationship at the morphological level, as we noticed
their histologic coexistence and proximity in daily routine. We selected 93
neoplastic and nonneoplastic cases with both PAM and CCL among 477 breast
specimens and reevaluated sections by measuring the distance between these
lesions. Ninety-three (19.4%) of 477 breast specimens contained both PAM and CCL;
in 73.1% of the cases, the 2 lesions were in continuity with or adjacent to each 
other. Lesions less distant than 1 mm are grouped as "adjoining lesions"; and the
rest, as "distant lesions." A significant difference (P = .006) was found between
adjoining ("zero" + "<1 mm") and distant ("≥ 1 mm") lesions; that is, PAM and CCL
were much closer in the neoplastic group, especially tumors with low grade, high 
estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, and less lymph node metastasis.
During the detailed examination of adjoining lesions, some "hybrid cells" showing
properties of both lesions were encountered. Papillary apocrine metaplasia and
CCL tend to appear in close contact, especially in neoplastic breasts with
favorable features. This result implies that PAM and CCL may be included in the
same pathogenetic pathway despite their distinct immunophenotypical properties.

AIM: the aim of this study was to investigate the pathologic features,
proliferation potential and expression of some anti-apoptotic and
growth-promoting markers in adult medulloblastomas.
METHOD: we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of survivin, c-KIT, Bcl-2,
fascin, p-53 and Ki-67 in 18 adult medulloblastomas (> 16 years of age).
RESULTS: study included 14 males and 4 females (mean age: 22.9 ± 8.2). 14 cases
were classical, 2 desmoplastic/nodular and 2 large cell medulloblastomas.
Moderate-to-high nuclear survivin expression was observed with high percentages
(55 - 100%) in all medulloblastomas while Bcl-2 was mildly positive in only 1
case. Interestingly, mild-to-moderate cytoplasmic c-KIT expression was
demonstrated in 16 cases (89%) without membranous accentuation. Fascin expression
was observed in 13 medulloblastomas (72%), 9 of which showing moderate to high
immunoreactivity. Mild p53 expression was present in only 4 cases (22%). Mean
Ki-67 index was 20.6% (range 8 - 55%).
CONCLUSION: frequent nuclear survivin expression implies the predominance of
anti-apoptotic factors in pathogenesis of adult medulloblastomas. It may also be 
a potential therapeutic target for adult medulloblastomas. Although Blc-2
immunoreactivity was previously reported in approximately 30% in
medulloblastomas, we have observed that it is rarely expressed in the present
series of adult medulloblastomas. To our knowledge, this is the first study
evaluating fascin expression in medulloblastomas. Its presence may be related to 
the neuronal differentiation. Mild-to-moderate cytoplasmic c-KIT immunoreactivity
without membranous staining in adult medulloblastomas may support the previous
studies reporting low level of c-KIT protein expression with lack of activating
mutations in medulloblastomas. It seems p53 is rarely involved in the course of
develepment of adult medulloblastomas.

BACKGROUND: Chondroid syringoma is a benign skin adnexal tumor. The reported
incidence of chondroid syringoma among primary skin tumors is low and has been
reported at 0.01-0.098%.
CASE: A 57-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of a slowly growing
lump on her philtrum. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed. The smears
showed cohesive groups of round cells embedded in a chondromyxoid ground
substance. A diagnosis of benign appendageal tumor of the skin was made. Surgical
excision of tumor was done. Histopathologic examination was consistent with
chondroid syringoma.
CONCLUSION: Chondroid syringoma should be included in the differential diagnosis 
of a slowly growing nodule on the head or neck. The diagnosis can be confirmed by
means of fine needle aspiration cytology. The treatment of choice is local
excision.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Sarcomatoid or spindle cell carcinomas are rare malignancies which
are considered as a poorly differentiated variant of squamous cell carcinoma.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a wide variety of malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the expression of EBV latent membrane
protein-1 (LMP-1) and EBV EBNA-2 as well as the immunohistochemical profile of
AE-1/AE-3, vimentin, desmin, CK 5-6, smooth muscle actin (SMA), p63, S-100, p53
and CD-117 with the clinicopathological correlation of eight patients of
sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) in the upper aerodigestive tract.
RESULTS: Four cases showed EBV LMP-1 positivity (50%) and there was no EBV EBNA-2
positivity. However, the EBV LMP-1 results of our series could be considered only
as a coincidental finding in the SCs of the upper aerodigestive tract.
CONCLUSIONS: This finding supports the idea that further studies based on larger 
series might be helpful enlighting the role played by EBV in carcinogenesis of
SC.

Tanyeri H.

University, Istanbul, Turkey. sertanergun@gmail.com

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess oxidative stress and antioxidant
profile in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) using serum and salivary
samples and to compare these biomarkers in a group of healthy subjects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one recently diagnosed patients with OLP and 20
healthy controls with matched periodontal status were recruited to the study.
Total antioxidant activity (TAA) and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde
(MDA) in both serum and saliva were determined. Univariate comparisons between
the two groups were made for quantitative and categorical variables to determine 
any significant differences.
RESULTS: In OLP patients, total antioxidant defense (TAA) was significantly lower
than that in healthy subjects in their serum samples (P = 0.01). Salivary MDA
levels were significantly higher in the OLP group compared with healthy subjects 
(P = 0.03). A significant correlation was found between serum and saliva TAA
estimates in patients with OLP (r = 0.714 and P = 0.0001) and in the control
group (r = 0.69 and P = 0.001). Significant correlation was also found between
serum and saliva MDA values in control group (r = 0.464 and P = 0.04). A
significant inverse correlation was found between salivary MDA and TAA values in 
the control group (r = -0.598 and P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest an increased oxidative stress and
imbalance in the antioxidant defense system in biological fluids of patients with
OLP. These findings may reflect the disease phenomenon of OLP rather than a
causal effect and their role in pathogenesis and transformation of OLP to cancer,
if any, needs further elucidation.

Cardiac valvular tumors are very infrequent lesions constituting about 10% of the
primary cardiac neoplasms. Among the valvular tumors, lipomatous hamartoma
represents a very rare and distinct pathological entity. Retrieval of the
literature reveals only eight reported cases, and there is lack of information
regarding their clinical features. Herein, we describe a patient with a mass on
the tricuspid valve detected incidentally and diagnosed to be a "lipomatous
hamartoma." To obtain a better understanding of the nature of these unusual
lesions, we reviewed the literature and presented their clinicoanatomical
characteristics together with diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

The aim of this study which was structured with the objective of determination of
the optimum protective therapy against the long term NSAID therapy-induced ulcers
was to compare the gastro-protective effects of various antiulcer drugs
(ranitidine, omeprazole, bismuth and misoprostol) alone or in combination with
each other in different doses on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rats. In 
this experimental study the protective effect of misoprostol (100 μg/kg/day and
10 μg/kg/day i.g.), omeprazole (5 mg/kg/day and 1.5 mg/kg/day i.p.), ranitidine
(40 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day i.p.), bismuth (70 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day
i.g.), combinations of misoprostol (10 μg/kg/day i.g.) plus omeprazole
(1.5mg/kg/day i.p.) and misoprostol (10 μg/kg/day i.g.) plus ranitidine (10
mg/kg/day i.p.) are investigated on indomethacin (50 mg/kg/day s.c.) induced
gastric ulcers. Half an hour before indomethacin administration, each group
received the above treatment regimens for 5 days. After 5-day treatment, the rats
were sacrificed and histopathological and hematological examinations were
performed. The following regimens were found to be effective in the prevention of
indomethacin-induced gastric lesions: 100 μg/kg misoprostol, 10 μg/kg
misoprostol, 5mg/kg omeprazole, combination of 10 μg/kg misoprostol plus 1.5
mg/kg omeprazole and 10 μg/kg misoprostol plus 10 mg/kg ranitidine. The
prevention rates achieved by these treatments were 71.4%, 50%, 47.6%, 52.4% and
50%, respectively. As a result of this study, misoprostol and omeprazol were
found to be effective in protection against NSAID-induced gastric problems;
while, ranitidine and bismuth were not. Also, the combinations of these agents
were not found to have additive or synergistic effects.

Intestinal Langerhans cell histiocytosis-like lesion in an adult presented with
diverticulitis: a reactive or neoplastic condition?

Temel Bilimler Binası, Capa, Istanbul, Turkey, ozgurmete77@gmail.com.

The involvement of the gut by Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is very rare in
adults; however this is usually observed with a disseminated disease in children.
We report a 75-year-old male patient who underwent right hemicolectomy for a
complicated intestinal diverticular disease. The surgical specimen revealed
LCH-like proliferative lesion associated with diverticulitis. The overall
morphological and immunohistochemical findings are indistinguishable from LCH.
Systemic scans and subsequently performed bone marrow biopsies were free of
disease. Although the HUMARA clonality assay cannot be assessed, the lack of
evidence of LCH progression or disease elsewhere in the whole body strongly
supported the possibility of an atypical reactive phenomenon probably due to the 
underlying intestinal diverticular disease. Therefore, it is important to avoid
diagnosing such a unifocal Langerhans cell proliferation as LCH in patients with 
underlying pathologies in the absence of systemic involvement. Therefore, without
knowledge of clonal status of a unifocal Langerhans cell proliferation, we
recommend using the terminology of LCH-like lesion.

Spindle cell tumors of the prostate are rare and mostly primary. We report a case
of retroperitoneal sarcoma, which is a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma involving
the prostate secondarily by metastasis. The patient was a 44-year-old man who
presented with progressing abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed a large
retroperitoneal mass. The patient underwent surgical resection. Intraoperatively,
a second smaller mass was identified in the pelvis and was left untouched. The
resected retroperitoneal specimen and prostate transrectal needle biopsies taken 
afterward showed the same mesenchymal tumor. Radical cystoprostatectomy was
performed. Metatatic tumor involving the prostate, bilateral seminal vesicles,
and base of the urinary bladder was found. Microscopic examination revealed
typical histomorphologic features of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. The patient
is without evidence of disease 3 years postoperatively. This case is the first
documentation of metastatic sarcoma to the prostate and expands the list of
malignant mesenchymal neoplasms that may involve this organ.

Biliary papillomatosis and papillary carcinoma are rare tumors of biliary tract; 
and because of their morphologic similarities, papillomatosis-papillary carcinoma
sequel has been proposed. We report an unusual case of polypoid minimally
invasive papillary carcinoma located at the junction between cystic and common
bile ducts, complicated with biliary papillomatosis of gallbladder and cystic
duct, showing focal areas of malignant change. Intrahepatic ducts, hepatic ducts,
and distal common bile duct were spared. Both papillomatosis and papillary
carcinoma showed areas of high p53 and p21 expression with high proliferative
index. Patient is still alive for 4 years without evidence of disease after
modified Whipple operation. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms are further
discussed.

Vacuolated cell pattern of pancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma: a clinicopathological

important in the differential diagnosis.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDCA) is characterized by well-defined tubular 
units in the vast majority of the cases; however, variations in this theme do
occur. It is important to recognize the morphologic spectrum of PDCA to avoid
misdiagnosis especially in small specimens and also in metastatic foci. Here, we 
document a morphologic variant of PDCA that is characterized by a distinctive
pattern of infiltrating cribriform nests in a distinctive "microcystic" or
"secretory" pattern. Twenty-four cases of PDCA have been identified in a review
of 505 cases diagnosed with PDCA. Histologically, this pattern was characterized 
by infiltrating nests of tumor cells with large vacuoles and "signet-ring" like
appearance imparting a cribriform growth pattern. The vacuoles were one to five
cells in size, often merging to form multilocular spaces separated by a thin rim 
of cell membrane. Many of these spaces contained CA19.9 positive granular
secretory material. The nuclei were often pushed to the periphery and compressed 
in a pattern resembling adipocytes, although the nuclei were often densely
hyperchromatic and displayed significant atypia. Especially in biopsies from the 
peripancreatic fat and peritoneum, these neoplastic cells had been misdiagnosed
as degenerating adipocytes, and in the lymph nodes, they had been misinterpreted 
as lipogranulomas. Clinical findings of the patients were similar to that of
conventional PDCA, except higher incidence of history of smoking (83% vs. 60%;
p=0.034). In conclusion, vacuolated cell adenocarcinoma is a distinct morphologic
variant of PDCA, and the presence of this peculiar pattern in a metastatic site, 
although not specific, should raise the suspicion of a PDCA.

AIM: The combination of smoking and drinking alcohol has a high association with 
diseases of squamous epithelium within the human oral cavity. Therefore, a study 
was done to assess the impact of these agents alone or in combination on the
squamous epithelium using as model the buccal epithelium from rabbit oral cavity.
METHODS: Buccal epithelium was mounted in Ussing chambers to monitor electrical
parameters during exposure to ethanol (5-40%) or to Ringer extract of cigarette
smoke (EOCS) from one to six cigarettes dissolved in 10 ml Ringer either alone or
with combination.
RESULTS: Exposure to EOCS reduced in a dose dependent manner above 2
cigarettes/10 ml transmural electrical potential difference (PD), short-circuit
current (I(sc)), increased transmural electrical resistance (R). Morphology
showed from generalize tissue edema to patchy necrosis with the increasing
concentrations. Ethanol alone raised PD, I(sc) and R at lower concentrations (5%)
and lowered PD, I(sc) and R at higher concentrations (40%). The combination of 5%
ethanol, EOCS-1cigarette/10 ml reduced PD, I(sc) by 58% and increased R by 29%.
Unlike exposure to 5% EtOH and EOCS-1, 10% EtOH combined with EOCS-1 produces a
harmful effect by dropping PD and I(sc).
CONCLUSION: Both, simultaneous, and sequential, use of these agents enhanced
their negative impact on these parameters. The enhancement of these effects are
not due to solubulization of additional tobacco products by EtOH or by or by EtOH
enhancing smoking noxious effect. Histopathologic damage needs higher
concentrations of ethanol and EOCS combination and changes were more profound
compared to the sum of the isolated effects of both agents.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD), a chronic progressive neurodegenerative
disorder, has a mainly unknown multifactorial etiology. Neuroinflammatory
mechanisms might contribute to the cascade of events leading to neuronal
degeneration. Central nervous system infections have been previously suggested as
possible etiological agents in the development of sporadic AD. Toxoplasmosis can 
be associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we aimed to
investigate the possible association between toxoplasma infection and AD.
METHODS: This study evaluated the serum anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG levels. It
included an age-matched and sex-matched study and control groups that consisted
of 34 patients with AD and 37 healthy individuals, respectively. There were no
difference between the socio economic states of the patients and control
subjects. serecm anti-I-gondi IgG levels were measured by using ELISA.
RESULTS: According to the statistical analysis, there were no significant
differences among the patients and the control participants with respect to age
(68.05±15.98, 62.91±5.89 y, P=0.072; respectively) and sex. The seropositivity
rate for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies among AD patients and control groups were 
44.1% and 24.3%, respectively, and there was significant difference between the
serum anti-T. gondii IgG levels (P=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that toxoplasma infection may be involved in
the pathogenetic mechanisms of AD. If confirmed, a positive correlation between
toxoplasmosis and AD may lead to new approaches for the management of AD.

Myoepithelial cells are an important component of salivary gland tumors and are
partly responsible from the diverse histology of them. In this study, we focus on
the myoepithelial cell differentiation by using cytological morphology in a
various types of salivary gland tumors especially with regard to their
contribution to the diagnosis. The relation of myoepithelial cells with stromal
matrix and the associated epithelial cells were evaluated. Cytologic slides of
one hundred and forty one benign and twenty malignant salivary gland tumors were 
examined for identification of morphologically different myoepithelial cells such
as; spindle-stellate, polygonal-epitheloid, plasmacytoid, basal and clear types. 
The best examples of myoepithelial cells were detected in pleomorphic adenomas,
in some monomorphic adenomas and in the adenoid cystic carcinoma cases. Most of
the pleomorphic adenomas were composed more than one type of myoepithelial cells 
and epitheloid-spindle cell combination was frequent. Basal and clear cell types 
of myoepithelial cells closely resembled the epithelial cells and their
identification was relatively difficult. Identification of myoepithelial cell
types was easier when they were associated with stromal matrix material and stood
as a secondary layer around tubule-forming epithelial cells. Myoepithelial cell
components of various salivary gland tumors may be quite different and
identification of myoepithelial cell types may pose difficulties. A confident
cytologic identification of myoepithelial cells may be critical part of
diagnosing salivary gland tumors.

University, Antalya, Turkey.

The expression of cell surface receptors, CD105 and CD166, are characteristic of 
mesenchymal stem cells in cartilage. However, there is limited data regarding
their immunolocalization in the cartilage of developing rat epiphysis. The
purpose of this study was to determine the presence of CD105 and CD 166 positive 
cells in the proximal epiphysis of developing rat humerus and specify their zonal
distribution with age. The tissues of rat humerus were taken on embryonic day 15 
(E15), embryonic day 19 (E19), postnatal day 10 (PN10), postnatal day 20 (PN20)
and adult rats and studied for the immunolocalization of CD105 and CD166. Our
results showed that CD105 and CD166 positive cells were scattered in early stages
of development of humerus epiphysis. For E15, only the hypertrophic zone was
positive, whereas for E19 almost all zones of the epiphysis were positively
stained for these markers. For PN10 and PN20, the CD105 and CD166 positive cells 
were mainly localized on the surface of the articular cartilage. In adult
articular cartilage the CD105 and CD166 positive cells were localized in the
superficial and transitional zones and in the upper regions of the deep zone. Our
study provides evidence that in the developing cartilage tissue the localization 
of CD105 and CD166 positive cells is both dynamic and stage dependent, which may 
imply the existence of stem cell-like cells in cartilage from an early age to
adult.

The objective was to assess EUS-FNA for diagnosing intramural upper GI tract
lesions. The subjects were 50 patients (21M/29F) with upper GI submucosal lesions
who underwent EUS-FNA at a referral center for GI system over a 12-month period. 
All cases were followed for 1 year after initial EUS-FNA. Cytologic diagnoses
were categorized as benign, malignant, suspicious for malignancy, mesenchymal
tumor, endocrine tumor, or nondiagnostic. All tumors were assessed for various
cytomorphologic features. The accuracy of the initial FNA diagnoses was evaluated
for each patient who also underwent subsequent histopathological examination of a
core biopsy and/or surgical biopsy/resection material of the same lesion.
According to the site of the lesions; while 84% of all esophageal lesions were
diagnosed as mesenchymal; 67% of all gastric lesions were mesenchymal. The sole
lesion was nonmesenchymal (benign cyst) in duodenum. The sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of EUS-FNA for
diagnosing submucosal mesenchymal tumors of the upper GI tract were 82.9, 73.3,
87.9, 64.7, and 80%, respectively. The corresponding values for nonmesenchymal
lesions were 100, 85.7, 80, 100, and 90.9%. Our experience confirms that EUS-FNA 
is an extremely valuable tool for diagnosing submucosal lesions of the upper GI, 
and is particularly useful in cases where endoscopic forceps biopsy does not lead
to diagnosis. Optimal results can be yielded by a close working relationship
between the gastroenterologist and pathologist.

Fumaria species (Fumariaceae) have been recorded to be used traditionally against
liver-related disorders in many countries including Turkey. Oxidative stress is
also known to be strongly associated with hepatic problems. Consequently, in the 
current study, the ethanol extracts of four Fumaria species; F. cilicica
Hausskn., F. densiflora DC., F. kralikii Jordan and F. parviflora Lam. growing in
Turkey were initially screened for their in vitro antioxidant activities by three
methods; 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging test,
Fe(+2)-ferrozine test system for metal chelating test and ferric-ion reducing
antioxidant power (FRAP) at 250, 500 and 1000 μg/ml concentrations. Then, each of
the ethanol extracts was fractionated into petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl
acetate and methanol fractions and their antioxidant activities were estimated by
DPPH radical scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibition tests at 1000 μg/ml. In
both tests, the chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions of F. cilicica were found 
to be the most active and were further investigated in in vivo hepatoprotective
activity experiment against toxicity induced by CCl(4). Total phenol and
flavonoid quantities of the ethanol extracts were determined
spectrophotometrically using Folin-Ciocalteau's and AlCl(3) reagents,
respectively. Our data revealed that the chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions
of F. cilicica did not have hepatoprotective effect and the ethanol extracts
exerted low antioxidant activity. Although protective effect of some Fumaria
species in hepatic diseases was shown in several previous studies, this record
seems to be not pertinent for F. cilicica.

Acute toxicity of the fungicide, captan, to juvenile rainbow trout was evaluated 
under static-renewal test condition. Actual concentrations of captan ranged from 
0.05 to 1.00 mg/L. The concentrations of captan that killed 50% of the rainbow
trout (3.11±0.8 g) within 24 (24 h; LC(50)), 48, 72 and 96 h were 0.57±0.09,
0.49±0.10, 0.44±0.11 and 0.38±0.13 mg/L (95% confidence limits), respectively.
None of the unexposed control fish died and the first fish died 6 h after
exposure to captan (≥0.65 mg/L). Hypertrophy, separation of epithelium from
lamellae, lamellar fusion, and epithelial cell necrosis were observed on captan
exposed fish. Gills also had scattered areas of focal lamellar hyperplasia. Fish 
exposed to fungicide had inflammation and necrosis in liver, trunk kidney and
spleen. In order, the most affected organs were gill, trunk kidney and liver.

Aberrant expression of c-met and HGF/c-met pathway provides survival advantage in
B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Eksioglu-Demiralp E(1), Akdeniz T, Bayik M.

Istanbul, Turkey. demiralp@marmara.edu.tr

BACKGROUND: B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by
accumulation of CD5(+) B lymphocytes. Decreased VLA-4 (Cd49d/CD29) and CD11a
expression and defective adhesion in B-CLL have been previously shown, although
there was no substantial data about its importance in immunobiology of B-CLL. The
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-met, plays a role in adhesion by
acting on VLA-4. c-met and VLA-4 share crucial signaling molecules in cell
survival. In this study, relationship between expressions of c-met and CD49d,
CD11a, and additional common signaling molecules in B-CLL was investigated.
METHODS: White blood cells from 24 patients with CLL were studied by flow
cytometry and/or western blotting prior to and after culturing with recombinant
HGF. HGF level from sera was measured with a bead-based flow cytometric assay.
RESULTS: c-metα and c-metβ were expressed on B-CLL cells, while no expression was
observed on normal donor CD19+ cells. This increase was inversely correlated with
decreased expression of adhesion molecules. Serum level of HGF in B-CLL was found
to be increased. In vitro experiments showed that HGF supported survival in B-CLL
cells supporting the possible function of HGF/c-met pathway in B-CLL.
Furthermore, expressions of critical signaling molecules shared by both VLA-4 and
HGF/c-met systems including Bcl-XL, Akt, PI3K, and phospho-bad(136) following HGF
stimulations of B-CLL cells have been found to be increased.
CONCLUSION: Increased expression of c-met and HGF may bypass the importance of
expression of critical adhesion molecules and support survival of B-CLL cells.
c-met, being one of the surface tyrosine kinases, may serve as a target for
future therapies in B-CLL meriting more attention.

Prostate carcinomas showing aberrant diffuse-nuclear p63 expression are extremely
rare, and there is only 1 article in the literature reporting a series of 21 such
cases. We document an additional case of p63-positive prostatic adenocarcinoma in
a 60-year-old man, whose diagnosis was difficult. The patient was found to have
an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at a general health check-up
and was referred to the hospital. His serum PSA was 4.2 ng/mL. Digital rectal
examination and transrectal ultrasonography did not reveal a lesion. Transrectal 
needle biopsy of the prostate detected atypical, small prostatic glands suspected
for adenocarcinoma at 2 cores. However immunohistochemistry showed nuclear p63
expression in the suspicious glands. Repeat biopsy revealed only high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In the third transrectal biopsy, finding of 
the same atypical glands showing perineural invasion facilitated the diagnosis of
malignancy. The patient underwent a radical prostatectomy. Five different small
tumor foci were seen in the prostate after pathological evaluation, one of which 
was p63 positive and the others p63 negative. The largest of the classic
p63-negative tumors showed a TMPRSS2-ERG translocation by fluorescent in situ
hybridization while the p63-positive tumor did not. The authors submit that this 
subtype (p63-positive prostate adenocarcinoma) should be listed among the
recognized rare variants of prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Pleural liposarcoma mimicking carcinoma in pleural effusion cytology: a case
report.

ferda58@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Primary pleural liposarcoma is extremely rare, and its most common
subtype is the myxoid subtype. To the best of our knowledge, the number of cases 
reported up to now is <20. It is primarily a disease ofindividuals 50 years of
age and it is more common in men. It has no specific symptoms except for cough
and chest pain.
CASE: A 56-year-old female presented complaining of chest pain and dyspnea for 4 
months. An increase in homogeneous density on the left hemithorax, from the apex 
to basal area, with blurring of the borders of the heart and the diaphragm, was
revealed by lung radiography. Thoracic computed tomography revealed a diffuse
pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis at the base of the left
hemithorax. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid demonstrated tumoral cells
forming papillary structures with complex branching and fine fibrovascular core. 
The tumor cells were relatively uniform and had vacuolar cytoplasm with
hyperchromatic nuclei. Upon finding CA-125 positive in the immunocytochemical
examination, the case was reported as "consistent with malignancy, possibility of
ovarian origin, cannot be excluded". As the gynecologic examination was normal,
exploratory thoracotomy was performed to take a biopsy. The case was diagnosed as
liposarcoma (myxoid type) by histopathologic examination.
CONCLUSION: Cytologic diagnosis of pleural liposarcoma is difficult due to its
rarity and resemblance to malignant mesothelioma. Cytologic properties of
liposarcoma in pleural fluid should be well known and considered in the
differential diagnosis.

We present a case of the Goldston syndrome which is the association of polycystic
kidneys with Dandy-Walker malformation. The diagnosis was made by ultrasound in
twenty second week of gestation. Obstetric ultrasound and fetal MRI studies
showed hydrocephalus, agenesis of the cerebellar hemispheres, vermian hypoplasia,
cystic dilatation of the 4(th) ventricle, enlargement of the posterior fossa,
abdominal distension, and oligohydramnios.. The kidneys were symmetrically
enlarged and multicystic. To our knowledge this is the third reported case of
Goldston syndrome which was diagnosed during intrauterine life.

Turner syndrome is associated with a higher frequency of heart defects detected
prenatally when compared to postnatal reports. The most common heart defects
detected prenatally are hypoplastic left heart syndrome and coarctation of the
aorta. We report a case involving a fetus at 16 gestational weeks with a septated
cystic hygroma located on the neck and head, an interventricular septal mass, a
hypoplastic left ventricle due to aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, and a
hypoplastic aortic arch with a karyotype of mos 45, X, [47 cells]/47, XXX [3
cells]. The autopsy findings confirmed our prenatal diagnosis with a final
diagnosis of Turner syndrome and congenital cardiac vascular malformation.

In the literature, there is no reported pediatric leiomyosarcoma case that has
metastasized from the small intestine to the adrenal gland. A 10-year-old boy who
had anemia and weight loss over 2 years presented with abdominal pain that began 
1 week previously. Radiologic examination revealed bilateral adrenal tumors. At
the time of surgery, the terminal ileum was resected and a tru-cut biopsy was
done from the right adrenal mass. The pathology report was leiomyosarcoma for
both of the resection and tru-cut specimens. We present an intestinal
leiomyosarcoma that metastasized from the small intestine to both adrenal glands 
with clinical, morphologic, and immunohistochemical studies with a literature
review.

Papillary renal cell carcinoma with lipocyte-like cells: a rare morphological
variant or an indication of aggressiveness?

Turkey.

Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common carcinoma of the 
kidney, which is classified into two types. Type 1 displays single layer of cells
with scanty pale cytoplasm and type 2 has pseudostratified high-grade nuclei with
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Recently, apart from these two types, oncocytic PRCC and 
clear-cell PRCC have been described. To the best of our knowledge, lipocyte-like 
cells have not yet been reported to accompany any subtypes of renal cell
carcinoma. Herein, we report a case of PRCC with lipocyte-like cells and
sarcomatoid features. Lipocyte-like cells might represent a special type of PRCC 
or this feature may be an indication of poor prognosis regarding its association 
with sarcomatoid change.

Comparison of FibroTest-ActiTest with histopathology in demonstrating fibrosis
and necroinflammatory activity in chronic hepatitis B and C.

Uyar C(1), Akcam FZ, Ciris M, Kaya O, Kockar C, Isler M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Infectious Diseases, Suleyman Demirel Universty Medical
Education and Research Hospital, Isparta, Turkey.

AIMS: FibroTest and ActiTest are noninvasive tests used in determining the level 
of fibrosis and the degree of necroinflammatory activity in the liver. In our
study, we aimed to investigate whether these tests could be alternative to liver 
biopsy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients were included in the study. Serum samples
were obtained and liver needle biopsy was performed on the same day. Levels of
fibrosis in FibroTest and levels of activity in ActiTest, both determined via
serum biochemical markers, were compared with levels of fibrosis and activity in 
histopathological examination. For statistical analyses, Mc Nemar chi square test
and Spearman's correlation tests were used.
RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between fibrosis in biopsy 
and the level of fibrosis in FibroTest in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)
(rho: 0.67, P < 0.0001). However, no significant correlation was determined
between the activity in biopsy and the degree of activity in ActiTest (rho: 0.29,
P < 0.05). No significant correlation was determined between both fibrosis and
activity established in biopsy and the results of FibroTest and ActiTest in the
group of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (rho: 0.22, P < 0.05 and rho:
0.15, P < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that novel and safer noninvasive biochemical
tests are needed as an alternative to histopathology in patients infected with
HBV and HCV. Consequently, we believe that liver biopsy maintains its place as a 
gold standard in determining the histopathological condition of the liver.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology and Ear, Nose, Kocatepe University, School of
Medicine, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey.

OBJECTIVES: Prostaglandins are critical mediators of inflammation and affect both
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Recent findings show that T and B
cells express COX-2 upon activation. The purpose of this study is to investigate 
the potential occurrence of COX-1 and COX-2 immunoreactivity in cases of chronic 
tonsillitis and to determine the sites of their expression. In addition, their
expression in adult patients is compared with that in child patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical techniques were used to evaluate the
expression of the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, in chronic tonsillitis tissue
specimens from adults (n = 15) and children (n = 15).
RESULTS: There was no staining in surface epithelium or reticulated crypt
epithelium. COX-1 and COX-2 expressions were observed mainly in the
intraepithelial lymphoid cells in reticulated crypt epithelium and subepithelial 
cells. Also, COX-1 and COX-2 stained cells were found in the germinal center.
There was no difference of the expressions of COX-1 and COX-2 among adults and
children. The only significant difference noted between the adults and children
was that, the adults had rich subepithelial plasma cells.
CONCLUSION: Activated B and T cells express COX-1 and COX-2 in paraffin-embedded 
tissue sections of chronic tonsillitis. Further studies need to be performed to
elucidate expression of COX enzymes and their immunologic role in tonsil
diseases. They will play an important role in the treatment of chronic
tonsillitis. Additional studies are warranted to study the effects of NSAIDs and 
selective COX-2 inhibitors in chronic tonsillitis.

Human wound age determination is of prime importance in forensic sciences.
Ubiquitin is a small protein required for ATP-dependent, nonlysosomal
intracellular protein degradation, which eliminates most of the intracellular
defective proteins. Tenascin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. The aim of 
this study was to determine the importance of ubiquitin and tenascin in wound
age. Ubiquitin and tenascin were immunohistochemically applied on formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tissues of 170 wound biopsies taken from 89 autopsy cases with 
known wound age. Pearson correlation analysis was performed for statistical
analysis. The mean age was 39.44 years. Tenascin was negative in 123 cases
(72.4%) in all series, and it was negative in 98.3% in cases with wound age under
24 hours. It was positive in 91.8% in cases with wound age over 24 hours. Mean
number of cells which expressed ubiquitin was 10.56%, while it was 4.25% in cases
with wound age under 24 hours, and it was 26.14% in cases with wound age over 24 
hours. The correlation analysis showed that both tenascin and ubiquitin were
positively correlated with wound age. But in cases with wound age over 40 days,
tenascin was found to be negative and ubiquitin was still expressed in
fibroblasts. We concluded that tenascin and ubiquitin together was useful in
determining wound age semiquantitatively.

The NOTCH signaling pathway plays important role in the development of
multicellular organisms, as it regulates cell proliferation, survival, and
differentiation. In adults, it is essential for the T- or B-lymphocyte lineage
commitment. NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations both lead the activation of the NOTCH1
pathway and are found in the majority of T-ALL patients. In this study, the
mutation analysis of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes was performed in 87 pediatric T-ALLs 
who were treated on the ALL-BFM protocols. In 19 patients (22%), activating
NOTCH1 mutations were observed either in the heterodimerization domain or in the 
PEST domain and 7 cases (10%) demonstrated FBXW7 mutations (2 cases had both
NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations). We also analyzed the relationship of the mutation
data between the clinical and biological data of the patients. NOTCH1 and FBXW7, 
NOTCH1 alone were found correlated with lower initial leucocyte counts which was 
independent from the sex and T- cell immunophenotype. However, NOTCH1 and FBXW7
mutations were not predictive of outcome in the overall cohort of pediatric
T-ALLs.

Telomeres function in human somatic tissues to stabilize chromosome ends.
Telomere shortening can be one of the ways that cause chromosomal instability in 
the pathogenesis of prostatic carcinoma. In the current study, we evaluated
telomere length (TL) in normal and malignant prostate tissues, and its
association with prognostic factors and with time to biochemical tumor
recurrence. Tissue microarrays constructed from paraffin blocks from radical
prostatectomy specimens containing 61 randomly selected cases were used. Sections
were hybridized with a Cy3-labeled telomere-specific peptide nucleic acid probe. 
TL, proportional to probe fluorescence intensity, was visually evaluated.
Statistical analysis was done to relate TL clinical and pathological prognostic
variables. The majority (49/61) of prostate cancers displayed abnormally short
telomeres. Univariate analysis revealed inverse correlation between telomere
shortening in tumor and Gleason scores (p=0.017). Multivariate analyses pointed
to TL as an independent predictor in addition to serum pre-operative PSA for
reduced biochemical progression-free survival (p=0.035). Telomere shortening is a
common alteration in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Normal or long telomeres are
rarely seen and, when present, seem to provide a growth advantage for the tumor
as being an advocate for poor differentiation.

Protective effects of melatonin on testicular torsion/detorsion-induced
ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.

Trakya, Edirne 22030, Turkey. mkanter65@yahoo.com

Testicular torsion causes an enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species, which
contributes to the pathophysiology of tissue damage. The aim of this study was to
investigate the protective effect of melatonin on testicular
torsion/detorsion-induced ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. A total of 24 male
Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups of 8 animals each: control,
I/R, and I/R treated with melatonin. The ischemia period was 5 h and orchiectomy 
was performed after 5 h of detorsion. Melatonin (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally
[i.p.]) was administrated only once, 40 min prior to detorsion. Spermatogenesis
and mean seminiferous tubule diameter (MSTD) were significantly decreased in the 
I/R groups were compared to the control group. Furthermore, the melatonin treated
animals showed an improved histological appearance in the I/R group. Our data
indicate a significant reduction in the activity of TUNEL; there was a rise in
the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and testosterone in
testes tissue of the I/R group treated with melatonin therapy. Electron
microscopy of the testes of the rats demonstrated that pretreatment with
melatonin was particularly effective in preventing mitochondrial degeneration,
dilatation of SER, and enlarged intercellular spaces in both Sertoli and
spermatid cells in the I/R treated animals. We believe that further preclinical
research into the utility of melatonin may indicate its usefulness as a potential
treatment on testes injury after I/R in rats.

Primary cardiac undifferentiated sarcoma: role of intraoperative imprint cytology
and frozen section of two cases.

Primary cardiac tumors are very rare, and a vast majority of such malignant
tumors are sarcomas. Associated symptoms are usually vague and nonspecific
resulting in a late diagnosis and poorer prognosis. Most cardiac sarcomas have
been reported in autopsy series. Although echocardiography may help make a
diagnosis of a cardiac sarcoma, histopathological confirmation is quintessential.
Presented here are two cases of patients who underwent successful surgery for the
removal of a cardiac tumor, along with echocardiographic, cytological, and
histopathological findings as well as a compact literature review. In both
patients, the masses were on the surface of the mitral valve, and intraoperative 
evaluation of frozen sections and imprint cytology were indicative of a "probably
malignant" mesenchymal tumor prompting more extensive surgical resection.
Immunohistochemical staining of the resected material in both cases was only
positive for vimentin, leading to a diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma. One of
the patients died 3 months after surgery, while the other who received adjuvant
chemotherapy was still alive after 4 months. Surgery remains the most definite
treatment for cardiac sarcomas. The use of intraoperative frozen section and
imprint cytology plays an important role in the decision to extend surgical
resection.

Heavy metals can accumulate in the environment and cause serious damages to
ecosystems and human health. Boron is considered to be essential micronutrient
with its well established biological functions and the antioxidant effects of
boric acid (BA) are controversial. However, the potential of important boron
compounds in cellular activities remains unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to
assess the efficacies of some boron compounds (BA, borax, colemanite and ulexite)
on the genotoxicity induced by heavy metals (arsenic trioxide, colloidal bismuth 
subcitrate, cadmium chloride, mercury chloride and lead chloride) in human blood 
cultures. For this aim, sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei (MN)
assays were performed to establish DNA damages in lymphocytes. Besides, oxidative
stress was monitored by estimating the changes of main antioxidant enzyme
activities and the levels of total glutathione (TGSH) in erythrocytes. The
present study showed that heavy metal treatments increased the frequencies of SCE
and MN and the plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) level; decreased the antioxidant
enzyme activities and the level of TGSH compared to controls. Whereas, the tested
boron compounds (5-20 ppm) significantly reduced the genotoxic effects induced by
low doses of heavy metals. Our results revealed that the protective roles of
boron compounds occurred with the effectiveness on their anti-oxidant capacity.
In conclusion, these compounds could be useful in the development of functional
food and raw materials of medicine.

The 1st pediatric case of sertoliform cystadenoma with unique features is
described herein. The patient is a 6-year-old boy who presented with gynecomastia
and a left testicular cystic mass. Histopathologically the tumor was found to
originate from the rete channels, filling and distending them with areas of mural
Sertoli cell proliferations reminiscent of large cell Sertoli cell tumor
(noncalcifying form) and showing widespread intratubular Sertoli cell
proliferation islands in the vicinity. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical
features are described in light of the relevant literature.

Berna]; Balc, Yasemin [corrected to Balci, Yasemin].

The postmortem interval is estimated based on physical, biochemical, and
morphologic changes in dead bodies, scene investigation findings, and judicial
investigation findings. Many factors affect the onset and the course of the
postmortem changes. There is no established method for accurate estimation of the
postmortem interval, especially with regard to putrefied dead bodies. Aiming to
determine the consistency and the variation of postmortem interval estimations in
cases with various putrefaction degrees by forensic medicine assistants and
specialists from different centers, a prospective study was undertaken. A form
containing data about the time, environment, and geographical location where the 
cases were found, along with their postmortem changes was mailed to 110 forensic 
medicine assistants and specialists from different centers, who were also asked
to note their postmortem interval estimations. About half of the forms were
returned. Those postmortem interval estimations made based on the information
included in the forms, showed great variability between the participants, and in 
only 6 cases a consistency exceeding 50% was found between the participants and
the autopsy teams. It is not possible to estimate the postmortem interval in a
standard way by using only the postmortem changes of putrefied bodies. Therefore,
especially in the cases involving putrefied bodies, in addition to the postmortem
changes, factors such as environmental conditions, the scene, and judicial
investigation findings should be taken into consideration.

A valuable adjunct to FNA diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma: in-house PCR 
assay for BRAF T1799A (V600E).

The diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules generally starts with FNA cytology.
However, approximately one-fifth of cytologic evaluations yield indeterminate
cytological findings but only 20% of cases with indeterminate thyroid nodule
cytology have a cancer diagnosis, emphasizing the need for an effective ancillary
test based on FNA material to help prevent unnecessary surgery. Detection of
BRAFV600E mutation, the genetic signature of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in
FNA material provides an invaluable diagnostic adjunct to overcome the
limitations of FNA cytology. There are many ways to detect V600E, such as direct 
DNA sequencing, allele-specific PCR and hybridization-based colorimetric methods.
In this study, a newer simple PCR method is presented that removes requirements
for sequencing special equipment and commercial kits. Two forward primers
including the mutant sequence specific (F2), and one common reverse (R) primer
were optimized to generate a 241 bp fragment (F1R), an internal PCR control, and 
a 141 bp fragment (F2R) denoting the presence of V600E. Sensitivity studies
revealed that the assay is capable of detecting V600E even in 1 ng of DNA. Direct
sequencing data of 241 bp F1R fragment proved the specificity of the assay. For
validation studies of the sequence specific multiplex PCR assay, archival FNA
slides were used in a group of thyroid lesions including PTC, follicular
carcinoma, follicular adenoma, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and benign thyroid nodules.
The newer PCR-based method presented in this study is a practical, inexpensive
one-step assay to detect the BRAF T1796A mutation on FNA samples.

Particular functions of estrogen and progesterone in establishment of uterine
receptivity and embryo implantation.

Ozturk S(1), Demir R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Akdeniz
University, Antalya, Turkey.

The process of embryo implantation requires synchronized development of
blastocyst and timely establishment of uterine receptivity. Establishment of
uterine receptivity, preimplantation embryo development and embryo implantation
events are mainly regulated by certain factors, including cytokines, chemokines, 
growth factors and steroid hormones. Recent studies suggest that steroid
hormones, especially estrogen and progesterone, play important roles in
supporting endometrial preparations to establish endometrial receptivity. Timely 
establishment of endometrial receptivity is a crucial process for providing
successful embryo implantation. Although many investigations until now have been 
performed to precisely understand the effects of estrogen and progesterone on
acquiring uterine receptivity and embryo implantation in humans and rodents,
there are limited numbers of studies that largely focus on this subject.
Therefore, in this article we discuss the studies associated with significant
functions of estrogen and progesterone in establishing receptive endometrium and 
the process of embryo implantation in humans and rodents.

The present study was designed to evaluate whether the administration of
s-methylisothiourea and melatonin has protective potential in intestinal
ischemia/reperfusion injury. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into
five groups. Ileal specimens were obtained to determine the levels of
malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content, levels of antioxidant enzymes and
evaluation of histologic changes. Combination of s-methylisothiourea and
melatonin, led to a statistically significant increase in activities of
antioxidant enzymes with a decrease in malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl
content and intestinal mucosal injury scores. It was shown; combination of SMT
and melatonin may exert more promised results.

Recently the authors have reported the potent beneficial effect of caffeic acid
phenethyl ester (CAPE) on cholestatic oxidative liver injury induced by acute
bile ligation in Swiss albino rats. Herein, they report the ultrastructural
hepatocellular alterations induced by acute bile duct ligation and the effect of 
CAPE administration on these alterations. Bile duct ligation resulted in many
degenerative changes, such as vacuolization, mitochondrial degeneration,
endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, and lysosome accumulation within the cytoplasm 
of hepatocytes. Mitochondrial degeneration was also observed within the cytoplasm
of the cells of biliary ductular epithelium. CAPE potentially protected the
hepatocytes from the cholestasis-induced cellular injury.

BACKGROUND: The use of ultrastructural analysis in the diagnostic work-up of
histologic specimens has been well studied but less is known about the utility of
electron microscopy (EM) in cytopathology.
DESIGN: 149,006 non-gynecologic cytology cases at the Massachusetts General
Hospital between the years 1993 and 2006 were searched to identify those in which
material had been submitted for EM. Cytologic and EM diagnoses were correlated
with available histologic diagnoses. The results were put into one of three
categories: confirmatory, diagnostic, or insufficient material for diagnosis
(IMFD).
RESULTS: Material for EM was obtained from 178 cytology cases that included 131
fine-needle aspirates (FNA) and 47 exfoliative specimens. EM provided additional 
diagnostic information beyond that offered by cytologic examination alone in 32% 
of cases, and in 48% of cases EM confirmed the cytologic findings. Insufficient
material and discrepant results were noted for EM evaluation in 19% of cases and 
in 1% cases respectively. EM was most useful when applied to FNAs for
subclassifying tumors as epithelial or mesenchymal (45.6%), for the diagnosis of 
non-neoplastic processes (15.7%) such as alveolar proteinosis and amyloidosis,
and for the identification of microorganisms (12.2%). In our study, although EM
was infrequently applied to exfoliative specimens to distinguish mesothelioma
from adenocarcinoma, it proved to be very useful in this setting.
CONCLUSION: When adequate material is obtained, EM can contribute significantly
to the evaluation of both FNA and exfoliative cytology cases, including the
diagnosis and subclassification of epithelial and mesenchymal tumors,
non-neoplastic processes, and the identification of microorganisms.

The evaluation of the surgical margins is a major concern in surgical pathology, 
and marking of surgical margins with substances such as alcian blue, Tipp-ex,
artist's pigments, colored gelatin, starch, erythrocyte layers, etc. was
recommended for this purpose; Indian ink and tissue marking dyes are widely used.
As there is no systematic study comparing tissue marking dyes and Indian ink as
the most common substances used for the purpose, this study was conducted to
compare the two. Penetration into the tissue, brightness under the microscope,
the spreading area of one drop of dye on tissue paper, the intensity of colors,
and unit price were compared for each of the five colors of Rotring's Indian ink 
and Thermo-Shandon's tissue marking dyes, applied on reduction mammoplasty
specimens. Rotring's Indian ink is proved to be just as effective as
Thermo-Shandon's tissue marking dye and bares the majority of the characteristics
of a perfect staining substance, which are easily applied, quickly fixed, durable
and cheap, contain no potential contaminants, be work safe, would not
smudge/stain surrounding tissues, and look bright under the microscope without
obscuring the view.

Turkey.

Gonodoblastomas with ovarian germ cell tumors other than dysgerminoma coexists
very rarely with yolk sac tumor (YST). Because of this rarity, we report a case
of gonadoblastoma with YST. An 18-year-old female patient was admitted to our
hospital with an abdomino-pelvic mass. Ultrasonographical examinations revealed a
15X14 cm heterogenous pelvic mass with calcific foci in the left adnexal area.
Macroscopically, the resected mass was oval and measured 18X15X15 cm and weighed 
3150 gm. Histological examination showed both gonadoblastic and YST areas. There 
were many gonadoblastic nests in the subcapsular areas of the tumor. The
gonadoblastic nests were composed of large and small cells. The YST areas showed 
enteric differentiation and numerous hyaline globules. Immunohistochemical
examination may help in the diagnosis of these gonadoblastoma with YST.

The tetraspanin transmembrane protein CD9 plays an important role in inhibiting
cell motility in numerous neoplastic cell lines, including lung, gastric,
pancreatic, and bladder carcinomas. The prognostic importance of CD9 in the
survival of gastric carcinoma patients has not been examined to date, and in the 
present study, we attempted to define its prognostic value. The study included 49
(35 men and 14 women) patients with locally advanced (stages II-IV) gastric
cancer. The median age was 55 years (range, 22-73 years). Surgery was the initial
treatment for all patients, followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Tissue
sections were evaluated immunohistochemically with a monoclonal anti-CD9
antibody. Of the 49 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, 11 (22.4%) were
CD9-positive, and 38 (77.6%) were CD9-negative. A significant prognostic value in
disease-free survival and overall survival was observed in T classification and
CD9 positivity. In conclusion, CD9 expression in gastric cancer appears to be
associated with poor prognosis.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted in chromosome ten (PTEN), angiogenesis and clinicopathological parameters
of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.METHODS: We examined immunohistochemical
expression of VEGF and PTEN and CD34 for microvessel density (MVD) in sections of
formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks of 140 patients with squamous
cell carcinoma of the larynx. The intensity of VEGF and PTEN staining and the
proportion of cells staining were scored.
RESULTS: The tumor grade was not significantly related to PTEN expression, but it
was to VEGF expression (p = 0.400; p = 0.015, respectively). While there was no
significant relationship between PTEN expression and tumor size and cartilage
invasion (p = 0.311, p = 0.128), there was a significant relationship between the
severity of VEGF expression and tumor size (p = 0.006) and lymph node metastasis 
(p = 0.048) but not cartilage invasion (p = 0.129). MVD was significantly higher 
in high-grade tumors (p = 0.003) but had no significant relationship between MVD,
lymph node metastasis, and cartilage invasion (p = 0.815, p = 0.204). There was
also no significant relationship between PTEN and VEGF expression (p = 0.161) and
between PTEN and VEGF expression and the MVD (p = 0.120 and p = 0.175,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased VEGF expression may play an important role in the outcome 
of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. PTEN expression was not related to VEGF
expression and clinicopathological features of squamous cell carcinoma of the
larynx.

Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease): controversies in diagnosis and
classification.

CONTEXT: Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a chronic
inflammatory disorder of the small intestine characterized by malabsorption after
ingestion of gluten in individuals with a certain genetic background. Clinical
presentation can vary from full-blown malabsorption to subtle and atypical
symptoms. Diagnosis currently relies on clinicopathologic studies including
mucosal biopsy, serologic tests, and the effects of a diet free of gluten on the 
symptoms. Mucosal pathologic features are also variable, ranging from mild
abnormalities, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis, to completely flat
mucosa. Since patients with minimal histologic lesion of intraepithelial
lymphocytosis often present with normal serologic findings, biopsy diagnosis
becomes more important for identifying such individuals. Classification of
mucosal pathology in gluten-sensitive enteropathy has been a subject of
controversy among pathologists and needs to be revised according to the current
understanding of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: To highlight the variations in clinical and pathologic presentation
of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, to emphasize the importance of small-intestinal 
biopsy evaluation in the diagnosis, and to propose a new classification of
mucosal pathology in gluten-sensitive enteropathy, in an effort to overcome the
problems related to the classification systems currently available.
DATA SOURCES: A review of the literature on clinicopathologic features and the
morphologic spectrum of gluten-sensitive enteropathy is presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that there are many entities in the differential
diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, because of the varied
clinicopathologic spectrum of the disease, diagnosis depends on good
clinicopathologic communication. The classification that is presented in this
review is a simple and practical approach to improve clinicopathologic
correlation in gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

Novel monoclonal antibodies detect Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) in the
cytoplasm of human cells from multiple tumor tissue arrays.

Turkey.

Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1, also known as ZEB2) represses the transcription
of E-cadherin and mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in development and
tumor metastasis. Due to the lack of human SIP1-specific antibodies, its
expression in human tumor tissues has not been studied in detail by
immunohistochemistry. Hence, we generated two anti-SIP1 monoclonal antibodies,
clones 1C6 and 6E5, with IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, respectively. The specificity
of these antibodies was shown by Western blotting studies using siRNA mediated
downregulation of SIP1 and ZEB1 in a human osteosarcoma cell line. In the same
context, we also compared them with 5 commercially available SIP1 antibodies.
Antibody specificity was further verified in an inducible cell line system by
immunofluorescence. By using both antibodies, we evaluated the tissue expression 
of SIP1 in paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays consisting of 22 normal and 101
tumoral tissues of kidney, colon, stomach, lung, esophagus, uterus, rectum,
breast and liver. Interestingly, SIP1 predominantly displayed a cytoplasmic
expression, while the nuclear localization of SIP1 was observed in only 6 cases. 
Strong expression of SIP1 was found in distal tubules of kidney, glandular
epithelial cells of stomach and hepatocytes, implicating a co-expression of SIP1 
and E-cadherin. Squamous epithelium of the esophagus and surface epithelium of
colon and rectum were stained with moderate to weak intensity. Normal uterus,
breast and lung tissues remained completely negative. By comparison with their
normal tissues, we observed SIP1 overexpression in cancers of the kidney, breast,
lung and uterus. However, SIP1 expression was found to be downregulated in tumors
from colon, rectum, esophagus, liver and stomach tissues. Finally we did
nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation in 3 carcinoma cell lines and detected SIP1 in 
both fractions, nucleus being the dominant one. To our best knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive immunohistochemical study of the expression of SIP1 in a 
series of human cancers. Our finding that SIP1 is not exclusively localized to
nucleus suggests that the subcellular localization of SIP1 is regulated in normal
and tumor tissues. These novel monoclonal antibodies may help elucidate the role 
of SIP1 in tumor development.

Distinguishing between injuries resulted from electrical current versus thermal
energy is not only a difficult, but also a controversial issue in forensic
medicine practice.In this study, an electrical current and a cautery were applied
to dorsal skins of 10 rats and biopsies were taken from the injured sites as well
as normal skin. In the histologic sections; some planimetric variables such as
the perimeter, area, diameter equivalent circle, minimum feret, maximum feret,
and the circular form factor of the nuclei located in normal and injured
epidermis were measured with the aid of the computer-assisted image analysis.When
compared with normal skin, all of the variables -nuclear area, perimeter,
diameter equivalent circle, minimum feret, maximum feret, and circular form
factor seemed to be decreased both in the electrical current- and cautery-applied
skin samples.The differences between the variables measured in normal skin and in
electrical- or cautery-applied skin samples were statistically significant (P <
0.05). However none of the variables showed any meaningful differences between
the electrical- and cautery-applied areas.It was concluded that the nuclear
changes due to electrical current and thermal injury are identical and
morphometric analysis seems not to make any further contributions in the
differentiating from each other. Therefore, conventional and more established
methods for detection of metallization would be more effective.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a difference between
Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and pure vascular dementia (VaD) in relation to
nitrosative stress levels. We determined serum nitric oxide (NO), oxidized
low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL), and 3-nitrotyrosine levels (3-NT) in healthy
elderly individuals (controls, n=15, mean age=73.4+/-7.9 y), AD patients (n=30;
mean age=71.2+/-12.7 y) and VaD patients (n=20; mean age=75.2+/-7.5 y). Patients 
were under anticholinesterase drug therapy. Our results showed that serum NO and 
ox-LDL levels in AD patients group were significantly higher than in both
controls (P<0.001 and P<0.001) and VaD patients (P<0.01 and P<0.001). However, no
significant differences in plasma NO and ox-LDL levels were found between VaD and
controls. Our study did not reveal significant differences in plasma 3-NT values 
of dementia patients when compared with controls. There was a significant
negative correlation between Mini-Mental State Examination score and serum NO
levels in dementia patients (r=-0.349, P<0.01). Serum NO levels were also
positively correlated with serum ox-LDL levels (r=0.358, P<0.01). In conclusion, 
elevation in serum levels of NO was present in probable AD patients but not in
VaD patients, and this seems to be related to both ox-LDL levels and cognitive
status.

Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey. gersoy@istanbul.edu.tr

Because of the specific structure of forensic medicine in Turkey, reexamination
of histopathologic specimens is a frequent practice. The aim of the present study
is the assessment of microscopic diagnostic consistency in forensic pathology
between different laboratories. Reports of the Council of Forensic Medicine
between 2001 and 2004 were examined, and 150 cases with second pathologic
examination were found. Results of histopathologic reports from peripheral
laboratories were compared with those made by the Council pathologists with
regard to diagnostic consistency. Consistency was assessed in 3 groups and 1
subgroup. Group 1, consistent and minor inconsistency; includes a major
consistency subgroup. Group 2, major inconsistency, is the second diagnosis which
is lethal; group 3, major inconsistency, is the first diagnosis which is lethal. 
The lung was found to be the organ with the highest frequency of diagnostic major
inconsistency (group 2 and 3) and major consistency. Bronchopneumonia was the
most common diagnosis. The brain had the highest frequency of intercenter
diagnostic overall consistency (90.2%, group 1). Myocardial infarction was the
diagnosis most frequently rejected on reevaluation (group 3). In conclusion,
forensic pathology requires different experience than surgical ones. In cases of 
discrepancy between the anamnesis of the lethal event and pathologic findings,
reevaluation of specimen is mandatory to avoid any diagnostic errors. Quality
assurance systems with all include internal and external control mechanisms will 
improve the diagnostic reliability.

Ischemia, hypoxia, and elevated vascular resistance disturb placental functions
by increasing oxidative stress. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is an oxidative
stress marker. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a nitric oxide enzyme 
with a key role in pathologic and physiologic angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.
This study was performed to investigate the role of oxidative stress in the
pathogenesis of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR)
pregnancies by comparing the levels of HSP70 and eNOS in placentas from women
with these diseases and those with healthy pregnancies. HSP70 and eNOS were
examined using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 135 placental villous tissues
obtained from normal pregnancies (n=45) and pregnancies complicated with
preeclampsia (n=45) and IUGR (n=45). The intensity of labeling in placental
tissues with antibodies to HSP70 and eNOS was scored between 0 and 3, using a
semiquantitative scale. HSP70 and eNOS levels were increased in the
syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, and extravillous trophoblast cells of
preeclamptic and IUGR placentas (P<0.001), compared with normal pregnancies.
However, their levels were increased only in the villous endothelial cells of
IUGR placentas (P<0.001). Oxidative stress is thought to play an important role
in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and IUGR pregnancies.

The rate of diagnostic error has not declined over the last 30 years despite the 
improvement in diagnosis methods. Today, the probability to encounter a major
diagnostic change in autopsy is still high. The special autopsy that provides
clinicians the necessary feedback is performed seldom in our country. This study 
has been started upon the claim that the malpractice cases in scope of forensic
cases could be a very useful database. About 525 cases with faulty medical
application that resulted in death have been encountered according to the cases
that have been sent to the Forensic Medical Institution, which has been the
consultative authority of the Ministry of Justice between the years 2001 and
2005. Among these, 375 cases on which autopsies have been conducted are included 
in the scope of the study. The cases with and without major diagnostic changes
have been compared in aspects of gender, age groups, and period spent in health
units. When the concordance between autopsy and clinical diagnosis for the 375
cases that were included in the study is examined, it can be seen that clinical
diagnosis is verified with autopsy in 49.1% of the cases whereas neither autopsy 
nor clinical diagnosis was encountered in 14.7% of them. The diseases where
diagnostic faults are mostly encountered are ruptured aortic aneurysm, myocardial
infarction and pneumonia. The majority of the cases without a clinical diagnosis 
comprises of complications that occur after operations. In the study,
considerable major diagnostic changes were realized after autopsy, which shows
that autopsy has an important place in Turkey in spite of the improved methods of
diagnosis. Also, in the cases with major diagnostic changes, the medical
malpractice rate was high. This shows that autopsy is influential in revealing
medical malpractice failures. In the study, we found out that the number of
autopsies was high in the cases with a malpractice claim. We aim to increase this
number. We are sure that such increment would increase decision accuracy.

The present study describes the pathologic changes and cellular apoptosis in the 
central nervous system (CNS) of fetal and neonatal small ruminants infected with 
border disease virus (BDV), as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization. Abortions of ewes and goats were observed, as were births of lambs
and kids with poor survival rates and nervous signs. Lesions included cerebellar 
hypoplasia, porencephaly, hydranencephaly, and nonsuppurative
meningoencephalomyelitis with hypomyelinogenesis. Viral antigens and RNA were
present in neuropil, glial, and neuronal cells, especially in periventricular
areas, cerebellum, and brainstem. TUNEL positivity and labeling of anti-bax and
anti-caspases 3, 8, and 9 were detected in BDV-infected CNSs, especially in glial
and neuronal cells. The double immunostaining and TUNEL assay revealed that in
BDV-infected animals, not only were BDV-infected glial and neuronal cells
undergoing apoptosis, but so were uninfected cells in close vicinity of
BDV-infected cells. The expression of activated caspases 3, 8, 9; bax; and TUNEL 
in glial and neuronal cells of the infected fetal and neonatal kids were
significantly (P < .05) higher than those of the infected fetal and neonatal
lambs. Yet, the expression of bcl-2 in the CNSs of the infected fetal and
neonatal lambs was higher (P < .05) in neuronal and glial cells than in those of 
the infected fetal and neonatal kids. The results suggest that cell death in the 
BDV-infected CNS is induced by intrinsic and extrinsic cascades of apoptotic
pathways.

Comment in
    Fetal Pediatr Pathol. 2012 Jun;31(3):190.

Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in neonatal period is characterized by
insulin hypersecretion. The major feature is severe hypoglycemia, generally
unresponsive to routine medical treatment. Subtotal or total pancreatectomy is
performed in unresponsive cases. In this case report, we present a newborn with
persistent hypoglycemia unresponsive to medical treatment with dysrhythmic left
ventricular hypertrophy. The insulin/C-peptide ratio was 58 as a confirmation of 
diagnosis. Since hypoglycemia persisted after the initial medical treatment, a
subtotal pancreatectomy was performed followed by near-total pancreatectomy. A
histologic examination revealed diffuse insulin islets. At the 70th post-natal
day, death occurred due to heart failure and ventricular dysrhythmia. To our
knowledge, severe dysrhythmia and left ventricular hypertrophy in persistent
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PPH) is identified in the patient.

Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. vural73@yahoo.com

Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is generally used as a marker in diagnosis and follow-up 
of germ cell tumors and hepatoblastomas. However, serum AFP levels were elevated 
in our three patients with Wilms tumor. The elevated levels could only be
decreased completely by surgery and not by chemotherapy. Histopathologically, the
tumors consisted of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial cells. Chemotherapy was
only effective on stromal and epithelial components of the tumors. In AFP
staining, the source of AFP production was identified as blastemal tumor cells.
Because the increased AFP levels were decreased after surgery, AFP levels may be 
used in the follow-up of the patients with Wilms tumor. Herein, we report three
patients with Wilms tumor whose serum AFP levels were elevated and who had
diffuse WT-1 and focal AFP expression in all tumors, immunohistochemically.

Antenatal Bartter syndrome: analysis of two cases with placental findings.

Dane B(1), Dane C, Aksoy F, Cetin A, Yayla M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics, Haseki Training & Research Hospital,
Istanbul, Turkey.

The prenatal diagnosis of Bartter syndrome can be based on the high chloride
level in the amniotic fluid. Microscopic examination of the placenta in untreated
cases showed extensive mineralization in the chorionic villi in previous studies.
Two cases were presented at 26-29 weeks of gestation with severe polyhydramnios. 
The mothers were treated with Indomethacin, KCl, and serial amniocentesis in
order to reduce the amniotic fluid volume and prevent fetal hypokalemia. The
microscopic examination of the placenta revealed focal calcification and acute
atherosis in placental vessels. The treatment with Indomethacin in the antenatal 
period can prevent severe nephrocalcinosis.

In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the role of oxidative stress on
the hepatic damage caused by methotrexate (MTX) and the possible protective
effects of beta-carotene against this damage. The rats were divided into four
groups as control, MTX (20 mg/kg ip), beta-carotene (10 mg/kg/day ip) + MTX, and 
beta-carotene. Histopathologic alterations were evaluated for defining the liver 
damage. The tissue, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and
glutathione peroxidase (GP-x) contents and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
and alanine aminotranferase (ALT) activities were also examined. Histopathologic 
damage for each group score findings have been determined as control: 0.66 +/-
0.33; MTX: 7.0 +/- 0.68; beta-carotene + MTX: 3.3 +/- 0.42; and beta-carotene:
0.5 +/- 0.3. In the MTX-treated group, MDA, AST, and ALT values were increased,
while SOD and GP-x values were decreased compared with the control group. In the 
beta-carotene + MTX-treated group, AST and ALT values significantly decreased,
while all other parameters were similar to the control group. This study shows
that beta-carotene has a protective effect on MTX-induced oxidative hepatic
damage. Consequently, it seems that an antioxidant agents like beta-carotene may 
be useful in decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy.

Giant chordoid meningioma symptomatic immediately after pregnancy: report of a
rare case.

Bakar B(1), Sav A, Tekkok IH.

Author information: 
(1)Kirikkale University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery,
Kirikkale, Turkey. bulentbanrs@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Chordoid meningioma is a very rare subtype of meningioma with less
than 90 cases reported in the literature. Meningiomas related with a pregnancy
are also very rare. Herein, we present a pregnancy-associated case of a chordoid 
meningioma and briefly discuss possible mechanisms.
CASE HISTORY: Approximately 10 hours after a Caesarean section, a 37-year-old
woman became stuporous with a Glasgow coma scale score of 9 - 10 and the right
pupil became dilated without reaction to light. An emergency computed tomography 
scan showed a right frontotemporal lesion measuring 8 x 7 x 6 cm which enhanced
moderately and homogenously after intravenous contrast injection. The patient's
hemoglobin level was slightly lower than normal level but there was no
dysgammaglobulinemia or lymphoid hyperplasia. The patient was immediately taken
to the operating theater and the tumor was gross totally removed. The
postoperative period was uneventful; and histopathological diagnosis was chordoid
meningioma.
CONCLUSION: The exact mechanism causing a pregnancy-associated increase in the
size of meningiomas and the amount of peritumoral edema has not been clearly
elucidated. As for this case of chordoid meningioma associated with pregnancy, we
think mucin accumulation in tumor could be involved in an increase in the tumor
size while delivery procedures with the common anaesthetic and sedative drugs may
also have enhanced the peritumoral edema by causing a relative decrease in the
cerebral blood flow.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Dr. Lutfi Kirdar Kartal Training and Research
Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. dilekyavuzer@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory pseudotumor is an uncommon lesion of unknown etiology
most frequently involving the lungs and orbits. Primary intracranial inflammatory
pseudotumors are exceptionally rare. Herein, we report a case of inflammatory
pseudotumor that arises from the central nervous system in a 25-year-old man.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The patient presented with numbness in his right arm and
right leg. Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging demonstrated a left
fronto-parietal lobulated mass with intense contrast enhancement and perilesional
edema mimicking a high grade glioma or metastasis. The lesion was removed by
complete surgical resection.
RESULTS: Pathologic examination showed spindle cell proliferation in a
collagenous background with dense infiltrates of mononuclear inflammatory
cells.The spindle cells were diffusely immunopositive for vimentin and focally
positive smooth muscle actin but the cells did not show glial fibrillary acidic
protein, epithelial membrane antigen, synaptophysin, S-100 protein, anaplastic
lymphoma kinase-1 protein and CD1a immunoreactivity. Based on the morphologic and
immunohistochemical findings, the diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor was made.
After surgery, the symptoms had disappeared. No recurrence was observed at the
eleven-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Although rare, inflammatory pseudotumor of central nervous system is 
important in the differential diagnosis of the tumor-like intracranial lesions.
We discuss the etiopathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic issues related to
this entity, and review the literature.

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is a rare, distinctive soft tissue neoplasm, typically
occurring in the distal extremities of young adult patients. Although CCS shows
melanocytic differentiation, it is now clear that it is clinicopathologically and
genetically distinct from conventional malignant melanoma. The 'osteoclast-rich
tumour of the gastrointestinal tract with features resembling clear cell sarcoma 
of soft parts' is an extraordinarily rare gastrointestinal neoplasm that shares
some features of CCS, but differs from it in other ways. The historical,
histopathological, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical and genetic aspects of
these two tumours are reviewed in this article.

BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic-fibroblast growth
factor (b-FGF), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are factors that
take part in placental angiogenesis. They are highly expressed during embryonic
and fetal development, especially in the first trimester. In this study, we aimed
to investigate the role of placental angiogenesis in the development of
intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) by comparing the levels of expression of
VEGF-A, b-FGF, and eNOS in normal-term pregnancy and IUGR placentas.
METHODS: The expression of VEGF-A, b-FGF, and eNOS was studied using the
avidin-biotin-peroxidase method in placental tissues diagnosed as normal (n = 55)
and IUGR (n = 55). Results were evaluated in a semi-quantitative manner.
RESULTS: The expression of all the markers was significantly higher (p < 0.001)
in cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, extravillous trophoblasts, vascular
smooth muscle cells, chorionic villous stromal cells, and villous vascular
endothelial cells of the IUGR placentas when compared with those collected from
normal-term pregnancies.
CONCLUSION: Increased expression of VEGF-A, b-FGF, and eNOS may be the result of 
inadequate uteroplacental perfusion, supporting the proposal that abnormal
angiogenesis plays a role in the pathophysiology of IUGR.

It can be difficult to differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from
metastatic adenocarcinoma (MA). An appropriate immunohistochemical panel is
required for the differential diagnosis. This study aimed at finding the best
panel, including hepatocyte-specific antigen (Hepatocyte), pCEA, CD10, Villin,
CD34, TTF-1, MOC-31, CK7, and CK20 antibodies. Sixty-eight cases of HCC and 107
cases of MA were investigated. Hepatocyte positivity was seen in 95.6% of HCCs
and in 1.9% of MAs. pCEA was expressed in 47.8% of HCCs and in 86.8% of MAs. CD10
stained 73.13% of HCCs and 36.9% of MAs. Villin was positive in 23.5% of HCCs and
in 81.0% of MAs. Canalicular staining with pCEA, CD10, and Villin was seen only
in HCCs. Sinusoidal CD34 staining was seen only in 42.6% of HCCs. A small subset 
of HCCs demonstrated cytoplasmic TTF-1 and MOC-31. CK7 was expressed in 29.4% of 
HCCs and in 29.9% of MAs, whereas CK20 stained 14.7% of HCCs and 62.6% of MAs. In
conclusion, Hepatocyte should be combined with pCEA, MOC-31, CD10, and CD34.
Canalicular staining with pCEA, CD10, and Villin is specific for HCC. CK7 and
CK20 expression may be seen in some HCCs. We suggest that the best panel for
discriminating HCC from MA should contain Hepatocyte, MOC-31, pCEA, CD10, and
CD34.

Immunohistochemical FHIT expression still exists in early lesions of basal cell
carcinoma.

In this study, we evaluated the expression of Fragile Histidine Triad (FHIT) in
basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The FHIT locus was found to be altered in numerous
types of cancer [6,7,18,20,22,25,26]. However, we found only one study dealing
with FHIT expression in BCC [11]. In our study, we used immunohistochemical
methods for the evaluation of FHIT expression in tissue samples of 42 BCC cases. 
The control group was formed by intradermal melanocytic nevi (IMN). Ki-67
labeling index was used to compare cellular proliferation of BCC with internal
and external controls. The study group was further separated into two subgroups, 
according to the intensity of FHIT staining. The Ki-67 indexes of these subgroups
were also compared with each other. As a primary result, there was no significant
decrease in FHIT expression in early lesions of BCC. As a second finding, there
was no correlation between the intensity of FHIT staining and Ki-67 labeling
index. As a third finding, there was no difference in Ki-67 labeling index
between early lesions of BCC and non-neoplastic epidermis. The results were
unexpected, since FHIT expression has been reported to be lost in an above
mentioned study [11]. We concluded that FHIT expression remains to be positive,
at least in early lesions of BCC.

Anti-CD10 (56C6) is expressed variably in adrenocortical tumors and cannot be
used to discriminate clear cell renal cell carcinomas.

In the evaluation of retroperitoneal masses, the practicing pathologist faces a
dilemma when making a diagnosis based on histology given the often overlapping
morphologic appearances of the adrenocortical carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CD10 is expressed in a membranous
fashion in the vast majority of clear cell RCCs; therefore, it is widely used for
distinction from its mimics. However, its expression is not well-investigated in 
adrenal cortical tumors. We examined CD10 expression in 47 surgically resected
adrenocortical tumors (26 adenomas and 21 carcinomas) and compared with 20 clear 
cell RCCs and 25 HCCs. Twenty HCCs (80%), 18 RCCs (90%), 11 adrenocortical
carcinomas (52%), and 18 adrenocortical adenomas (69%) were positive for CD10.
HCCs were characterized by a canalicular staining, and clear cell RCCs exhibited 
membranous or mixed membranous-cytoplasmic staining. Adrenocortical tumors
displayed mainly cytoplasmic staining. Four adrenocortical carcinomas and one
adenoma also displayed the membranous staining pattern. Despite the relatively
small number of samples, our preliminary results revealed that adrenocortical
tumors may express CD10 (Clone: 56C6). The most important point from this paper
is the fact that anti-CD10 expression has not been previously reported in
adrenocortical carcinomas. This suggests that CD10 does not seem to be a useful
marker for discriminating clear cell RCCs from adrenocortical tumors since CD10
expression does not rule out the possibility of adrenocortical tumors. This
feature should be kept in mind when constructing an antibody panel for an
epithelial tumor that involves the adrenal gland and kidney, especially in small 
biopsy specimens.

AIM: The purpose of this study is to evaluate postmortem eye changes and to
investigate the relationship between these changes and time elapsed after death.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The eyes of 100 noncriminal cases who had died while being
treated at Eskisehir Osmangazi University (ESOGU) hospital were evaluated for
corneal turbidity and tache noire macroscopically, and also repeatedly evaluated 
by ophthalmoscope, pupilometer, and tonometer at intervals until removal from
hospital. The postmortem time, corneal turbidity, development of tache noire,
pupil size, intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus findings were recorded. The
relationship between these findings and the postmortem interval (PMI) was
evaluated.
RESULTS: No relationship between tache noire development and postmortem time (P >
0.05) was found. The corneal turbidity ratio increased significantly at 8 hours
after decease (P < 0.01). No relationship between right-left pupil size and
postmortem time (P > 0.05) was found. There was, however, a significant
relationship between the fundus findings and postmortem time. Over time, the
first optic disc becomes pale, then vascular clarity decreases and segmentation
increases. The right and left IOP related significantly to postmortem time and
decreased gradually as time passed (P < 0.05). Application of linear,
exponential, and power equations showed that IOP can be used to estimate
postmortem time by a 2 hour interval with a 95% probability.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that corneal turbidity and IOP have a significant
relationship with postmortem time and can be used to estimate a postmortem
interval with other postmortem findings. This study provides data that would
support the idea that such examination might be useful in estimating postmortem
interval.

Simvastatin is a hypocholesterolemic agent presumed to cause peripheral
neuropathy. We arranged an experimental design which focuses on the effect of
simvastatin on peripheral nerves and neural regeneration. Sciatic nerve injury
was performed at midthigh region of male wistar rats either by clamp compression 
or fine cut. Electrophysiological and electron microscopical studies were carried
out to assess the effect of simvastatin on peripheral nerve and nerve
regeneration. There was no difference between the groups that were given
simvastatin and standard regimen in the sciatic nerve when electrophysiological
measurements were concerned. However, some of the rats that were given
simvastatin show reduction in axoplasm density (intensity) of myelinated nerve
fibers and prominent vacuolization of myelin sheath according to light and
electron microscopic studies. Sciatic nerve compound muscle activation potential 
measurements of the animals given simvastatin showed that this drug doesn't have 
a delaying effect on the peripheral nerve recovery time. Electrophysiological
measurements showed that simvastatin did not influence nerve regeneration however
it was found to induce severe vacuolization of myelin sheath of the sciatic
nerve. It was apparent that the drug induces some form of structural dysfunction 
as myelin changes supported by electron microscopical studies.CONCLUSION:
simvastatin was shown to delay regeneration as shown in microscopic studies but
still there was no influence on nerve regeneration.

A proposed histopathologic classification, scoring, and grading system for renal 
amyloidosis: standardization of renal amyloid biopsy report.

Comment in
    Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2011 Feb;135(2):168; author reply 168-9.

CONTEXT: A disease associated with amyloid deposits, called amyloidosis, is
associated with characteristic electron microscopic appearance, typical x-ray
pattern, and specific staining. Renal involvement mainly occurs in AA amyloidosis
and AL amyloidosis and usually progresses to renal failure.
OBJECTIVE: The renal histopathologic changes with amyloidosis comprise a
spectrum. Clear relationships between the extent of amyloid deposition and the
severity of clinical manifestations have not been demonstrated. Whether there is 
a lack of clinicopathologic correlation is not clear, but studies have revealed
the need for standardization of the renal amyloid biopsy report. With these
objectives in mind, we proposed a histopathologic classification, scoring, and
grading system. Renal amyloidosis was divided into 6 classes, similar to the
classification of systemic lupus erythematosus. Amyloid depositions and other
histopathologic lesions were scored. The sum of these scores was termed the renal
amyloid prognostic score and was divided into 3 grades.
DATA SOURCES: AA amyloidosis was detected in 90% of cases, mostly related to
familial Mediterranean fever. Positive correlations between class I and grade I, 
class VI and grade III, and class III and grade II were observed. Also, a
positive correlation was identified between severity of glomerular amyloid
depositions, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation. Because of the inadequacy
of the patients' records and outcomes, different therapy regimes, and etiologies,
clinical validation of this study has not been completed.
CONCLUSIONS: Standardization of the renal amyloid pathology report might be
critical for patients' medication and comparison of outcome and therapeutic
trials between different clinics. Because of our AA to AL amyloidosis ratio and
the predisposition of familial Mediterranean fever-related AA amyloidosis, there 
is a need for further international collaborative studies.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a lysosomal enzyme found in the azurophilic granules of 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It is involved in the defense against periodontal
bacteria, and is also able to mediate inflammatory tissue destruction in
aggressive and chronic periodontitis. The aim of this study was to explore the
association between MPO-463G/A gene polymorphism and aggressive periodontitis
(AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP). The study included 147 subjects. Probing
depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), plaque index (PI), and gingival index
(GI) were recorded as the clinical parameters. Genomic DNA was obtained from the 
peripheral blood of 32 subjects with AgP, 25 with CP, and 90 reference controls. 
We genotyped the MPO-463G/A polymorphism using the PCR-RFLP method. All data were
analyzed using SPSS version 13.0 for windows. There were no significant
differences between the CP patients and controls regarding MPO-463A/G gene
polymorphism either in terms of allele frequency or genotype frequency of
MPO-463A/G. However, either in terms of allele frequency or genotype frequency of
MPO-463A/G, there were significant differences between the AgP patients and the
controls. In conclusion, our data suggest that MPO-463G/A may be associated with 
increased risk of aggressive periodontitis in Turkish patients.

Maspin, one of the serine protease inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit tumor
progression and metastasis. We aimed to investigate maspin, p53 and VEGF
expression in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma (AC)
and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The study included 28 SCC, 18AC, 17 SCLC
biopsy samples. We used the streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method to test
for maspin, p53 and VEGF antibodies. Medical records of these patients were
reviewed from archival files. Cytoplasmic maspin expression was detected in
89.3%, 77.8%, 52.9% of SCC, AC and SCLC, respectively. The rate was significantly
higher in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCC than SCLC (p = 0.013, p =
0.021, respectively). The mean percentages of maspin expression were
significantly higher in NSCLC, SCC and AC than in SCLC (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001, p
= 0.038, respectively). In ACs, maspin and p53 expressions were correlated,
although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.053, r = 0.464), and
maspin positive cases had a significantly higher T status compared to negative
cases (p = 0.036). In SCC, the stage of disease was positively correlated with
p53 (p = 0.007, r = 0.536) and negatively correlated with VEGF expression (p =
0.013, r = -0.498). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that stage of disease was 
a significant independent prognostic parameter in NSCLC (95% confidence interval:
1.067-3.969; p = 0.031). Although maspin expression is higher in SCC and AC, and 
is related with higher T status in AC, our data did not indicate its prognostic
significance. Larger scale studies are needed to reveal the exact role of maspin 
in lung cancer pathogenesis.

Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) is used in several commercial products such as
cosmetics, sunscreen, toothpaste and pharmaceuticals. However, some recent
investigations have revealed that titanium particles generate potential harmful
effects on the environment and humans. Because of its strong antioxidant
activity, ascorbic acid (AA) is admitted to act as an anti-mutagenic agent. The
present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of AA against
TiO(2)-induced genotoxicity. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE), micronucleus (MN)
and the comet assays were used to assess TiO(2)-induced genotoxicity and to
establish the protective effects of AA. There were significant increases (P<0.05)
in both SCE and MN frequencies of cultures treated with TiO(2) as compared to
controls. However, co-application of AA (4.87 and 9.73 μM) and TiO(2) resulted in
decreases of SCE and MN rates as compared to the group treated with titanium
alone. Besides, significant reductions of primary DNA damage (comet assay) were
determined when the AA was added to the cell culture medium simultaneously with
TiO(2). In conclusion, the preventive role of AA in alleviating TiO(2)-induced
DNA damage was indicated for the first time in the present study.

BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (cox) is the rate-limiting enzyme, which catalyzes the
conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and contributes to the
inflammatory process. Cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), which is one of the two isoforms,
plays a role in tumor progression and carcinogenesis. p53 contributes to
apoptosis, DNA renewal and cell cycle. Studies concerning the relationship of
cox-2 and p53 expressions and carcinogenesis are available, but the association
between cox-2 and p53 in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is not exactly known.In our study,
we examined the association of cox-2 and p53 expression, with age, stage,
histopathological subtype, and survival in HL. We also examined correlation
between cox-2 and p53 expression.
METHODS: Cox-2 and p53 expressions in Hodgkin-Reed Sternberg cells (HRS) were
examined in 54 patients with HL depending on cox-2 expression, stained cases were
classified as positive, and unstained cases as negative. Nuclear staining of HRS 
cells with p53 was evaluated as positive. The classifications of positivity were 
as follows: negative if<10%; (1+) if 10-25%; (2+) if 25-50%; (3+) if 50-75%, (4+)
if >75%.
RESULTS: Cox-2 and p53 expressions were found in 49 (80%) and 29 (46%) patients, 
respectively. There were differences between histological subtypes according to
cox-2 expression (p = 0.012). Mixed cellular (MC) and nodular sclerosing (NS)
subtypes were seen most of the patients and cox-2 expression was evaluated mostly
in the mixed cellular subtype.There were no statistically significant
relationships between p53 and the histopathological subtypes; or between p53,
cox-2 and the factors including stage, age and survival; or between p53 and cox-2
expression (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Considering the significant relationship between the cox-2 expression
and the subtypes of HL, cox-2 expression is higher in MC and NS subtypes. However
the difference between these two subtypes was not significant. This submission
must be advocated by studies with large series.

Imperforate hymen is a rare congenital malformation to present with symptoms in
the neonatal period. We present a case of a 5-day-old neonate with a marked
interlabial swelling causing urinary retention. Imaging revealed
hydrometrocolpos, hydrosalpinx, and bilateral hydronephrosis. Additionally, our
patient had polydactyly of both feet and hands, and laryngocele that have not
been previously described in literature. Hymenectomy is the mainstay of
management to prevent the development of hematocolpos, pain, and possible
retrograde menstruation.

P53 tumor suppressor protein is one of the pivotal regulators for genome
integrity, cell cycle and apoptosis. The most commonly and extensively studied
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of p53 is Arg>Pro substitution on codon 72
(R72P). Although we know that the SNP has unique functional effects on the
protein, its clinical significance is not clearly identified yet. Aim of the
study was to access the relationship between R72P genotype distribution and
clinical variables in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer
(CRC). Genomic DNA samples were extracted from 95 UC, 50 CRC, and 219 healthy
controls. R72P genotype analysis was carried out with polymerase chain reaction
following by restriction enzyme digestion. We observed that Pro allele carriage
is a strong risk factor for CRC (OR = 3.03; 95%CI = 1.91-2.40; p = 0.003), but
only modest association with UC (OR = 1.61; 95%CI = 0.98-2.65; p = 0.059)
(Pro/Pro and Pro/Arg genotypes vs. Arg/Arg genotype). We did not find any
correlation between genotype distribution of the polymorphism and clinical
parameters of CRC, but in UC, Pro/Pro genotype was significantly related to an
inflammatory bowel disease family history (OR = 8.0; 95%CI = 1.68-38.08, p =
0.015), and Arg/Pro genotype was significantly associated with the history of
disease-related colectomy (OR = 17.77; 95%CI = 0.98-323.34, p = 0.012) and
steroid use (OR = 10.14; 95%CI = 2.63-39.12, p = 0.0002). Our data suggest that
R72P variant seems to be associated with high risk for development of CRC but
carries low risk for development of UC. R72P genotypes might be a useful
predictive marker for surgical and medical treatment of UC.

Oncocytic parathyroid adenoma is a rarely seen benign neoplasm of the parathyroid
and intrathyroidal location of this lesion is also uncommon. It can be easily
misdiagnosed as Hürthle cell thyroid neoplasm on fine-needle aspiration (FNA).
Here, an intrathyroidal oncocytic parathyroid adenoma in a 32-year-old male is
reported. Ultrasonography showed a nodule 2 cm in largest diameter in the left
thyroid lobe. FNA revealed cellular smears containing monotonous oncocytic cells 
arranged in monolayered sheets, pseudopapillary structures and clusters within a 
rich vascular network. The case was reported as "suspicious for Hürthle cell
thyroid neoplasm" on FNA. Frozen section examination showed intrathyroidal
oncocytic parathyroid adenoma with a rim of normal parathyroid tissue. The
diagnosis was also confirmed with immunohistochemical stains (TTF-1, PTH,
thyroglobulin) performed on permanent sections. Cytopathologic features of
oncocytic parathyroid adenoma and Hürthle cell thyroid neoplasm are similar. It
is important to keep oncocytic parathyroid adenoma in mind in the differential
diagnosis of Hürthle cell thyroid neoplasm. Prior knowledge of clinical,
radiological and laboratory data will avoid wrong cytopathologic diagnosis.

Only 1% of gynecological neoplasms are vaginal, and mesenchymal tumors constitute
only 2% of vaginal neoplasms. The most common form is leiomyomas. Schwannomas
arise from the peripheral nerve sheath. We report a case of vaginal schwannoma
associated with uterine myoma. A 52-year-old woman presented with lower abdominal
pain and menorrhagia for a duration of 6 months. At sonographic examination, the 
patient was found to have uterine myomas and a solid mass measuring 5x4.5 cm
beneath the vaginal wall. At laparotomy, the uterus with myoma was removed using 
our standard operation procedures. Surgical excision of the mass from vaginal
aspect was also undertaken, and the histology demonstrated schwannoma. The tumor 
cells were vimentin (+), desmin (-), smooth muscle alpha-actin (-), HMB-45 (-),
MART-1 (-) and S-100 (+). There is no evidence of recurrence during 6 months
follow-up. The differential diagnosis of a mass in the vagina includes also
schwannomas. Immunocytochemical labeling of the tumor cells is essential. Simple 
resection of the mass is the preferred method of treatment.

Protective effects of coumarin and coumarin derivatives against carbon
tetrachloride-induced acute hepatotoxicity in rats.

The comparison of the antioxidant activity of some coumarins with their molecular
structure is well determined. However, the protective function of coumarins with 
various chemical structures against liver toxicity has not yet been well
established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible
cytoprotective properties of coumarin and some coumarin derivatives against
CCl(4) (carbon tetrachloride)-induced hepatotoxicity. Coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone) 
and coumarin derivatives esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin), scoparone
(6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) and 4-methylumbelliferone (7-hyroxy-4-methyl) were
examined for their protective effect against CCl(4)-induced hepatotoxicity in
Male Sprague-Dawley rats. A single toxic dose of CCl(4) (1.25 ml kg(-1), orally) 
produced liver damage in rats, seen histologically as centrilobular necrosis.
Administration of CCl(4) increased serum enzyme levels of aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Pre-treatment 
of rats with esculetin (31.15 mg kg(-1), orally) and scoparone (35 mg kg(-1),
orally) significantly prevented CCl(4)-induced increase in serum enzymes, whereas
4-methylumbelliferone (35 mg kg(-1)) and coumarin (30 mg kg(-1)) had no effect
against CCl(4)-induced rise in serum enzymes. Morphological findings were
consistent with the plasma transaminase observations. Among the coumarin analogs,
esculetin, which possesses orthodihydroxy coumarins, showed the strongest
protective effect against CCl(4)-induced liver damage, followed by scoparone,
4-methylumbelliferone and coumarin, respectively. The results of this study
indicate that the chemical structures of coumarins play an important role in the 
prevention of liver toxicity.

Universal markers of thyroid malignancies: galectin-3, HBME-1, and
cytokeratin-19.

Difficulties in diagnosis of thyroid lesions, even with histologic analysis, are 
well known. This study has been carried on to evaluate the role of
immunohistochemical markers including galectin-3, Hector Battifora mesothelial
cell-1 (HBME-1), and cytokeratin-19 in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis
of benign and malignant thyroid lesions. The expressions of galectin-3, HBME-1,
and cytokeratin-19 were tested in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 
458 surgically resected thyroid lesions including non-neoplastic and neoplastic
lesions. Immunostaining with standard avidin-biotin complex technique was
performed by using monoclonal antibodies. In malignant neoplastic thyroid
lesions, galectin-3, HBME-1, and cytokeratin-19 were diffusely expressed in
general. Diffuse expression rates of these three markers were 72.3% (47/65),
70.7% (46/65), and 76.9% (50/65), respectively. The use of galectin-3, HBME-1,
and cytokeratin-19 may provide significant contributions in the differential
diagnosis of malignant thyroid tumors. Although focal galectin-3, HBME-1, and
cytokeratin-19 expression may be encountered in benign lesions, diffuse positive 
reactions for these three markers are characteristic of malignant lesions. It has
concluded that cytokeratin-19 alone and its combinations with other markers were 
more sensitive in accurate diagnosis of papillary carcinoma than the other
combinations; meanwhile, there were similar results for follicular carcinomas
with HBME-1 alone and its combinations.

Morphometric studies in human pancreatic cancer argues against the etiological
role of type 2 diabetes in pancreatic cancer.

Saruc M(1), Iki K, Pour PM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gastroenterology, Acibadem University School of Medicine,
Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: To understand the role of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in type 2 
diabetes and pancreatic cancer (PC), we investigated the patterns of its
expression and its ratio to insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic
polypeptide cells by morphometry in tissues from these two diseases in comparison
to the normal pancreas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pancreatic tissues from 11 donors (five without pancreatic
disease and six with type 2 diabetes) and 11 surgical specimens from PC patients 
obtained from the cancer area (zone A) and the adjacent tumor-free area (zone B) 
were examined immunohistochemically. The size of islets, the number on beta-,
alpha-, delta- pp- and IAPP-expressing cells and their ratios in the islets of
these tissues were determined.
RESULTS: In the normal pancreas, only 50% of the beta-cells while alpha- and
delta-cells co-expressed IAPP only sporadically. In tissues from diabetics as
well as in zone A, the number of the beta-cells and the IAPP-expressing cells was
reduced significantly, while the number of alpha- and delta-cells was increased. 
In zone B, however, significantly more beta-cell and IAPP-expressing cells and a 
significantly lower number of alpha-cells were found compared to those in zone A.
Significant differences were also found between the specimens from type 2
diabetics and pancreatic cancer relative to the ratios of IAPP/beta-cell,
IAPP/alpha-cells and beta-cell/delta-cells.
CONCLUSION: The morphometric data show a decrease rather than an increase in the 
number of IAPP-expressing cells in PC. Differences in abnormalities in type-2
diabetics and in zone B of PC tissue strongly argue against the role of type 2
diabetes in PC. Rather, the development of diabetes in subjects prone to
pancreatic cancer could be a red flag for malignancy.

In the study, stereological, histological, and anatomical techniques were used to
investigate structural and morphometrical features of anencephalic and normal
fetal kidneys. Twenty human fetal kidneys (5 male and 5 female anencephalic
fetuses, and 5 male and 5 female normal fetuses) at gestational ages 30 to 35
weeks were examined. Our study used two basic research methods. One was
conventional anatomical measurement at the macroscopic level, such as volume,
length, weight, etc. The other consisted of conventional and modern microscopic
techniques. The microscopic techniques were based on two research methods:
histopathological examination at light microscopic level and stereological
estimations, including mean kidney volumes, obtained by the Cavalieri method, and
the total number and mean height of the glomeruli via the physical dissector
method. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of
width, height, weight, and fluid replacement volumes. Microscopic quantitative
assessment found no statistical differences either, in terms of the kidney
volumes and the number and height of the glomeruli. Our findings suggest that
kidneys from anencephalic infants may be a suitable alternative for renal
transplantation.

The present study investigated the expression of pulmonary surfactant proteins
(surfactant protein [SP]-A, SP-B, proSP-C), thyroid transcription factor-1
(TTF-1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the infiltration of CD3(+)
T and CD79alphacy(+) B lymphocytes into the lungs of 10 lambs naturally infected 
with sheep pox virus. Microscopical examination detected marked epithelial
hyperplasia, sheep pox cells and neutrophilic infiltration in pock nodules.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated intense expression of SPs in the cytoplasm of
the hyperplastic type II pneumocytes in the nodular pock lesions. These cells
displayed a gland-like arrangement. The hyperplastic and the normal bronchiolar
epithelium did not express SPs. The nuclei of the hyperplastic and normal type II
pneumocytes labelled positively for TTF-1. Strong PCNA positivity indicated
epithelial cell proliferation in the pock nodules. Moderate to abundant numbers
of CD3(+) T cells, but few CD79alphacy B lymphocytes, were detected in the pock
lesions. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the hyperplasia in the
pock nodules comprised predominantly type II pneumocytes and that the sheep pox
cells and epithelial cells contained virus particles in their cytoplasm. The
results of this study show that sheep pox virus induces marked proliferation of
type II pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells and that the lung lesions in
diseased lambs are mainly proliferative.

Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma (intranodal hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor 
with amianthoid fibers): a case report and literature review.

Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma (IPM) is a benign mesenchymal neoplasm
originating from smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts. It is characterized by
spindle cells, amianthoid fibers, and by the proliferation of
hemosiderin-containing histiocytes in the lymph node. A nodular lesion was
excised from the inguinal region of an 80-year-old male patient. Macroscopic
examination of a section of the lesion demonstrated a solid appearance with
hemorrhagic areas. Microscopic examination revealed spindle cell proliferation,
amianthoid fibers, hemosiderin pigment, and extravasated erythrocytes. Nuclei of 
the spindle cells displayed a palisaded appearance. Compressed lymphoid tissue
was observed around the lesion. With Masson's trichrome, spindle cells stained as
smooth muscle, whereas collagen staining was observed in homogeneous eosinophilic
accumulations. Neoplastic cells were identified by the presence of vimentin and
SMA. The Ki67 index was less than 1%. In light of these results, the case was
diagnosed as "intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma." IPM is an uncommon neoplasm
originating from the stromal component of the lymph node. Although IPM is benign,
it is frequently confused with metastatic lesions.

significance.

CD24 and galectin-1 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma and their
clinicopathologic significance remained largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate
expressions and staining intensities of CD24 and galectin-1 in gastric
adenocarcinoma and to investigate the interrelation with clinicopathologic
parameters including survival. 93 cases with gastric adenocarcinoma were
reevaluated histopathologically and immunohistochemistry was performed with
antibodies against CD24 and galectin-1. Staining intensities of both markers in
tumor cells and staining intensity of galectin-1 in tumor-associated stromal
cells were scored semiquantitatively. The relationship between expression and
staining intensity of CD24 and galectin-1 and clinicopathologic variables were
assessed. CD24 staining intensity was associated with lymphovascular invasion (p 
= 0.007), serosal invasion (p = 0.001), stage (p = 0.001) and lymph node
metastasis (p = 0.005). Galectin-1 staining intensity in tumor-associated stromal
cells was associated with tumor location (p = 0.031), lymphovascular invasion (p 
= 0.001), perineural invasion (p = 0.001), serosal invasion (p = 0.001),
differentiation (p = 0.003), stage (p = 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p =
0.001). Staining intensity of CD24 (p = 0.019) and gal-1 (p = 0.018) were
associated with patient survival. Staining intensity of CD24 in tumor cells and
galectin-1 in tumor-associated stromal cells were related with certain
clinicopathologic variables. Our findings suggest that these markers are
independent prognostic indicators of poor survival and may serve as useful
targets for novel therapies.

Corpses found in wells or lime pits must be identified and the cause and manner
of death must be determined. There are several circumstances that may lead to the
presence of corpses in wells. In this study, 3940 death examinations and
autopsies, performed at the Konya Branch of Forensic Medicine Council (Turkey)
between 2000 and 2007, were retrospectively investigated, and it was found that
18 (0.46%) of the bodies had been recovered from wells. The cases were evaluated 
in terms of their demographic features, manner of death (accidental, suicidal, or
homicidal), autopsy findings, cause of death, and the characteristics of the
wells in which they were found. The ages of the victims ranged from 4 to 74
years, and the average age was 40. 4 +/- 20.6 years. Of total, 16 cases were
males and 2 were females. The manner of death was determined to be accidental in 
10 of the cases, suicide in 6 of the cases, and homicide in the remaining 2
cases. In 7 of the cases, death had occurred as a result of drowning in water. A 
comprehensive scene investigation and autopsy must be performed for corpses
recovered from wells and pits for both identification and determination of the
cause and manner of death. Wells should be covered and kept closed at all times
to reduce the number of accidental deaths resulting from falls into wells.

Intraosseous soft tissue perineurioma: report of a vertebral example.

Sav A(1), Scheithauer BW, Taylor WA, Miller G, Stewart W.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Acibadem Medical Center, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a unique intraosseous perineurioma affecting the L2
vertebral body and pedicle of a 28-year-old female.
MATERIAL: A lytic, expansive lesion virtually limited to bone was gross totally
excised; only minimal epidural extension was noted.
METHODS: Histologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies were
performed.
RESULTS: The tumor was partially encapsulated, moderately cellular, and showed
classic features of benign soft tissue perineurioma, being composed of
interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with undulating nuclei and long, very
narrow, cytoplasmic processes. Immunohistochemistry showed reactivity for EMA,
Glut-1, claudin, collagen-4 and CD34; no S-100 or neurofilament protein staining 
was seen to suggest an origin in nerve.
CONCLUSION: Perineurioma, a tumor affecting soft tissue, and presumably
nerve-unassociated, may affect bone. No prior entirely osseous examples have been
reported. This tumor expands the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors of
bone.

Turkey. serdarb@hacettepe.edu.tr

Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix has 5 subtypes: endocervical, intestinal,
signet-ring cell, minimal deviation, and villoglandular. There are only rare
reports of primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the cervix in the literature.
Herein we report a 53-year-old woman with cervical adenocarcinoma with
signet-ring cell morphology. Thorough systemic examination did not reveal another
primary focus. DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissue revealed the presence
of human papilloma virus (HPV) type 18, which supports the cervical origin of the
tumor. Signet-ring cell morphology can be observed in both benign and malignant
lesions of the uterine cervix. Most of the malignant lesions are metastatic.
Histological features and immunohistochemical profiles are discussed, and a
review of signet-ring cell morphology in the uterine cervix is included.

Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. aylinegegul-34@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common malignancy of the
female genital tract. Gene alterations and overexpression of various oncogenes
are important in tumor development. The human HER 2 neu (c-erbB-2) gene product
is a transmembrane receptor with an intracellular tyrosine kinase that plays an
important role in coordinating the endometrial growth factor receptor signaling
network. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of c-erbB-2 in
endometrial cancer, to study its correlation to established prognostic parameters
and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of ER, PR and c-erbB-2 were performed
in 72 EC cases.
RESULTS: We detected a positive staining with c erbB 2 in 18.1% of the cases and 
determined a statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2 and PR. We could
not find a statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2 staining and ER.
There was not a statistically significant difference between c-erbB-2 and
histological grade. The highest level of c-erbB-2 was found in grade 2 cases.
There was not any statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2 and
menstrual status, myometrial invasion, lymph node status, stage and survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Although our study provides additional evidence of the potential
prognostic role of c-erbB-2, further prospective and controlled studies are
required to validate their clinical usefulness.

Cytopathologic differential diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and poorly
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma in bronchial lavage specimens using a
regression analysis.

The aim of this study was to determine the most significant cytologic features to
differentiate small cell carcinoma (SCC) from poorly differentiated non-small
cell carcinoma (NSCC) in bronchial lavage specimens. Bronchial lavage specimens
from 35 SCC cases and 63 poorly differentiated NSCC cases were examined and the
cytologic parameters reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-five cytologic features
considered useful in differential diagnosis were assessed. Statistical analysis
indicated that salt and pepper chromatin, small cell size and nuclear molding
have more than 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity for SCC cases. Logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the most effective criteria to
differentiate SCC from poorly differentiated NSCC are small cell size, salt and
pepper chromatin, prominent nucleolus and papilla formation. When these selected 
variables were used, sensitivity for predicting SCC was 94.3% and specificity
96.8%, and sensitivity for predicting NSCC was 96.8% and specificity 94.3%. There
are several cytologic features, which are highly sensitive and specific for
distinguishing SCC from NSCC. Nuclear features such as chromatin pattern, and
size of the nucleoli and nuclei are more valuable than cytoplasmic features to
distinguish between the two.

Suicide is a significant problem in the world. Sharing the information about the 
national suicide rates in the international scientific area is an important issue
for not only the solution of the problem, but also improving the efforts for
decreasing the suicidal deaths. We aimed to add the statistical information about
the rates, the risk factors, and the methods of suicides in Turkey to the
literature. The suicide rates in Turkey increased in the period between 1996 and 
2005 years; it was 3.8 per 100,000 populations in 2005. The average ratio of male
to female was 1.58/1 between 1996 and 2005 years. The suicidal deaths increased
above the age of 75, especially in male population. In females, the most
dangerous period was 15 to 24 age group. The major risk factor for suicides was
found to be illness (29.6%) for both genders and especially for above middle
ages. Hanging was the most preferred method for both genders and for most of the 
age groups in Turkey. Suicides increased in the spring and summer.

Odontogenic tumors constitute a group of heterogeneous disease derived from
epithelial, mesenchymal and/or ectomesenchymal elements. Ameloblastoma is the
best known and the most frequent form of odontogenic tumors. Calcifying
epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT), known as Pindborg tumor, is locally invasive
lesion which has a characteristic amiloid deposition. Here a case of a peripheral
ameloblastoma associated with CEOT is presented with clinical and morphological
features.

The real time PCR technique requires the normalization of the gene of interest to
reference genes that are accepted to be ubiquitously expressed. The choice of the
reference gene(s) needs to be determined by researchers according to the
particular tissue or model of interest. The best normalization gene is not easy
to decide, particularly if the investigated tissue displays architectural changes
and structural reorganization. We have investigated the expression of four
housekeeping genes that are widely used for the normalization purposes (TATA
binding protein, beta actin, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphorybosyl transferase and 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) in a skeletal muscle degeneration model
applied by the release of the Achilles tendon which leads to a time-course
degeneration of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. This study indicates that
the TATA binding protein and the beta actin gene to be the least effected in the 
course of degeneration induced by tenotomy in rat soleus and gastrocnemius
muscle.

Giant cell tumor-like lesion of the urinary bladder: a report of two cases and
literature review; giant cell tumor or undifferentiated carcinoma?

Giant cell tumor, excluding its prototype in bone, is usually a benign but local 
aggressive neoplasm originating from tendon sheath or soft tissue. Malignant
behavior is uncommon. Visceral organ involvement including urinary bladder is
rare. Giant cell tumors in visceral organs usually accompany epithelial tumors
and the clinical behavior of giant cell tumor in urinary bladder is similar to
its bone counterpart. Here, we report two cases of giant cell tumor located in
urinary bladder in comparison with nine reported cases in the English literature.
Concurrent noninvasive urothelial carcinoma was also described in all these
previous reports and only one patient with follow-up died of disease. One of the 
two cases we present had no concurrent urothelial tumor at the time of diagnosis 
but had a history of a low grade noninvasive urothelial carcinoma with three
recurrences. The histology of these two cases was similar to the giant cell tumor
of bone and composed of oval to spindle mononuclear cells with evenly spaced
osteoclast-like giant cells. Immunohistochemically, the giant cells showed
staining with osteoclastic markers including CD68, TRAP, and LCA.
Immunohistochemical expression of vimentin, CD68, LCA, and smooth muscle actin in
mononuclear cells supported a mesenchymal origin with histiocytic lineage. The
histologic and immunohistochemical properties in our cases as well as their
clinical courses were consistent with a giant cell tumor. Consequently, tumors in
urinary bladder showing features of giant cell tumor of bone may also be
considered and termed "giant cell tumor".

An unusual cause of death at preschool age: scalding by hot milk.

Cekin N(1), Akçan R, Arslan MM, Hilal A, Eren A.

Author information:

Scalding is one of the most painful and devastating burn injuries a child can
suffer. Victims are generally scalded by splashed or spilled hot fluids in the
home environment. Interestingly, scalding by hot milk is a common cause of burns 
in rural parts of Turkey. This study aimed to identify the general features of
scalding by hot milk, and to make the authorities aware of this problem through
educational programs for parents and caregivers.The records of the Council of
Forensic Medicine Adana Group Administration and public prosecutor's office were 
used. Forty-four deaths in children of preschool age (under 6) due to scalding by
hot milk during 2001-2005 were analyzed.Scalding with hot milk constituted 1.05% 
of all medico-legal deaths (4183) during the period considered. Twenty-five
(56.81%) of the victims were male while 19 (43.19%) were female. The victims'
ages ranged between 18 months and 6 years, with a mean age of 3.03.Scalding by
hot milk appears to be an important public health problem, especially in rural
areas of Turkey. Educational programs for families and caregivers and
implementation of simple safety measures will decrease the prevalence of deaths
due to such preventable injuries.

University, Antalya, Turkey.

The preventive and therapeutic effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on
diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rabbits have been investigated. Eighteen New
Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into three groups of 6 subjects each;
experimental group-I (EG-I) was administered a cholesterol rich diet,
experimental group-II (EG-II) was treated with EPA (300 mg/kg/d) following a
cholesterol-rich diet and the control group (CG) had a standard diet. Blood
samples were collected at day 0 and at the 4th and 12th weeks of EG-II to obtain 
serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), high density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C),
low density lipid-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG). From each group
tissue samples were collected from the carotid artery for immunohistochemistry
and electron microscopy. Our results showed that EPA could significantly lower
(p<0.001) serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels with a reduction of 35%; 55%; 44% 
and 51%, respectively. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy results
revealed that endothelial damage was more prominent in EG-I when compared to
EG-II. The ruptured endothelial lining and damaged cellular surface was increased
in EG-I when compared to EG-II. Ultrastructural observations showed that after
EPA treatment, the degeneration and cellular surface damage on the endothelium
were also decreased. These biochemical and ultrastructural results suggest that
EPA is a potential drug which significantly lowers the serum lipid profile and
partially repairs endothelial dysfunction due to hyperlipidemia.

Fine needle aspiration cytopathology of primary solid adenoid cystic carcinoma of
the lung: a case report.

Ozkara SK(1), Turan G.

Author information:

Turkey. emrecan1999@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, distinctive salivary gland 
malignant neoplasm arising infrequently as a primary tumor in the lung.
Cytomorphology of lung primary ACC has been rarely reported. To the best of our
knowledge, cytopathologic features of the solid type of ACC have not been
described as a primary lung tumor.
CASE: A case of solid-type primary pulmonary ACC arising in the upper segment of 
the left mainstem bronchus, suggestively diagnosed cytopathologically by
bronchoscope-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), is presented. Cytopathologic
differential diagnoses of ACC with other, more common primary neoplasms of the
lung are discussed. FNA smears exhibited a normocellular specimen with several
large, densely cellular tissue fragments and individual cells, homogeneous and
without prominent atypia. Nuclei were round to oval, with finely granular
chromatin. Nucleoli were either absent or inconspicious. The nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio was high. Cytoplasm was minimal; chromatin was bland, with rare
chromocenters. There was no nuclear molding. Staining the air-dried smears with
May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain revealed metachromatic, magenta material not in
spherules or cords but as shapeless structures surrounded by tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: A preoperative cytopathologic diagnosis of poorly differentiated
primary pulmonary ACC can enhance surgical planning and success of tumor
resection.

The nervous system has increased susceptibility for methanol intoxication. The
aim of this study is to investigate various central nervous system lesions of
methanol intoxication in 17 cases autopsied in the mortuary department of the
Council of Forensic Medicine in Istanbul, Turkey. The reasons of methanol
intoxication in the cases was likely the unwitting ingestion of methanol while
drinking illegal alcohol. Survival times ranged from several hours to days. In 8 
cases (47%), cerebral edema and in 9 cases (53%) at occipital, temporal and
parietal cortex, basal ganglia and pons, petechial bleeding was observed. In
addition to these findings, hemorrhagic necrosis were observed in thalamus,
putamen, and globus pallidus in 5 cases (29.4%) and, in cerebral cortex in
another 3 cases (17.6%). In 3 of the cases (17.6%) in which cerebral edema was
found, herniation findings accompanied to the situation and in 2 cases (11.7%),
pons bleeding was observed. Around the basal ganglia, in 2 of the cases with
hemorrhagic necrosis, the situation ended with a ventricular compression. In 7
cases (41%), the associated findings of chronic ischemic changes in cortical
neurons, lacunae formation, degeneration of granular cell layer of the
cerebellum, and reactive gliosis were considered as the results of chronic
alcoholism.

It has been shown that coal dust exposure stimulates inflammatory response
leading to increased release of cytokines from monocytes such as TNF-alpha and
IL1. These released cytokines play the key role in the pathogenesis of
pneumoconiosis including coal workers' pneumoconiosis. In this study, we
investigated TNFA, IL1A, IL1B and IL1RA genes variations on basal,
lipopolysaccharide and coal dust-induced cytokine release from blood monocytes of
homozygous allele and minor variant allele carriers in Turkish coal workers and
CWP patients. According to the genotyping results, TNFA -238 gene polymorphism
was found as a risk factor in CWP development (OR=3.79) and to in vitro results; 
release of both TNF-alpha and IL1 cytokines from the monocytes in CWP patients
was significantly increased compared to the healthy workers. Also, LPS and coal
dust stimulated release of TNF-alpha, which was significantly higher in allele 2 
carriers compared to subjects carrying allele 1 in both the groups. These data
suggest that the coal dust-induced release of TNF-alpha from monocytes may be a
useful biomarker of CWP.

Low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin are the most prescribed medical agents
as anticoagulants in pregnancy. Our objective was to investigate the effects of
antenatal use of low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin on pulmonary vascular
development in neonatal rabbits. Seven pregnant rabbits (42 newborn rabbits) were
divided into 5 groups as follows: control group (group 1, n = 14), heparin
treated (group 2, n = 8), heparin and aspirin treated (group 3, n = 7), only
aspirin treated (group 4, n = 6), and high-dose heparin treated (group 5, n =
12). Pulmonary histologic evaluations were carried out for all groups.
Angiogenesis was also tested by CD34 immunostained microvessel count (mvc).
Pathologic examination of pulmonary vasculature revealed that pulmonary vascular 
thickening occurred at the level of alveoli in heparin-, heparin- and aspirin-,
and high-dose-heparin-treated groups (groups 2, 3, and 5). The percentage of wall
thickness was different in groups 2 (26%), 3 (28.2%), and 5 (30.8%) compared with
group 1 (21.4%). Statistical differences were observed between group 1 vs 2, 3,
and 5. Microvessel count was also different between groups 2 (mvc = 90.5), 3 (mvc
= 90.2), and 5 (mvc = 96.3) vs group 1 (mvc = 86.7). The microvessel count was
statistically different between groups that received low-dose heparin vs
high-dose heparin. Antenatal administration of low-molecular-weight heparin
showed an effect on pulmonary vascular development. This effect may be explained 
by the influence of heparin on angiogenesis through placental growth factors.
Further experiments are needed to understand the pathophysiology of these
findings, and clinical studies are needed to correlate of these results.

Tumor budding is recognized as an adverse prognostic factor for a few carcinoma
types. We evaluated the importance of this finding in 64 laryngeal carcinoma
patients treated with surgery and radiotheraphy, with a median follow up of 53
(6-181) months. Budding was determined by re-evaluating hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)
stained tumor sections, and classified as mild, moderate, and marked. Budding was
not identified in 14 (21.88%) cases. Mild, moderate, and marked budding was
observed in 21 (32.81%), 15 (23.44%), and 14 (21.88%) cases, respectively. Only
when cases with marked budding were compared with the others, statistically
significant results were obtained. In patients with and without marked budding,
local disease-free survival, metastatic disease-free survival, and overall
survival were 71% and 97% (p=0.72), 77% and 93% (p=0.038), and 77% and 75%
(p=0.71), respectively. Marked budding was identified as a prognostic factor by
univariate analysis for distant metastasis-free survival. Multi-variate analysis,
by which well-recognized prognostic histopathologic parameters were evaluated,
revealed that only the number of metastatic lymph nodes and budding were
significantly associated with distant metastasis (p=0.02 and p=0.044),
respectively. These results suggest that budding might be a valuable prognostic
factor, particularly for distant metastasis in laryngeal carcinomas.

INTRODUCTION: According to the 2008 World Health Organization report, in 2006,
9.2 million new cases were determined, and 1.7 million people have lost their
life due to tuberculosis (TB) in all around the world. In our country (Turkey),
it is estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 people have TB disease annually. The
Ministry of Health could just determine 18,500 of these cases, and only 6500
patient could be treated effectively. According to the Tuberculosis Dispensary
records, the incidence for TB in Turkey is 28/100,000.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is aimed to determine the infection with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis using acidoresistant bacilli microscopy, TB culture, and
histopathological methods in tissue samples that were obtained from lungs of
forensic cases whose autopsies had been performed in Council of Forensic Medicine
Ankara Department Morgue Specialized Committee.
RESULTS: A total of 3 tissue samples that were obtained from lungs of randomized 
302 cases, were positive for TB in Löwenstein-Jensen medium. Granuloma with
caseating necrosis was found in histopathological examination and acidoresistant 
(+) bacilli (1+, 2+, and 2+, respectively) in microscopically analysis were also 
demonstrated in this 3 tissue samples.
DISCUSSION: For this reason, we think that autopsy workers have to be careful
about tuberculosis during their autopsy working.

Farm tractors are the major cause of occupational fatalities in agricultural
regions. Fatalities typically result from being run over or crushed by the
tractor, becoming entangled in the moving parts of the tractor, accidents on
roadways, and tractor rollovers, which involve the tractor tipping sideways or
backwards and crushing the operator. In this study, tractor-related fatalities in
the Konya province of Turkey are retrospectively evaluated. Out of the 3940 cases
on which a death examination and/or autopsy was performed between the years 2000 
and 2007 at The Konya Branch of Forensic Medicine Council, 86 (2.2%) of the death
cases were caused by tractor accidents and are included in this study. The ages
of the victims varied between 3 and 80 years old with a mean age of 31.7 + or -
22.3. Sixty-eight (79.1%) of the cases involved males, while 18 (20.9%) of the
cases involved females. In 32 (37.2%) of the cases, the deaths due to tractor
accidents occurred when the tractor overturned. In 37 (43.0%) of the cases, the
tractor-related fatalities involved the passengers and the drivers were involved 
in 34 (39.5%) of the cases. In conclusion, tractor accidents are preventable and 
deaths from tractor accidents can be significantly reduced if drivers are
required to wear safety belts and helmets and frequent checks are implemented to 
enforce the ban on carrying passengers.

Ligature strangulations are usually homicidal. Accidental and suicidal ligature
strangulations are quite rare. In this study, an unusual case of suicidal
ligature strangulation with a tourniquet method using a walking stick is
presented.A 70-year-old-man was found dead in his room, a piece of cloth wrapped 
around the neck, knotted, and tightened by a walking stick. His hand was still on
the walking stick which was seemingly used by him for a tourniquet effect.
Autopsy showed bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle hemorrhage. A thorough death 
scene investigation, detailed corpse examination, and autopsy are extremely
important for determining the manner of death in such ligature strangulation
cases.

Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic otitis media is a potentially serious disease because of its
complications, most of which are common in conjunction with cholesteatomas. There
is variance in the terminology used by neurosurgeons, otorhinolaryngologists and 
neuropathologists. Synonyms for cholesteatoma found in the literature include
epidermoid tumor, epidermoid cysts and epithelial inclusion cyst. Intracranial
extension of an acquired cholesteatoma is a rarely documented occurrence.
PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 47-year-old woman who had undergone a right
tympanomastoidectomy 20 years previously, presented with a long history of mild
headaches that had become progressively more severe over the last 3 years.
Clinical and radiological evaluation of the patient raised the suspicion of an
intracranial cholesteatoma.
RESULTS: A right temporal craniotomy was performed. The mass was completely
excised and histopathological study revealed the tumor to be a cholesteatoma. The
patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful.
CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatomas possess the capacity for eroding bone and can have an
insidious onset, but once established, grows relentlessly and destroys
neighboring structures. Since a gradual intracranial involvement does not usually
cause acute symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, the correct diagnosis
may be difficult. Detailed clinical and radiographic studies in particular are
diagnostically helpful. Because of the high incidence of delayed recurrence,
life-long follow-up is required. The inconsistency in the histopathological
classification of intracranial cholesteatomas should be clarified.

BACKGROUND: CD10 antigen is a 100-kDa-cell surface zinc metalloendopeptidase and 
it is expressed in a variety of normal and neoplastic lymphoid and nonlymphoid
tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate CD10 expression in urothelial
carcinoma of the urinary bladder and to determine the correlation between
immunohistochemical (IHC) CD10 expression and histopathologic parameters
including grade and stage.
METHODS: 371 cases of urothelial bladder carcinomas, all from transurethral
resections, were included in this study. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained sections 
from each case were reevaluated histopathologically according to WHO 2004 grading
system. The TNM system was used for pathologic staging. Selected slides were also
studied by IHC and a semiquantitative scoring for CD10 expression based on the
percentage of positive cells was performed.
RESULTS: 157 cases (42.3%) showed immunostaining while 214 cases (57.7%) were
negative for CD10. 1+ staining was seen in 65 CD10 positive cases (41.4%), and 2+
in 92 cases (58.6%). Overall CD10 expression as well as 2+ immunostaining was
significantly correlated with high histologic grade. Overall CD10 expression was 
also significantly higher in invasive pT1 and pT2-3 tumors compared to
noninvasive pTa tumors. pT1 and pT2-3 tumors were also significantly correlated
with 2+ immunostaining.
CONCLUSION: To date, only a few comparative IHC studies have assessed CD10
expression in urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder and this study
represents the largest series. Our findings indicate that CD10 expression is
strongly correlated with high tumor grade and stage in urothelial carcinoma of
the bladder, and that CD10 may be associated with tumor progression in bladder
cancer pathogenesis.

Konya, Turkey. sdemirci@selcuk.edu.tr

Suicide by ligature strangulation, which gives the initial impression of a
homicide, is very rare. In this article, 3 suicidal death cases caused by
ligature strangulation in Konya between 2001 and 2006 are presented. The first
victim was a 68-year-old man who suffered from depression and lived alone in a
cottage house. He terminated his life by applying a tourniquet to his neck after 
leaving a suicide note. The second victim was a 70-year-old woman who was found
dead on the floor of the living room in her house. After she cut the vessels in
her wrist, she tied pantyhose with 3 knots around her neck. It was reported that 
she had been intermittently receiving treatment for bronchial asthma and
depression for 20 years. The third victim was a 30-year-old woman who suffered
from schizophrenia for 6 years. She tied a scarf around her neck with 3 knots and
died in the hospital after 1 day due to "hypoxic brain syndrome." As a result of 
the death scene investigations, autopsies, and judicial inquiries, it was
concluded that death was by suicide in all 3 cases. Because the use of the
ligature strangulation method, and particularly the tourniquet method, in
suicidal cases is extremely rare in the literature, our aim is to present and
discuss these cases.

Postmortem findings after anaphylactic reactions to drugs in Turkey.

Yilmaz R(1), Yuksekbas O, Erkol Z, Bulut ER, Arslan MN.

Author information: 
(1)Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey. dr_riza_yilmaz@yahoo.com

AIMS: To determine the frequency of anaphylactic deaths at autopsies performed in
Turkey between January 2001 and June 2006 and to review the circumstances of
death and autopsy findings.
METHODS: The Council of Forensic Medicine database in Istanbul was searched for
anaphylactic deaths. Postmortem reports and medical records were reviewed to
determine the circumstances of death. Data about basic demographics, medical
history, drugs responsible for allergic reactions, and pathologic findings at
autopsy were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 36 anaphylactic deaths from drugs were identified for the
study period. Death was due to antibiotics in 26 cases, analgesics in 7 cases, an
intraoperative drug in 1 case, an H2 receptor in 1 case, and intravenous contrast
medium in 1 case. Out of 36 cases, 19 were male and 17 female. They were aged
between 1 and 74 years with the median age of 26.7 years. Death occurred within 1
hour of the onset of anaphylaxis in 27 cases. Findings at autopsy included
nonspecific pulmonary edema and congestion, upper airway edema, cerebral hypoxia,
and cutaneous edema. Serum tryptase levels were not measured in all cases.
CONCLUSION: Anaphylactic reaction is an uncommon cause of sudden death. In many
cases, no specific macroscopic or microscopic findings were detected at autopsy. 
When serum tryptase levels cannot be determined, in the presence of typical
clinical records, eye witness reports and autopsy findings can be useful
diagnostic aids.

The main aim of the study is to describe the human papillomavirus (HPV)
type-specific distribution in invasive cervical cancer (ICC) specimens from
Turkey. Paraffin-embedded ICC specimens were identified from the histopathologic 
archives of the Hacettepe University Medical School in Turkey. HPV detection was 
carried out through amplification of HPV DNA by a SPF-10 broad-spectrum primer
polymerase chain reaction and subsequently followed by DNA enzyme immunoassay and
genotyping by LiPA25 (version 1). Two hundred seventy-seven ICC cases diagnosed
between 1993 and 2004 were retrieved. After histologic evaluation and human
beta-globin gene analysis for sample quality, 248 cases were considered suitable 
for HPV/DNA testing. HPV prevalence was 93.5% (232/248; 95% confidence interval: 
90.5%-96.6%). The five most common HPV types identified as single types among
HPV-positive cases were HPV16 (64.7%), HPV18 (9.9%), HPV45 (9.9%), HPV31 (3.0%), 
and HPV33 (2.2%). The study shows that in Turkey, HPV16/HPV18 accounted for 75.4%
(95% confidence interval: 69.9%-81.0%) of HPV-positive ICC cases. This
information is essential to evaluate the potential impact of the HPV vaccines in 
the country.

Cyclooxygenase-2 expression and connection with tumor recurrence and
histopathologic parameters in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

Türköz HK(1), Alkan I, Sişman S, Ozcan D.

Tissue cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin
synthesis and has been shown to have roles in carcinogenesis and tumor
progression. Evaluation of COX-2 overexpression in malignancies has been
performed mostly on tumors of epithelial origin, and little is known about its
presence in mesenchymal tumors, especially gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GIST). COX-2 has been reported to be widely expressed in GIST and has been
suggested as a potential diagnostic marker. We evaluated the overexpression and
roles of COX-2 in tumorigenesis in GIST with regard to its relation to prognostic
parameters and tumor recurrence. We studied the presence of COX-2 expression
immunohistochemically and its relation to clinicopathologic prognostic variables 
in 41 cases of GIST. COX-2 was overexpressed in 21 (51%) of 41 tumors. The extent
of overexpression was greater in tumors that recurred after surgical resection.
COX-2 overexpression was also higher in tumors with coagulative necrosis, high
mitotic index and an infiltrative pattern of growth. The observation of greater
COX-2 expression levels in GIST with unfavorable histopathologic variables is
contrary to previous reports and consistent with the reported roles of COX-2 in
carcinogenesis of epithelial malignancies.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression 
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3), and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) in
gestational trophoblastic diseases to highlight the possible histogenesis.
Twenty-one partial hydatidiform moles (PHM), 19 complete hydatidiform moles
(CHM), 13 choriocarcinomas, and 20 nonhydropic spontaneous abortions (control
group) were evaluated with immunohistochemistry using VEGF, HIF-1alpha, TGFbeta1,
and TGFbeta3. The extent of immunohistochemical positivity (0%=0, 1-24%=1,
25-49%=2, 50-74%=3, and greater than 75%=4) and intensity (no staining=0, weak
staining=1, medium staining=2, and strong staining=3) were recorded. The
expression of VEGF in spontaneous abortions and choriocarcinoma was higher than
the expression in PHM and CHM. HIF-1alpha was strongly expressed in the
choriocarcinomas compared to the other subgroups. Nonhydropic spontaneous
abortions (control group) showed the highest TGFbeta1 expression levels among the
case subgroups, followed by PHM, CHM, and choriocarcinoma (p<0.001). The
expression of TGFbeta3 was seen in all groups, but the highest level of
expression was observed in both CHM and choriocarcinoma. We conclude that higher 
levels of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and TGFbeta3 expression in choriocarcinoma might be
involved in the development of trophoblastic diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the possible association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis
(HT) and cervical lymphadenopathy in cases diagnosed by fine needle aspiration
cytology.
STUDY DESIGN: Among the patients referred to our laboratory for ultrasound-guided
fine needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules (USG-FNAC), cases of HT
associated with cervical lymphadenopathy were evaluated.
RESULTS: Between February 2001 and May 2007, HT was diagnosed in 94 (11%) of a
total of 856 thyroid USG-FNAC cases. Among these cases, 22 (23%) were associated 
with single/ multiple cervical lymphadenopathy. In all cases, FNAC of the lymph
nodes was consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Anti-TPO and anti-Tg
antibody results were obtained in 14 of 22 cases with HT. Among these cases, 12
showed positive values.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians and cytopathologists who encounter thyroid nodules with
cervical lymphadenopathy should also include the possibility of HT in the
differential diagnosis. A literature search disclosed no report regarding the
possible association between HT and cervical lymphadenopathy. Considering the
limitations due to lack of immunocytochemical analysis of the thyroid and lymph
node aspirates, our study should be taken as a preliminary one.

The aim of the present study was to determine how the modified Gleason grading
(mGG) system affects the score discrepancy between needle biopsy (NB) and radical
prostatectomy (RP) and to investigate the effect of the modified scores on
nomogram predictions. When the conventional Gleason grading (cGG) and mGG systems
were compared, a new Gleason score was obtained in the NBs for 40 out of 97
patients (41.2%; P < .001) and in the RP specimens for 15 out of 97 patients
(15.5%; P = .005). The agreement between the NBs and RP specimens rose from 31.9%
to 44.3% with the mGG system (P = .017). However, when the predictions calculated
with the location of modified Gleason scores in the Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center nomogram were compared with those of the conventional Gleason
scores, higher pathological stage and lower life expectancy predictions were
obtained. Therefore, when a clinician is making a choice from therapeutic
options, this change should be taken into account.

Angiogenesis is a multistep process that depends on the balance of proangiogenic 
factors and inhibitors as well as on interactions with the extracellular matrix. 
We examined the immunohistochemical expression of the defining angiogenic agents,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),
and the antiangiogenic agent thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in 131 patients with
urothelial carcinoma and correlated their expression levels with
clinicopathological parameters. VEGF and MMP-9 expression was higher in
high-grade tumors than in low-grade tumors (p=0.000 and p=0.001, respectively),
whereas the reverse was true for TSP-1 (p=0.000). VEGF and MMP-9 expression was
higher in deeper tumors compared to superficial tumors and in invasive tumors
compared to non-invasive tumors (p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively), while TSP-1 
was lower (p=0.000). We could differentiate 22 of 41 muscle-invasive (T2) cases
as superficial (T2a; n=7) or deep (T2b; n=15), but no difference was found
between them regarding VEGF, MMP-9, or TSP-1 expression (p=0.783, p=0.289, and
p=0.783, respectively). There was a positive correlation between VEGF and MMP-9
expression (p=0.008, r=0.23) but a negative correlation between MMP-9 and TSP-1
expression (p=0.014, r=-0.21). Increased VEGF and MMP-9 expression as well as
decreased TSP-1 expression may play considerable roles in the invasion and
differentiation of urothelial carcinoma.

Verrucous carcinoma of the female tract is rare. We present a case involving
association of verrucous carcinoma of the cervix with uterine prolapse. A
86-year-old woman was admitted with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. The
gynecologic examination revealed the uterine prolapse with a exophytic tumorous
mass (3 x 6 x 8 cm) on the cervix. A punch biopsy was taken from the tumor, which
revealed coilocytotic and mild dysplastic changes in the squamous epithelium;
invasion of the underlying stroma could not be evaluated. A cervical swab was
tested for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using the polymerase chain reaction,
and HPV type 31 was detected. The tumorous mass was totally excised. The
histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with verrucous carcinoma of the cervix: 
exophytic lesion was composed of thickened, acanthotic papillary squamous
epithelium with mild dysplasia and diffuse parakeratosis, and no obvious invasion
was observed. The patient was periodically controlled by pelvic examination and
was free of progressive disease at 6 months. The diagnosis and treatment of
verrucous carcinoma of the cervix may be difficult in some cases. The presence of
HPV type 31 in our case might indicate the possibility that HPV is the etiology
of this neoplasm.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 polymorphism in patients with
rheumatic heart disease.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a systemic inflammatory disease occurring as a
consequence of an exaggerated immune response to group A, beta haemolytic
streptococcal pharyngitis. The molecular mimicry between human target
organs/tissues and specific components of the infectious organism leads to the
development of autoimmune reactions and cardiac tissue damage in rheumatic heart 
disease (RHD). Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a negative
regulator of T cell activation and proliferation during the immune response.
CTLA-4 gene polymorphism has been shown to affect the inhibitory function of
CTLA-4. We aimed to analyze the association of CTLA-4 gene locus at position 49
of exon 1 with susceptibility to ARF/RHD. This study included a total of 98
patients with RHD as a sequela of ARF, who fulfilled the revised classification
criteria of Jones and 154 healthy unrelated controls. CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism
was genotyped by using PCR-RLFP technique. Data was analyzed by binary logistic
regression models. The frequencies of GG, GA and AA genotypes were found to be
14%, 47% and 39%, respectively, in patients and 6%, 45% and 49%, respectively, in
controls. The GG genotype was found to be significantly different between
patients and controls (OR: 3.11; P = 0.016). GA and AA genotypes did not
statistically differ between patients and controls. Our data showed a significant
association of +49G /G polymorphism in a small patient group with RHD.

Oxalosis, deposition of calcium oxalate in tissues, is the final stage of
hyperoxaluric syndromes. Being a rare entity, it is often missed, or the
diagnosis is delayed, since the definitive diagnosis requires special laboratory 
tests. Kidneys, the walls of blood vessels, and bones are the major sites for
crystal deposition. We report the autopsy findings of a 4-year-old girl who
presented with end-stage renal disease in which the clinical presentation was
consistent with primary hyperoxaluria Type I. The case is unusual, as there was
extensive crystal deposition throughout the body, including in tissues that are
rarely involved, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, thymus, salivary
glands, pancreas, and bladder.

Meningioma is a common neoplasm that constitutes almost 30% of all primary
central nervous system tumors and is associated with inconsistent clinical
outcomes. The extracellular matrix proteins play a crucial role in meningioma
cell biology and are important in tumor cell invasion and in progression to
malignancy. SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) (osteonectin)
is a matricellular glycoprotein that regulates cell function by interacting with 
different extracellular matrix proteins. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the expression of SPARC with proliferation index, p53 reactivity in WHO grade 1
(benign), grade 2 (atypical) and grade 3 (anaplastic) meningiomas and correlate
with clinical features of the patients, including location of the tumor,
recurrence of the tumor and survival of patients. We studied 111 meningiomas, 69 
being benign, 34 being atypical and eight being anaplastic meningiomas of various
histological types. Using immunohistochemical analysis, we evaluated the
expression of SPARC, Ki-67 (MIB-1) and p53 in meningiomas. Immunohistochemical
scores of SPARC were determined as the sum of frequency (0-3) and intensity (0-3)
of immunolabeling of the tumor cells. A high immunohistochemical score (4-6) for 
SPARC was more frequent in atypical and in anaplastic meningiomas than in benign 
meningiomas (p < 0.01). MIB-1 proliferation index showed significant association 
between tumor grades in meningiomas (p < 0.01). At the end of a follow-up period 
of 47.53 +/- 25.04 months, 30 tumors recurred. A high SPARC expression was
significantly associated with tumor recurrence (p = 0.02). The immunoreactivity
of p53 protein and MIB-1 score were significantly higher in recurrent meningiomas
than in non-recurrent meningiomas. The cumulative survival of patients with high 
SPARC expression was significantly lower than patients with low SPARC expression.
The high SPARC expression scores were predominantly identified in meningothelial,
fibrous and chordoid meningiomas; low SPARC expression scores were mostly spotted
in secretory and psammomatous meningiomas. Evaluating SPARC expression might help
assessing recurrence risk and survival estimation in meningiomas.

Diagnostic dilemma in cytologic features of micropapillary carcinoma of the
breast: a report of 2 cases.

Kelten EC(1), Akbulut M, Duzcan SE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Pamukkale University School of Medicine, Denizli,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a rare type of breast
carcinoma with unique mophologic features and high frequency of axillary lymph
node metastasis. Recognizing the IMPC on cytology makes it possible to identify a
group of patients with a poor prognosis and may alter the adjuvant treatment.
CASES: We reviewed the cytologic features of a 2 IMPC cases 50-year-old women.
Both cases included conventional findings of IMPC, such as increased cellularity,
cell clusters with angular and papillary configuration without a fibrovascular
core, tumor clusters showing an "inside-out" pattern and the presence of single
discohesive cells. Of interest, both cases included a few malignant-appearing
multinucleated giant cells. The slides of 1 case were included a little mucin in 
the background of tumor diathesis. There were no psammoma bodies in the smears.
CONCLUSION: The cytologic features of IMPC are unique and should be recognized
because of its' tendency to infiltrate the axillary lymph nodes. In addition to
well-known cytologic features of IMPC, multinucleated giant cells and a scanty
amount of mucin should also alert the cytopathologist to the possibility of IMPC.

To investigate the effectiveness oftoluidine blue-stained wet films in
preliminary cytologic evaluation of bronchial washings.STUDY DESIGN: Bronchial
washings were obtained by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy from 179 patients with
suspected bronchial carcinoma. Each sample was evaluated with toluidine
blue-stained wet films as benign, suspicious or malignant, and the diagnoses were
compared to results of conventional smears and cell blocks. The sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of wet films
were determined.
RESULTS: Of 179 samples, toluidine blue stains from 18 samples were classified as
malignant, 4 samples as suspicious and 157 samples as benign. The sensitivity of 
the wet films was 83.3%, specificity was 98.7%, positive predictive value was
90.9% and negative predictive value was 97.5%.
CONCLUSION: Initial cytologic evaluation of bronchial washings with toluidine
blue-stained wet films is simple, fast and inexpensive. Moreover, it provides
guidance for additional procedures for the definitive diagnosis.

Suicide notes are commonly written on some materials, such as notebooks, papers, 
and mirrors. Additionally, suicide plans have been communicated in face-to-face
conversations, by speaking on the telephone, recording on CDs or video cassettes,
and sending messages through text messaging. In this article, 2 suicide death
cases are presented in which suicide notes were written on the bodies of the
victims. The first case, a 32-year-old man, was a university graduate and had
been unemployed for years; he committed suicide in his house by hanging. On the
external examination, it was seen that there were some words on the body written 
with a pen; specifically "DONKEY" was written on the forehead; coursing
up-and-down along the chest, "HODJA" was on the right, "DO NOT" was on the
sternal region, and "WASH" was on the left; and undecipherable handwritings were 
on both zygomatic regions. The second case, a 39-year-old woman, was a housewife 
who was being physically abused by her husband and committed suicide by ingesting
an insecticide. It was observed that on the left leg, a note was written with a
pen saying that she could not stand being beaten by her husband on account of the
inheritance dispute between him and her elder brother; there was purple
ecchymoses in the periphery of the right eye and in the right gluteal area. Since
we have not found any reports of suicide notes written on the body in the
literature, we present and discuss our cases herein.

We report a case of an accidental decapitation of an agriculture worker in a
field. The scene investigation revealed that the worker had loosely tied a scarf 
tied over his face in an attempt to diminish his exposure to barley dust, to
which he was allergic, while distributing the barley loads with a shovel upon a
trailer. The trailer was simultaneously being loaded by a helix elevator machine 
and its rotating shaft suddenly caught the victim's scarf and pulled it down to
the victim's neck. The rotating motion immediately tightened the scarf around the
neck resulting in hanging/strangulation noose that, by continued tightening,
caused decapitation of the victim. The victim's body was found on the ground by
the trailer and the victim's head was discovered in the barley load in the
trailer. Examination revealed that the neck was severed at the level of the
second and third cervical vertebrae.

CCM2 and CCM3 proteins contribute to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in human
placenta.

Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.

Placenta as an ideal model to study angiogenic mechanisms have been established
in previous studies. There are two processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis,
involved in blood vessel formation during placental development. Therefore, blood
vessel formation is a crucial issue that might cause vascular malformations. One 
of the vascular malformations is cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) in the
central nervous system, consisting of endothelium-lined vascular channels without
intervening normal brain parenchyma. Three CCM loci have been mapped as Ccm1,
Ccm2, Ccm3 genes in CCM. In order to investigate whether CCM proteins participate
in blood vessel formation, we report here the expression patterns of CCM2 and
CCM3 in developing and term human placenta by means of immunohistochemistry and
Western blot analysis. CCM2 and CCM3 were obviously detected in the vascular
endothelium during early pregnancy. Moreover, vascular endothelium of stem villi 
revealed a moderate immunostaining for CCM2 and, to a lesser extent, in the
endothelium of mature intermediate villi in term placenta. Interestingly, CCM3
immuno-staining was weakly localized in the endothelium of mature intermediate
villi and showed lesser expression going toward stem villi in term placenta. The 
expression patterns of the proteins were clearly identified in the vascular
endothelium of human placenta, suggesting that they might play roles during
angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Furthermore, with this study, CCM2 and CCM3 have
been described for the first time in the human placenta.

The occurrence of granulomatous reactions within lymph nodes that drain
carcinomas is well known but uncommon. Even more rarely, granulomas may occur
within the stroma of tumors. These lesions, called sarcoid-like reactions,
commonly accompany carcinomas but are very rare in sarcomas. This study presents 
a case of classic Kaposi sarcoma that contained sarcoid-like granulomas, with a
literature review. A soft tissue lesion of the foot was excised from a
74-year-old male. Histopathological examination showed that the tumor tissue
consisted of spindle cells, areas of atypical vascular proliferation, and
extravasated erythrocytes surrounded by non-caseating granulomas. The patient had
no clinical or laboratory findings of sarcoidosis. The case was interpreted as
"Kaposi sarcoma containing sarcoid-like granulomas". The association of soft
tissue sarcomas with a granulomatous reaction is very rare. A granulomatous
reaction is reported to be a good prognostic indicator in several carcinoma
types, although its importance in sarcomas is unclear.

Spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma is an infrequently seen benign adipose tissue
tumor. This tumor, mostly arising from the subcutaneous tissue, usually affects
male patients and occurs in back, shoulders, head and neck area. It is rarely
localized to dermis. Cutaneous spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma differs from its
subcutaneous counterpart by wider anatomical distribution, female predilection
and infiltrative margins. We here present a pedunculated type, cutaneous
pleomorphic lipoma case localized to the nasolabial region of 59-year-old man.

Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL) is an indolent low grade 
B cell lymphoma of the skin, with lack of extracutaneous involvement at the time 
of diagnosis. Herein we report the case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) who developed symmetrical PCMZL lesions on both ear lobes. Lesions occurring
symmetrically on ear lobes are more specific for cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia
(CLH) and this kind of symmetrical localization hasn't been reported for PCMZL
before. PCMZL is considered to arise from a background of reactive lymphoid
hyperplasia and this case point out the concept of CLH and PCMZL spectrum.
Association of marginal zone lymphoma with rheumatoid arthritis and resolution of
lesions together with the resolution of symptoms due to rheumatoid arthritis
after rituximab therapy is another interesting point for this case. To the best
of our knowledge PCMZL associated with RA has not been reported previously.

Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency affecting not only the ipsilateral ovary 
but also contralateral ovary. Although the conventional treatment is
salpingo-oophorectomy, recent studies advocate detorsion. We hypothesized that
iloprost, an analogue of prostacyclin with cytoprotective properties, may prevent
the harmful effects of ischaemia-reperfusion injury in bilateral ovaries after
unilateral ovarian torsion-detorsion in rat. In this study, 24 female
Wistar-albino female rats were divided into four groups. Ovarian torsion was
produced by applying vascular clamps to right ovaries. In Group I, bilateral
oophorectomy was performed. In group II, bilateral oophorectomy was performed
after a unilateral torsion period of 4h. In group III, bilateral ovaries were
removed, following unilateral torsion-detorsion periods each lasted for 4h.
Saline was injected i.p. 30 min before detorsion. In group IV, same experimental 
protocol, which was conducted in group III, was repeated. Iloprost was injected
i.p. 30 min before detorsion instead of saline in group IV. Tissue levels of
malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), which are the indicators for
oxidative stress were determined and histopathological evaluation was performed
in bilateral ovaries in all groups. The MDA and NO levels for ipsilateral ovaries
of four groups were compared and no significant difference was found (p>0.05).
The same comparison were done for the contralateral sides and no difference was
seen either (p>0.05). In histological examination, iloprost produced improvement 
in I/R-induced alterations in ipsilateral and contralateral ovaries. In
conclusion, these results showed that iloprost has beneficial effect on the
histological appearances in both the ipsilateral and contralateral rat ovaries
after unilateral torsion-detorsion.

Comment in
    J Oral Pathol Med. 2010 Jul;39(6):510; author reply 511.

BACKGROUND: Although number, frequency and healing time of oral ulcers and pain
are generally used for clinical practice and studies in Behcet's disease (BD) and
recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), no standardized activity index is currently 
present to monitor clinical manifestations associated with oral ulcers. The aim
of this study was to develop a standardized composite index (CI) to assess oral
ulcer activity in BD and RAS.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 121 patients with BD and 45 patients with
RAS were included. Sixty-five percentage of BD and 68.9% of RAS patients were in 
active stage during the previous 3 months. The developed CI included the presence
of oral ulcers, ulcer-related pain and functional status and was evaluated in
patients with both active and inactive disease for content validity.
RESULTS: Composite index score was observed to be higher in active patients with 
RAS (6.94 + or - 2.19) compared with active BD patients (6.01 + or - 2.04) (P =
0.04). The number of oral ulcers and healing time of oral ulcers were
significantly higher in RAS compared with BD (P = 0.018, P = 0.001 respectively).
CI score correlated with the number of oral ulcers in both BD and RAS (P = 0.000,
P = 0.002 respectively). CI score was '0' for inactive patients without oral
ulcer in BD and RAS.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented CI as an oral ulcer activity index seems to be a
reliable and suitable tool for evaluating the clinical impact and
disease-specific problems in BD and RAS.

This study was performed to compare osteopontin (OPN), beta-catenin and
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein B1 (hnRNP B1) immunreactivities in small 
cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC).
Correlation of these three antibodies with grade and clinicopathologic stage of
the tumor in NSCLC was also investigated. Twenty-nine SCLC, 6 large cell
carcinoma, 36 adenocarcinoma and 30 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), totally 101
cases, were included in this study. OPN, beta-catenin and hnRNP B1 expressions
were immunohistochemically evaluated. OPN positivity was 6.9% in SCLC and 67% in 
NSCLC. When NSCLC types were individually considered, OPN positivity was 66.7% in
large cell carcinoma, 80% in SCC and 55.6% in adenocarcinomas. beta-catenin
positivity was observed in 48.6% of NSCLC and none of SCLC cases. These results
were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Neither grade nor stage of NSCLC was
correlated with osteopontin, beta-catenin or hnRNP B1 immunreactivity. We
observed that OPN and beta-catenin are useful in differentiating SCLC from NSCLC.
This may be helpful in small lung biopsies where morphology is obscured by crush 
artifacts.

Sweet's syndrome (SS) or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is an uncommon
disorder that often occurs in association with other systemic diseases. In its
systemic manifestation, SS resembles familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in many
aspects. Although the exact pathogenesis of SS and FMF is not yet clear, their
clinical similarities and simultaneous occurrence suggest a possible common
underlying mechanism and may represent a continuum of a reactive neutrophilic
condition.

The expression of p63 and p53 in keratoacanthoma and intraepidermal and invasive 
neoplasms of the skin.

p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene, and its mutation is a common event in 
intraepidermal and invasive neoplasms of the skin. p63 is a homologue of the
tumor suppressor gene p53, which is expressed in human basal squamous epithelium,
and despite its homology to p53, it is considered to act as an oncogene. We
evaluated p63 and p53 expression in usual skin cancers, including basal cell
carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), keratoacanthoma (KA), and
intraepidermal neoplasms, including Bowen's disease (BD), actinic keratosis (AK),
malignant melanoma in situ (MM in situ), and Paget's disease (PD) to clarify the 
putative role of p63 and p53 in the development and differential diagnosis of
these lesions. Seventeen SCC, 23 BCC, 16 KA, 26 AK, 22 BD, 7 MM in situ, and 6 PD
were included in this study. We determined decreasing p63 staining in BD, AK,
BCC, SCC, and KA, respectively. None of the MM in situ and PD was positive for
p63. The mean p53 staining was highest in BD, followed by AK, SCC, PD, KA, BCC,
and normal skin. There was no correlation between the groups in terms of p63 and 
p53 staining. Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may be helpful in
the differential diagnosis of BD and AK versus MM in situ and PD, particularly in
small biopsies.

Is D2-40 a useful marker for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from pulmonary
adenocarcinoma and benign mesothelial proliferations?

haleden2000@yahoo.com

Since pulmonary adenocarcinomas, malignant mesotheliomas (MM), and sometimes
benign mesothelial proliferations show a great histomorphological resemblance to 
each other, an immunohistochemical panel is usually necessary for differential
diagnosis. D2-40 is an available monoclonal antibody, which is already in use as 
a lymphatic endothelial marker. It has also been suggested to be useful in
identifying the mesothelial differentiation. The aim of this study is to compare 
D2-40 immunostaining in MM, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and benign mesothelial
proliferations. In this retrospective study, D2-40 immunostaining was
investigated in 37 cases of MM, 36 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and 31
cases of benign mesothelial proliferation. The diagnosis of MM had previously
been confirmed by a panel including calretinin, CK5/6, and CEA. Predominantly
membranous immunoreactivity was observed in 51% of MMs and in 55% of benign
mesothelial proliferations. All the 36 pulmonary adenocarcinomas were negative.
These results were statistically significant (p<0.001). We believe that D2-40 may
be helpful in the differential diagnosis of MM from pleural involvement of
pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Because of the poor sensitivity of urinary cytological findings for
the diagnosis of especially low grade urinary bladder carcinoma, new molecular
diagnostic methods have been proposed. We decided to verify the ImmunoCyt/uCyt+
(UCyt+) test and cytology combination and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and cytology
combination in urine as possible diagnostic and monitoring tool for bladder
cancer.
METHODS: Evaluation of CK20 expression and UCyt+ was performed in urine of 90
patients of which 54 with bladder cancer with primary/recurrent diagnosis (low
grade urothelial carcinoma (LGUC) = 23/8 patients, high grade urothelial
carcinoma (HGUC) = 18/5 patients), and 36 patients as control; except of
neoplastic bladder disease patients. For the evaluation of the three tests, CK20 
and UCyt+ tests were combined with urine cytology and compared with each other.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity detected for each tumor marker was as follows:
for urine cytology was 75.9% and UCyt+ was 83.3%, for CK20 70.4%, while the
specificity was 66.7% for urine cytology and 86.1% for UCyt+ and 83.3% for CK20. 
The sensitivity of cytology and UCyt+ combination was higher (88.9%) than the
sensitivity cytology and CK20 combination (77.8%). The simultaneous use of the
three markers, sensitivity was reaching 92.5%.
CONCLUSION: The UCyt+ test and CK20 expression are valid tools for the
performance of adjunctive analyses with conventional cytologic examination.

Do cyst wall thickness and cyst size have any effect on the intra-operative
inadvertent rupture of echinococcal hydatid cyst of central nervous system?

(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Göztepe Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul,

Our primary aim was to investigate whether there is any association between
thickness of the hydatid cyst's wall and size and whether it has any effect on
intact removal of the cyst, independent of the surgeons' technique. Sixteen cases
of echinococcal hydatid cyst of the central nervous system, operated on between
1991 and 2007 by various surgeons, were examined. Cyst diameter was directly
measured on the specimen or calculated on radiological scans. Histological
preparations were made identically by cutting 5-microm-thick longitudinal
sections from paraffin blocks of formalin-fixed tissue and stained with HE. Wall 
thickness was measured using a micrometer by the same pathologist blinded to the 
measurements of cyst diameter. Cyst diameter and wall thickness correlated
negatively (the larger the cyst the thinner the cyst wall); however this was not 
statistically significant. Neither the cyst size nor the wall thickness proved to
be statistically significant as a factor having an effect on intact removal of
the cyst. In conclusion, the cyst size and wall thickness do not have any effect 
on the intact removal of hydatid cyst. It seems that the use of appropriate
surgical techniques play the most effective role in outcome of hydatid cyst
surgery.

OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic renin-angiotensin system has been implied to play a role in
the regulation of pancreatic functions and could be a new therapeutic target in
acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition by captopril and
angiotensin II type 1 receptor inhibition by L-158809 and losartan experimentally
in acute pancreatitis.
DESIGN: Rats were randomly divided into 15 groups. Acute edematous pancreatitis
was induced by injection of cerulein 20microg/kg SC four times at hourly
intervals. Severe necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by retrograde injection of
3% taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct.
INTERVENTIONS: Captopril, L-158809 and losartan were given intraperitoneally.
Main outcome features: pancreatic pathology, pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity 
and serum amylase activity were assessed.
RESULTS: Captopril decreased serum amylase (10,809+/-1867 vs. 4085+/-1028U/L,
p<0.01), myeloperoxidase activity (3.5+/-0.5 vs. 1.5+/-0.1, p<0.05) and
histopathological score (5.0+/-0.4 vs. 1.1+/-0.5, p<0.01) in acute edematous
pancreatitis. In taurocholate induced severe necrotizing pancreatitis captopril
ameliorated histopathological score (10.1+/-1.2 vs. 3.4+/-0.5, p<0.01),
pancreatic parenchymal necrosis (4.5+/-0.6 vs. 0.0+/-0.0, p<0.001), fatty
necrosis (2.8+/-0.9 vs. 0.1+/-0.1, p<0.01) and edema (2.1+/-0.3 vs. 1.4+/-0.3,
p<0.05). However, L-158809 did not have similar beneficial effects on acute
pancreatitis in rats while losartan decreased pancreatic parenchymal necrosis and
neutrophil infiltration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study not only demonstrated the differential effects of
captopril, losartan and L-158809 in acute pancreatitis but also showed that there
is still much to investigate about pancreatic renin-angiotensin system.
Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme should be evaluated carefully as a
potential new therapeutic target in acute pancreatitis.

Adverse effects of desensitization injections mostly consist of local transient
reactions. Rarely, persistent subcutaneous nodular lesions may also develop at
the site of injection. These reactions have been attributed to the vaccines
containing aluminium hydroxide. Aluminium hydroxide is used as an adjuvant in
vaccines and hyposensitization solutions. We describe a patient who presented
persistent, itchy subcutaneous nodules as a local reaction to allergen
immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic asthma.

We report a rare case of ependymoma with vacuolar features, signet cells,
pigmentation and numerous Rosenthal fibers arising in the fourth ventricle of a
35-year-old woman. The tumor was composed of cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles,
signet cells and clear cells. The clear cells were compactly arranged resembling 
oligodendroglioma. Pseudovascular and ependymal rosettes were observed only in
focal areas. Additionally, some tumor cells contained brown cytoplasmic pigment, 
which was histochemically compatible with lipofuscin and neuromelanin. On
immunohistochemical examination, the tumor cells were positive for S100, glial
fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, and negative for synaptophysin,
cytokeratin, neurofilament and HMB45. Epithelial membrane antigen staining showed
dot-like and small vesicular reactivity. The case is presented to increase
familiarity with these extraordinary variants of ependymoma.

SUMMARY: The diagnosis of malignant, uncertain malignant potential, and benign
uterine smooth muscle tumors is derived from histologic criteria such as tumor
cell necrosis, mitotic activity, and cytologic atypia. Morphologically, some
variants of leiomyoma can be confused with leiomyosarcoma (LMS). In this study,
we compared fascin expression in cases of leiomyoma, leiomyoma variants (LVs),
uterine smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), and LMS,
and sought to determine the potential role of fascin in differential diagnosis.
Fascin expression was investigated through the immunohistochemistry of
paraffin-embedded tissue in 79 cases of uterine smooth muscle tumor including 22 
usual leiomyoma, 31 LV, 4 STUMP, and 22 LMS cases. The cases were scored on the
basis of staining extent (from 0 to 4) and intensity (from 1 to 3), and were
assigned a combined score. Fascin expression was present in 20 of 22 (90.9%) LMS,
2 of 4 (50%) STUMP, 1 of 31 (3.2%) LV, and 1 of 22 (4.5%) usual leiomyoma cases. 
There was a statistically significant difference in fascin extent and intensity
between the LMS and benign groups, but no difference between the LMS and STUMP
groups. The results of this study indicate that more distinct fascin expression
exists in LMS than in the benign groups. Fascin can serve as a reliable
immunohistochemical marker in distinguishing uterine LMS from LVs and usual
leiomyoma, and it may usefully be used with histologic criteria in diagnosing
problematic cases.

SUMMARY: Polyps are the most common benign lesions in the endometrium. Metastasis
to the endometrial polyp from a distant primary tumor is rare. Breast carcinoma
is the most frequent extragenital cancer that metastasizes to the endometrial
polyp. We report the case of a 63-year-old with metastatic gall bladder
adenocarcinoma involving endometrial polyps detected by endometrial curetting. It
was the first sign of her metastatic disease. After this diagnosis, bone
metastases were detected during radiologic screening. Gastrointestinal tumor
metastasis to an endometrial polyp is a very rare event, but if a patient with a 
known primary extragenital tumor has abnormal vaginal bleeding, the possibility
of metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis.

SUMMARY: Malignant transformation of a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary is
rare, and occurs in approximately 2% of all cases. The most common malignancy
arising in mature cystic teratoma is squamous cell carcinoma. Sarcomas very
rarely develop in mature cystic teratoma. We describe the case of a 65-year-old
patient with mature cystic teratoma, and with rhabdomyosarcomatous transformation
and contralateral serous carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a
pure rhabdomyosarcoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma. The clinicopathologic 
and immunohistochemical findings of this exceptional case are reported and the
literature is reviewed.

Adnexal tumors with follicular differentiation in the breast parenchyma are
rarely encountered. The authors present a unique case arising in a 64-year-old
woman, in whom they observed composite differentiation toward follicular
germinative cells of the hair follicle with focal areas of outer root sheath
differentiation and pilar-type keratinization. The histogenesis of this tumor is 
analyzed in light of the peculiar pathological, immunohistochemical, and
molecular genetic findings.

Understanding migration, population and differentiation of primordial neural
crest cells will help in evolving biology of neuroblastoma. P16 is a tumour
suppressor gene contributing in cell cycle arrest as cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitor. Methylation is an important mechanism for silencing tumor suppressor
genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of p16 and its methylation 
pattern in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. This study included 23 cases (11 male; 12
female) and 31 samples from archival paraffin embedded tissues. P16 was studied
in 5 samples of normal adrenal medullar tissue, 5 samples of adrenal tissue
including blastic rests, 5 samples of neuroblastoma in situ tissue and in 8
samples of neuroblastoma tissues primary and after chemotherapy in each group.
The adrenal gland tissues were obtained from paediatric autopsy cases. Expression
of p16 was searched by immunohistochemistry. Methylation specific PCR was used to
detect the methylation rate of p16. The age range of autopsy cases was between 20
weeks of foetal age and 36 months of infant age. The mean age of neuroblastoma
cases was 45 months. P16 expression was positive in normal adrenal tissues, in
one of 5 samples of adrenal blastic rest tissue and in all of samples of after
chemotherapy; while no expression was observed in neuroblastoma and neuroblastoma
in situ tissues. P16 methylation was observed in samples of neuroblastoma in situ
and primary neuroblastoma tissues. Our results suggest that p16 and its
methylation seems to play role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and in the
migration, population and differentiation of primordial neural crest cells.
Inhibitors of DNA methylation may provide a useful tool for restoring p16
activity in neuroblastoma treatment.

Because forensic medicine workers have a greater occupational risk for infectious
diseases, strict rules and measures against infections must be implemented at
every stage of forensic medicine practices. In this study, we aim to evaluate the
infection control implementations in forensic medicine practices in Turkey.A
questionnaire survey was mailed to forensic medicine specialists and residents
between April and June 2005. The questionnaire consisted of 36 questions whose
designed was based on standard precautions and protective barriers against
infectious risks.In all, 111 doctors from 27 different cities responded to the
questionnaire. Of those doctors who responded, 43.2% reported performing external
examination anywhere. The percentage of doctors performing external examinations 
who regularly wore gloves, masks, and gowns, and washed hands with a disinfectant
were 81.5%, 24.7%, 30.9%, and 81.5%, respectively. The percentage of doctors
performing autopsies who regularly wore masks, protective eye-wear, gloves,
special gloves, and special boots were 59.6%, 10.6%, 98.9%, 71.3%, and 36.2%,
respectively. Only 2 negative pressure rooms were reported.According to these
results, precautionary measures against infectious risks in forensic medicine
practice in our country are insufficient. Conditions to facilitate and to improve
the compliance with infection control procedures must be prepared.

Konya, Turkey. sdemirci@selcuk.edu.tr

This article presents 16 complex suicide cases. Complex suicide is defined as the
use of more than one method to induce death. Of the victims, 10 were men and the 
ages ranged from 19 to 70 years. Eight victims left a suicide note. It was
observed that 13 victims realized the suicidal act in the house and 5 victims had
previous suicidal attempts. It was determined that 10 victims had psychiatric
disorders, one of them had alcohol dependence. Six victims were housewives, 4
victims were unemployed, followed by one each victim of student, worker, farmer, 
tradesman, prayer leader, and animal husbandry lines of business. Ten victims
were married; 3 victims were single; and 3 victims were divorced. On
investigating the methods of suicide, it was seen that 9 victims preferred sharp 
instrument usage; 5 victims insecticide ingestion; 4 victims each firearms,
medicine overdose; 3 victims each hanging, falling from a height; 2 victims
self-strangulation; and 1 victim each drowning, liquefied petroleum gas and
natural gas inhalation together, fungicide ingestion, rodenticide ingestion. It
was determined that 2 victims used 3 methods and the other 14 victims 2 methods
in company, to realize the suicide. In this article, the data obtained from our
study was discussed by comparing similar data.

Percutaneous laser ablation (PLA) is a new method to be used for reducing the
volume of symptomatic cold benign thyroid nodules. We aimed to introduce the
long-term histopathological effects of PLA procedure in thyroid nodules. A
42-year-old male patient with 18.7-mL nodule volume was transferred a total of
720 J of energy with 3-W power. A 50-year-old female patient with 14.1-mL volume 
nodule was transferred a total of 3,300 J with 5-W power. A 61-year-old female
patient with 49.7-mL volume nodule was transferred a total of 4,200 J with 5-W
power. The thyroidectomy materials were examined histopathologically 2 years
later. In histopathologic examination, it was observed that the periphery of
ablated area was organized with hyalinized connective tissue and the center was
organized with necrosis and carbon particles. Concurrently, in the center, we
detected calcifications and colloid and foreign-body giant cells against colloid 
in one patient. We did not encounter any pathologic findings in the tissue
adjacent to ablated area. In the cold benign thyroid nodules taken out by
thyroidectomy 2 years after PLA procedure, necrosis and hyalinization were
detected histopathologically. PLA procedure in cold benign thyroid nodules seems 
to be safe according to long-term histopathological findings.

The present study is aimed at determining the effect of parenteral octreotide
against oxidative damage caused by intra-tracheal bleomycin (BLM) administration.
A total of 30 male Wistar rats randomly divided into three groups (control,
bleomycin alone, and bleomycin and octreotide) were used in the study. A group of
animals received a single dose of intra-tracheal bleomycin (7.5mg/kg). Animals in
another group, which also received intra-tracheal bleomycin, were given 82.5
microg/kg octreotide via i.m. injection for a week. Animals in the control group 
received neither bleomycin nor octreotide. All animals were sacrificed at the end
of the experiment. Serum levels of malondialdehyde, vitamins A, E, and C,
selenium levels were determined. In addition, glutathion peroxidase activity
levels in erythrocytes were also determined. Malondialdehyde levels and
glutathion peroxidase activity were increased whereas antioxidant vitamin levels 
were decreased significantly in animals that received only bleomycin compared to 
control animals (p<0.05). The values in rats that received bleomycin and
octreotide were found to be closer to the control group (p<0.05). Selenium levels
in animals that received only bleomycin were determined to be reduced compared to
controls (p<0.05). On the other hand, selenium levels in bleomycin and octreotide
groups were similar to control values in (p<0.05). In conclusion, bleomycin
induces a severe stress and more importantly increases the amount of free
radicals whereas octreotide administration reduces this oxidative damage
significantly.

A case of juxtaglomerular cell tumor with novel histologic features.

Onder S(1), Baydar DE.

Author information:

Juxtaglomerular cell tumors constitute a very small group among the renal
neoplasms. Most secrete renin, causing hypertension and hypokalemia due to
secondary hyperaldosteronism. They have characteristic pathological features. For
the accurate evaluation, diagnosis has to be confirmed by immunohistochemical
staining for renin or electron microscopic demonstration of renin protogranules. 
This report presents a case of renal juxtaglomerular cell tumor in a 63-year-old 
man with previously unreported histological findings in addition to classic
morphology.

The aim of this study was focused on investigating the possible protective effect
of NS against GS-induced nephrotoxicity. Twenty four Wistar-albino rats were
divided into four equal groups as follows: control group, GS group (100mg/kg
intraperitoneal - i.p.), NSL+GS group (0.2 ml/kg+100mg/kg i.p.) and NSH+GS group 
(0.4 ml/kg+100mg/kg i.p.). Plasma creatinine and urea levels significantly
increased as a result of nephrotoxicity in the GS group. Also, creatinine and
urea levels significantly decreased in NSL+GS and NSH+GS groups. In the GS group,
plasma MDA and NO levels increased significantly (p<0.05) and erythrocyte SOD and
GSH-Px activities decreased significantly (p<0.05) when compared with control
group. NS administration with GS injection resulted in significantly decreased
MDA and NO generation and increased SOD and GSH-Px activities when compared with 
GS group. Proximal tubular necrosis, vacuolation, desquamation and degeneration
in epithelial cells of the proximal tubules, hyaline casts in tubular lumen,
mononuclear cell infiltration, glomerular and basement membrane alterations were 
histopathologically detected in the kidneys of the GS group. Co-treatments with
NS (low and high dose) considerably decreased the renal damage when compared with
the GS group. In conclusion, NS acts in the kidney as a potent scavenger of free 
radicals to prevent the toxic effects of GS both in the biochemical and
histopathological parameters.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) material from 20
cases of histologically verified medullary carcinoma (MC) of the breast and
correlate the cytomorphologic features with histologic appearance to improve the 
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of FNAC.
STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the cytologic features of 20 cases of MC of the breast 
in the archives of Ege University Hospital between 1994 and 2006.
RESULTS: Twenty patients with an aspirate and confirmed diagnosis of MC were
identified. Patient age was 30-74 years (mean, 48). The initial cytologic
diagnoses were positive for cancer in 17 cases, atypical/suspicious for cancer in
2 cases and negative for cancer in 1 case. The cytologic picture was
characterized by cellular smears composed of highly atypical epithelial tumor
cells in loosely cohesive sheets and lying singly, admixed with polymorphous
lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. Tumor cells had predominantly abundant
finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderate to marked nuclear
pleomorphism with prominent nudcleoli. Histologic examination confirmed that 11
cases were atypical MC and 9 were pure MC.
CONCLUSION: Breast MC is a rare, distinct category that appears to have rather
characteristic cellular features. Familiarity with the cell components is a
prerequisite in cytologic accuracy.

TLE1 expression is not specific for synovial sarcoma: a whole section study of
163 soft tissue and bone neoplasms.

Kosemehmetoglu K(1), Vrana JA, Folpe AL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara,
Turkey.

TLE1, a transcriptional repressor essential in hematopoiesis, neuronal
differentiation and terminal epithelial differentiation, has recently been shown 
in a single tissue microarray study to be a highly sensitive and relatively
specific marker of synovial sarcomas. Expression of TLE1 has not, however, been
studied in standard sections of soft tissue and bone tumors. We investigated TLE1
expression in a large series of well-characterized mesenchymal tumors, to more
fully characterize the range of TLE1 expression. Standard sections of 163 bone
and soft tissue tumors were immunostained for TLE1 (sc-9121, 1:100; Santa Cruz
Biochemicals) using the Dako Dual Envision+ detection system. Nuclear positivity 
was scored as negative (<5% of cell positive), 1+ (5-25% of cells positive), 2+
(25-50% of cells positive), and 3+ (>50% of cells positive). Overall, TLE1 was
expressed by 18 of 20 (90%) of synovial sarcoma, with 16 cases (89%) showing 2-3+
positivity. However, TLE1 expression was also seen in 53 of 143 (37%)
non-synovial sarcoma, with 36 such cases (25%) showing 2-3+ positivity. TLE1
expression was commonly seen in peripheral nerve sheath tumors, including 33% of 
neurofibromas, 100% of schwannomas, and 30% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumors. Among non-neoplastic tissues, nuclear TLE1 expression was variably
present in basal keratinocytes, adipocytes, perineurial cells, endothelial cells 
and mesothelial cells. Our study confirms the excellent sensitivity of TLE1 for
synovial sarcoma. However, TLE1 expression is by no means specific for synovial
sarcoma, being present in a number of tumors, which enter its differential
diagnosis, in particular tumors of peripheral nerve sheath origin. Heterogeneity 
of TLE1 expression likely explains the differences between the present standard
section study and the earlier TMA study. TLE1 may be of value in the differential
diagnosis of synovial sarcoma, but should be used only in the context of a panel 
of antibodies. Morphology, ancillary immunohistochemistry for traditional markers
such as cytokeratins and CD34, and molecular confirmation of synovial
sarcoma-associated fusion genes should remain the 'gold standards' for this
diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the microvascular architectural
complexity in oncocytomas and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (ChRCCs) by
fractal box-counting on CD34-labeled slides. The study group consisted of 23
cases (12 oncocytomas and 11 ChRCCs) diagnosed from resections. Capillaries were 
highlighted by CD34, and digital images from randomly selected, non-overlapping
areas were taken. Fractal dimensions of microvasculature were measured according 
to the "box-counting" method with the aid of image analysis software. Mean
fractal dimensions (MFDs) were calculated and compared. Hierarchical cluster
analysis was also performed to determine whether natural grouping occurs among
the cases. Cluster analysis revealed that the cases tended to aggregate in two
partially overlapping groups in which oncocytomas (8/12) and ChRCCs (7/11)
predominate, respectively. A slight but statistically important difference was
also revealed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Fractal dimension, a variable for
measuring the geometrical complexity of highly irregular objects, is used for
research in pathology. Although the number of cases is limited in our series, the
results indicate an obscure but quantitatively measurable difference, which
cannot be assessed by the naked eye. Similar studies investigating larger series 
are needed before a final conclusion can be made.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is subdivided as mass-forming,
periductal-infiltrating, and intraductal-growing types. Intraductal-growing type 
is an entity described in recent years as mucin-producing intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma or intrahepatic (biliary) intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasia (b-IPMN). b-IPMN is classified as adenoma, borderline tumor, carcinoma 
in situ, and carcinoma, from benign to malignant. Using a different
classification, b-IPMNs are subdivided into intestinal, pancreatobiliary,
gastric, or oncocytic based on morphology of the cells forming the lesion and
expression of MUC1, MUC2, and MUC5 gene proteins in the mucin family. The
clinical and histopathological features of b-IPMN diagnosed in three cases are
presented herein. Case 1 was classified as borderline. Case 2 was diagnosed as
carcinoma in situ. Case 3 had large invasive areas, and was diagnosed as
carcinoma. In all three cases, immunohistochemical investigation revealed MUC1
and MUC5AC to be positive, and MUC2 to be negative. We present herein three cases
diagnosed with the clinical and pathological findings of a new entity in the
literature, b-IPMN, and we discuss the macroscopic, histological, and
immunohistochemical features.

An in vivo assessment for the protective effects of silymarin for pyridine
toxicity was investigated through cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A1 and inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity prevention. Moreover, the effect of
pyridine-induced oxidative stress on metallothionein I-II (MT), a scavenger of
oxygen-derived free radicals, was investigated. Forty Syrian hamsters were
allocated into 4 groups. Syrian hamsters were dosed with pyridine (400mg/kg)
intraperitoneally with and without silymarin (200mg/kg daily by gavage) for 4
days. Pyridine induced diffuse degeneration and necrosis of the proximal and
distal renal tubular cells; cloudy swelling, necrosis and hepatocellular atypia
of the liver; and degenerative changes in the myocardium. The degree of
pathological alterations was less severe with simultaneous silymarin application.
CYP1A1, iNOS and MT expression levels were elevated in liver, kidney and heart in
response to acute pyridine toxicity. Silymarin application abolished or
significantly suppressed the induction of CYP1A1, iNOS and MT expressions in
liver, kidney and heart of the pyridine-treated Syrian hamsters. Enhanced
synthesis of MT by pyridine possibly implies a purposive cellular response to
prevent damage caused by oxygen radicals. However, silymarin significantly
reduced the oxidative-stress-inducing effect of pyridine as reflected by
decreased synthesis of MT. These results suggest that through oxidant generation,
pyridine may cause alteration of the metabolic ways, including nitric
oxide-mediated CYP1A1 activity.

Changes in the brain cortex of rabbits on a cholesterol-rich diet following
supplementation with a herbal extract of Tribulus terrestris.

Extracts of the medicinal herb Tribulus terrestris (TT) are used for treating
various diseases. The saponins, a component of TT, play a role in regulating
blood pressure and in treatment of hyperlipidemia. The aim of the study was to
investigate the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural alterations in the
cerebral cortex of experimental rabbits on a cholesterol rich diet treated with
TT. The rabbits were divided into three groups and followed for 12 weeks as
control group (CG); experimental group I (EG-I), fed with a cholesterol-rich
diet; experimental group II (EG-II), treated with an extract of TT (5 mg/kg/day) 
after a cholesterol-rich diet of 4 weeks. In EG-I there were ultrastructural
changes, including mitochondrial degeneration, increased lipofuscin pigments,
myelin sheath damage with axoplasmic shrinkage and electron dense granules in the
neurovascular unit. The number of synapses apparently decreased in both
experimental groups. Administration of TT extract in EG-II led to marked
ultrastructural alterations in neurons, including decreased mitochondrial
degeneration (P<0.001) and extensive oedematous areas in the neurovascular unit. 
However, in EG-II, lamellar myelin, axonal structures and mitochondria were well 
protected. These alterations possibly indicate that saponins have an effect on
the neurons either directly or by its conversion to steroidal saponins.
Therefore, these findings add further evidence supporting the protective claims
of TT in cerebral architecture in dietary induced hyperlipidemia.

Mucositis is an important dose-limiting side effect of methotrexate for which
there is no definitive prophylaxis or treatment. This study was designed to
investigate whether proanthocyanidin had a protective effect on
methotrexate-induced small intestine damage. Twenty-eight albino rats were
randomized into four groups. To the first group, methotrexate was applied as a
single dose (20mg/kg) intraperitoneally. To the second group, proanthocyanidin
(100mg/kg) was given orally every day by gavage in addition to methotrexate
application until the rats were killed. To the third group, only proanthocyanidin
was administered. The fourth group was the control. All animals were sacrificed 4
days after the intraperitoneal injection of methotrexate for histopathological
examination and the assay for tissue malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and
glutathione peroxidase levels. Methotrexate caused jejunal injury and increased
malondialdehyde levels. Administration of proanthocyanidin decreased the jejunal 
damage and malondialdehyde level, which were caused by methotrexate treatment and
increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels. These results
suggest that proanthocyanidin may protect the small intestine of rats from
methotrexate-induced damage. The effects of proanthocyanidin could result from
its antioxidant properties.

OBJECTIVE: To date, there is no effective treatment of contrast medium
(CM)-induced nephropathy. Multiple studies documented a protective role of
hydration and N-acetylcystein (NAC) as prophylactic agents against CM-induced
nephropathy in a high-risk population. In the present study, we investigated a
new antioxidant agent, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), and compare with NAC 
against contrast nephropathy.
METHODS: Forty-two adult male rats were divided into six experimental groups,
which were control, injected with intravenous (i.v.) CM, injected with i.p. CAPE,
injected with i.p. NAC, injected with i.v. CM pretreated with i.p. CAPE, injected
with i.v. CM pretreated with i.p. NAC. CAPE and NAC were given daily throughout
the study. All rats were deprived of water for 24h at the third day of the study 
and then contrast medium was administered to CM, CAPECM and NACCM groups. The
rats were sacrificed at the fifth day. Oxidant-antioxidant status was determined 
in renal tissues. The severity of injury was scored with a light microscope in
renal tissue. Plasma creatinine levels were measured.
RESULTS: Renal injury scores were higher in CAPECM and NACCM groups than in
control, CAPE and NAC groups, but lower than the CM group. Likewise, creatinine
levels of CAPECM and NACCM groups were higher than the control groups but they
were significantly lower than the level of the CM group. Creatinine levels of the
NACCM group were significantly higher than the CAPECM group. Malondialdehyde
levels were significantly lower in CAPECM and NACCM groups than the CM group.
CONCLUSION: CAPE might protect renal structure and functions as well as NAC
against CM injury.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of dental and
periodontal treatments to the course of oral ulcers in patients with Behcet's
disease (BD).
METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive BD patients with oral ulcers were studied.
Twenty-nine patients were in the intervention group (F/M: 15/14, mean age: 39.6
+/- 6.9 years) and 29 (F/M: 15/14, 39.4 +/- 10.6 years) were followed with a
conventional treatment approach. In addition to oral hygiene education, dental
and periodontal treatments were carried out in the intervention group, whereas
the control group was only given oral hygiene education. Patients were evaluated 
in the pre-treatment observation period (1 month), treatment period (1 month) and
6 months after treatment.
RESULTS: An increase in the number of new oral ulcers (4.1 +/- 3.5) was observed 
within 2 days during the treatment compared with 3-30 days during treatment month
(2.3 +/- 1.2) (P = 0.002). However, 6 months after the treatment, the number of
oral ulcers (1.9 +/- 1.5) was significantly lower compared with the pre-treatment
observation (4.8 +/- 3.2) (P = 0.000) and treatment periods (6.4 +/- 2.3) in the 
intervention group (P = 0.05), whereas a similar oral ulcer presence was observed
in the control group (2.8 +/- 2.4, 3.7 +/- 2.3 and 4.8 +/- 4.3, respectively) (P 
> 0.05). Dental and periodontal indices were also better in the intervention
group during the 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, in BD patients, dental and periodontal
therapies could be associated with a flare-up of oral ulcers in the short term,
but may decrease their number in longer follow-up. They also lead to a better
oral health.

Screening properties of human papillomavirus testing for predicting cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion smears: a prospective study.

Obstetrics, Istanbul, Turkey. cemdane@yahoo.com

The aim of the present study was to determine the usefulness of human
papillomavirus (HPV) testing for predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN) 1 and 2 to 3 on cervical biopsies in women who had atypical squamous cells 
of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion (LSIL) on Papanicolaou tests. In this prospective cohort, 167 women with
abnormal cytologic examination (ASCUS and LSIL) were evaluated by
colposcopy-directed biopsy and endocervical curettage. Colposcopy was performed
on all study participants to obtain cervical tissue for histologic examination
for detection of underlying CIN in patients with an initial cytologic test result
of ASCUS and LSIL. A sample for HPV DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction
was obtained. The HPV type 16 was positive in 35.4% of the 167 women with
abnormal cytologic examination result in our gynecologic outpatient's clinic.
Histologic diagnosis of CIN 1 was found in 45 of 135 women with ASCUS and in 17
of 32 women with LSIL. According to the cytologic findings, the frequency of CIN 
grade 2 or 3 in patients classified as ASCUS and LSIL was 12.5% (17/135) and
18.7% (6/32), respectively. Of the ASCUS smears, 9.6% were positive for HPV type 
16. The sensitivity of the HPV type 16 using polymerase chain reaction technique 
threshold in detecting CIN 1 and CIN 2 to 3 was 57% and 46% in ASCUS-LSIL
cytologic examination, respectively. The positive predictive value of HPV type 16
ranged from 60% in patients with CIN 1 and 42% in CIN 2 to 3 in ASCUS-LSIL. By
contrast, negative predictive value was 58% in patients with CIN 1 and 80% in CIN
2 to 3. The low positive predictive value of HPV testing with ASCUS smears
suggests that HPV positivity could be not used for predicting the presence of CIN
2 to 3.

Ectopic growth hormone-releasing hormone secretion by a neuroendocrine tumor
causing acromegaly: long-term follow-up results.

Ectopic secretion of growth hormone-releasing-hormone (GHRH) is a rare cause of
acromegaly-representing less than 1% of patients. A 25-year-old woman was
admitted to the hospital with acromegaly and a 6 x 6 cm infrahepatic mass. Sellar
magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse pituitary enlargement consistent
with hyperplasia. The infrahepatic mass was resected, and the histopathological
diagnosis was a well-differentiated invasive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
duodenum with metastases to local lymph nodes. The tumor cells contained
cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for GHRH. Because increased IGF-1 concentrations
persisted after the operation, the patient was treated with octreotide
long-acting repeatable (LAR) injections of 20 mg/month. Growth hormone and IGF-1 
levels normalized. After 6 years of surveillance, a left paraaortic mass was
detected by uptake of indium 111 octreotide. Surgical exploration revealed
metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma in a 2.5-cm lymph node. Postoperatively, the 
IGF-1 concentration was mildly elevated. Octreotide LAR therapy is being
continued at 10 mg/month. This case suggests that octreotide treatment may have a
beneficial effect on disease course and can be maintained for as long as 7 years 
in a patient with acromegaly due to a GHRH-secreting neuroendocrine carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare oral health-related
quality of life (oral QoL) in patients from UK and Turkey with Behcet's disease
(BD).
METHODS: Thirty-one BD patients from UK (F/M: 18/13, mean age: 41.8 +/- 11.5
years) and Turkey (F/M: 18/13, mean age: 41.5 +/- 10.3) who were matched
according to age and gender were included in the study. All patients had active
oral ulcers. Oral QoL was assessed by Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14).
Oral health was evaluated by dental and periodontal indices.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in OHIP-14 scores between patients
from UK (22.7 +/- 14.4) and Turkey (20.4 +/- 14.3) (P = 0.709). The OHIP-14 score
correlated with the healing time of oral ulcers in UK (r = 0.4, P = 0.04) and the
number of oral ulcers in Turkey (r = 0.4, P = 0.012). The number of oral ulcers
per month was significantly higher in UK (3.3 +/- 2.8) compared with that in
Turkey (1.5 +/- 2.5) (P = 0.014). However, the number of filled teeth and
frequency of tooth brushing were significantly lower in patients from Turkey
compared with those in UK (P = 0.000). Similarly, the duration since the last
dental visit (5.1 +/- 7.2 months) was significantly lower in UK compared with
that in Turkey (28.6 +/- 23.7 months) (P = 0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Oral QoL was similar in patients from UK and Turkey with active oral
ulcers. However, the number of oral ulcers was observed to be higher in UK. As
expected, a lower utilization rate of dental services might have led to a poorer 
oral health in patients from Turkey.

Effect of vitamin C in reducing the toxicity of endosulfan in liver in rabbits.

Mor F(1), Ozmen O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
University of Mehmet Akif Ersoy, 15100 Burdur, Turkey.

In this study, the effect of endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide, and the
ameliorating effect of vitamin C on the livers of New Zealand white rabbits were 
studied. Livers of the rabbits were examined grossly and histopathologically, and
caspase-3 activity was detected by immunohistochemical methods. A total of
twenty-four rabbits were divided into four groups (n=6). Rabbits in Group I (END)
were daily given a sublethal dose of endosulfan (1mg/kgbw) in corn oil by oral
gavage for 6 weeks. Group II (END+C) received the same dose of endosulfan and
additionally Vit C (20mg/kgbw) every other day during this period. Group III
(OIL+C) received corn oil daily by oral gavage and vitamin C every other day for 
6 weeks. Group IV (OIL), the control group, received only corn oil daily, by oral
gavage throughout the experiment. The concentration of alpha-endosulfan in the
END group was higher in livers (0.102+/-0.012ppb) than the beta-endosulfan
(0.072+/-0.001ppb). Decreased accumulation of alpha and beta endosulfan was
observed in the END+C group (0.025+/-0.003 and 0.016+/-0.002ppb, respectively)
(p<0.0001). The most prominent gross findings at the necropsy were seen in the
END group, in which swollen and pale livers were commonly observed. Hemorrhages, 
degenerations, necrosis, and in some rabbits bile duct hyperplasia were the
marked histopathological findings of the END group. Caspase-3 positive reaction
was more severe in this group than in the others. An ameliorating effect of Vit C
on gross, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings was observed in the 
END+C group. The results revealed that endosulfan is highly toxic for rabbit
livers. However, toxicity was decreased by Vit C treatment, which reduced the
accumulation of endosulfan in livers four-fold.

Signet ring cells in fine needle aspiration cytology of breast carcinomas: review
of the cytological findings in ten cases identified by histology.

Author information:

Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To establish whether the presence of signet ring cells (SRCs) in
histology sections of breast carcinoma cases was reflected by their presence in
fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears, correlating to the histological
type of breast carcinoma.
METHODS: We reviewed the FNAC findings of ten cases that had been diagnosed as
primary breast carcinoma with SRCs on histological sections between 1998 and
2007. Slides and histological sections were obtained from the archives of Ege
University Hospital.
RESULTS: FNA smears were reviewed for the following cytomorphological features:
background, cellularity, architecture, nuclear pleomorphism and the presence of
SRCs. The background was bloody in eight cases, necrotic in one, and clean in
one. There was no mucinous material in any of the cases. Cellularity was
prominent in five cases (hypercellular), moderate in three (cellular) and low in 
two (hypocellular). Loosely cohesive groups of tumour cells of varying size were 
observed in all cases. A plasmacytoid appearance to some of the tumour cells was 
seen in all cases and discohesive tumour cells were present in eight. Nuclear
pleomorphism was high in six cases and moderate in four. SRCs were observed in
seven of the ten cases. Two of these seven cases also had a tubular pattern and
one had tumour giant cells.
CONCLUSIONS: FNAC should be evaluated carefully regarding the presence of SRCs
when cells with a plasmacytoid appearance are observed in either hyper- or
hypocellular smears. The presence of single SRCs in FNACs with hypercellularity, 
high nuclear grade and tubular formation or tumour giant cells may be a clue in
favour of ductal carcinoma. The presence of single SRCs in FNACs with
hypocellularity and mild to moderate nuclear grade may be suggestive of lobular
carcinoma. However, larger studies would be needed to establish the predictive
value of the presence of SRCs on FNAC.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) ameliorates cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity 
in rabbit.

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the protective effect of caffeic acid 
phenethyl ester (CAPE) on cisplatin hepatotoxicity. Thirty New Zealand rabbits
were divided into 5 groups as group 1 (saline-injected control, C), group 2 (1%
ethanol; vehicle for CAPE, E), group 3 (CAPE), group 4 (cisplatin, CS) and group 
5 (cisplatin plus CAPE, CS+CAPE). Cisplatin caused increased immunoreactivity
against inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but CAPE treatment reduced the
immunoreactive hepatocytes. Liver malondialdehide (MDA), nitric oxide (NO(.))
levels and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities were higher in CS than in groups C
and E. Cisplatin treatment also significantly decreased the tissue reduced
glutathione (GSH) concentration compared to groups C and E. CAPE administration
normalized the tissue GSH level and XO activity in group CS+CAPE, whereas CAPE
treatment did not affect MDA level in group CS+CAPE. In addition, CAPE treatment 
significantly depressed the cisplatin-induced NO(.) increase in group CS+CAPE.
Histopathologically, cisplatin caused hydropic degenerations, necrosis in
hepatocytes, sinusoidal congestion, Kupffer cell proliferation and mononuclear
cell infiltration. These alterations were less severe in rabbits receiving
CS+CAPE. Parallel to histopathology, cisplatin increased serum AST and ALT
levels, whereas CAPE treatment significantly reduced cisplatin-induced AST and
ALT rise in the serum. Results suggest that cisplatin causes oxidative and
nitrosative damage to hepatocytes. Cisplatin-induced increase in XO and NO(.)
could contribute oxidative stress in the hepatotoxicity. CAPE shows partial
protection against cisplatin-associated biochemical and histopathological
alterations.

Eosinophils are associated with various disorders, such as allergic or
hypersensitivity reactions, parasitic diseases, connective tissue diseases,
certain neoplastic diseases (Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas, and carcinomas), and
various immune deficiency states. Eosinophils can infiltrate any tissue and can
cause tissue damage. Heart, has been demonstrated to be the most extensively
involved and toxicity of eosinophils is well-established on cardiac tissue. We
describe 3 cases with extensive eosinophilic infiltration without endomyocardial 
fibrosis. All patients died after a short clinical course with rapidly
progressive heart failure. Bronchial asthma, hydatid disease and drug reaction
were considered as possible etiologies of eosinophilia in case 1 and case 2. Case
3 was considered to fall into the "idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome" in
which no underlying causes for eosinophilia could be identified.

Hydatid cyst is a parasite disease, which is common in those countries where
animal husbandry is extensive, but preventive medicine is lacking. Endemic
regions are South Europe, South America, Africa, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, 
and India. In the study, a sudden death case due to cardiac hydatid cyst rupture 
located in right ventricle has been presented with a review of the literature.
The victim was a 10-year-old girl of a family who raised sheep. External
examination of the body showed congestion in both the head and face but neither
trauma nor evidence of violence or eruptions on the skin were found. At autopsy, 
through a vertical incision on the frontal surface of truncus pulmonalis, a total
of 8 daughter cysts were obtained. A 6 x 5 cm cyst was observed in the right
ventricular apex. In those countries where hydatid cyst is endemic, and when
sudden unexpected death occurs in individuals involved in animal husbandry,
cardiac hydatid cyst must be kept in mind as a cause.

In the Islamic context, "fitrah" refers to humanity's innate disposition toward
virtue and the ability to differentiate between right and wrong. A common quote
regarding fitrah, from the Prophet is "The fitrah consists of 5 things:
circumcision, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, plucking the armpit
hairs, and shaving the pubic hairs."In this study, our aim was to determine the
status of axillary and pubic shaving in medicolegal death cases that took place
in the Konya Province of Turkey and to evaluate the relationship with the origin 
of suicide. Of 2850 medicolegal death cases, 206 (7.2%) were of suicidal origin. 
It was observed that the average age in the cases of suicidal origin was 36.76
+/- 17.72 years, and 146 of 206 cases (70.9%) were men. As a method of suicide,
hanging was the chosen method in 100 cases (48.5%), whereas firearm injuries
occurred in 54 cases (26.2%), and intoxication was involved in 37 cases (18.0%). 
Daily axillary and pubic shaving was observed in 26 of 2644 (1.0%) death cases
that occurred with nonsuicidal reasons, but in 65 of 206 were (31.6%) suicidal
cases. Because suicidal notes were present in 25 (12.1%) of all of the suicidal
cases, the ratio of daily axillary and pubic shaving was significantly higher
than that of the suicidal notes.In investigating the cases of suicidal origin for
medicolegal purposes, evidence showing that this action was committed by the
victim, the presence of a suicide note at the death scene and, a history of a
previous suicidal attempt, it was thought that the presence of daily axillary and
pubic shaving on external examination of the victim's body, when of Muslim faith,
could also be considered a feature of suicide.

Cannabis stimulates dopamine release and activates dopaminergic reward neurons in
central pathways that lead to enhanced dependence. Catechol-O-methyl transferase 
(COMT) inactivates amplified extraneuronally released dopamine. A functional
polymorphism (COMT Val158Met) resulting in increased enzyme activity has been
associated with polysubstance abuse and addiction to heroin and methamphetamine. 
The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the COMT Val158Met 
polymorphism and use of cannabis. Fifty-five cannabis users and 75 normal
controls were enrolled in this study. Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping 
was used to evaluate the presence of COMT gene polymorphism. There was a
difference in genotype frequencies between cannabis users and controls, including
the distribution of the COMT genotypes (H/H, H/L) (P < 0.001) and alleles (H, L) 
(P < 0.01), when comparing the patient groups and the control individuals.
However, LL genotype distribution was similar between the groups. These results
suggest a significant association between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and
susceptibility to cannabis dependence.

A rare case of human herpes virus 8-unrelated primary effusion lymphoma-like
lymphoma: a report and review of the literature. APMIS 2009; 117:222-29. Primary 
effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a very rare type of lymphoma usually confined to the
body cavities predominantly in immunosuppressed patients infected with human
herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). The new term for HHV-8 independent PEL is HHV8-unrelated 
PEL-like lymphoma. We describe an 89-year-old human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-negative male patient with HHV8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma in the pleura. 
No hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was detected. Chest radiography and
computed tomography revealed right pleural effusion, but no evidence of tumor
mass or lymph node enlargement. Cytological analysis of the pleural effusion
revealed a high-grade lymphoma with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant
cytoplasm with immunophenotypes positive for CD45, CD30, CD38, CD7 and CD71.
Because of the advanced age, no chemotherapy was given. Effusion resolved
spontaneously. One year after the diagnosis, a new pleural effusion developed at 
the left side. Following thoracentesis and pleurodesis, the patient remained in
complete remission for 40 months. To date, 30 cases of HHV8-unrelated PEL-like
lymphoma/HIV negative have been reported in the literature. The outcome of the
HHV8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma patients who were HIV negative seems to be
better than HIV- and HHV-8-positive PEL.

Precautions taken to avoid abandoning the act of hanging and reducing pain in
suicidal hanging cases.

This study presents 17 cases of hanging with some preventative measures, when
compared with usual hanging fatalities, between 2002 and 2006 in the province of 
Konya, Turkey. We observed in 4 cases that the victim had only tied together
their hands, whereas in 1 case both the hands (with a clothesline) and mouth
(with a plastic bag) had been fastened. In a further case, the oral orifice had
been closed using a scarf and in the remaining 11 cases, soft materials such as a
scarf, hood, the collar of a coat or shirt had been used as padding against the
ligature loop. At first glance, the cases where the victim's hands and/or mouth
were found tied were thought to be homicides. However, an investigation of the
death scene, together with the autopsy findings and inquiry data, showed the
cause of death was from suicide. Thus, in suicidal hanging cases certain
precautions and preventative measures were observed. For example, tying the hands
together was regarded as a means to make self-release impossible; closure of the 
oral orifice as a means to prevent the victim from calling out for help, and
placing soft material against the ligature loop was thought to be an attempt to
lessen the feeling of pain.

Approximately 10% of all deaths in the world occur as a result of stroke.
Determination of the time schedule of the pathologic events in a stroke patient
is invaluable for a forensic specialist. The aim of this study was to define the 
schedule of the macroscopic and microscopic changes that occurred in a rat model 
of permanent focal ischemia for providing useful clues for the evaluation of
stroke patients. Male Wistar rats weighing 250 to 350 g were used in this study. 
Permanent focal brain ischemia was applied by the suture occlusion method. The
animals were divided into 7 experimental groups (n = 6) with time schedules
including 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 72 hours, and the sham. Brains were harvested at the
end of the determined time schedule. Lesions in the frontoparietal cortex were
evaluated macroscopically first and later hematoxylin eosin stained sections from
the infarct core were investigated microscopically. Macroscopically, enlargement 
of the ipsilateral hemisphere was mild at 6 hour, apparent at 12 and 24 hours,
and mild again at 72 hours. Microscopically, ischemic changes were apparent even 
at 1.5 hour. Red neurons and infiltration of the parenchyma with neutrophil
leukocytes were observed at 12 hours. Pannecrosis and massive leukocyte
infiltration were observed at 72 hours. Macroscopic and microscopic findings
obtained from a rat model may provide clues for determination of the
time-dependent changes due to brain ischemia in human subjects. Finally, the
benefits of determination of time course of pathologic changes in the brain for
forensic scientists were discussed.

Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) mediates the transport of glucose across the
cellular membrane. Its elevated levels and/or activation have been shown to be
associated with malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate GLUT-1
expression in pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas. Tissue microarray-based
samples of 178 neuroendocrine carcinomas, including 48 typical carcinoids, 31
atypical carcinoids, 27 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and 72 small cell
carcinomas from different patients, were studied immunohistochemically for GLUT-1
expression. Forty-seven percent (75/161) of pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas
were immunoreactive with GLUT-1. GLUT-1 was observed in 7% (3/46) of typical
carcinoid, 21% (6/29) of atypical carcinoid, 74% (17/23) of large cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma and 78% (49/63) of small cell carcinoma. GLUT-1
expression correlated with increasing patient age (P=0.01) and with
neuroendocrine differentiation/tumor type (P<0.001), but not with gender, tumor
size or stage. GLUT-1 expression was seen in a characteristic membranous pattern 
of staining along the luminal borders or adjacent to necrotic areas. GLUT-1
expression was associated with an increased risk of death for neuroendocrine
carcinomas as a group (risk ratio=2.519; 95% confidence interval=1.519-4.178;
P<0.001) and carcinoids (risk ratio=4.262; 95% confidence interval=1.472-12.343; 
P=0.01). In conclusion, GLUT-1 is expressed in approximately half of the
pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas and shows a strong correlation with
neuroendocrine differentiation/grade, but not with other clinicopathologic
variables. Further studies appear plausible to elucidate the prognostic
significance of GLUT-1 expression in pulmonary carcinoids.

RET finger protein (RFP), which belongs to the large B-box RING finger protein
family, has been reported to be expressed in breast carcinoma cell lines. We
conducted this study to evaluate the expression level of RFP in breast
carcinomas. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 133 cases of invasive breast
carcinoma. Sections obtained from tissue arrays and whole sections from 10
non-neoplastic breast tissues were stained for ER, PR, ErbB2, and RFP using
immunohistochemistry, and ErbB2 gene status was evaluated by FISH. The
correlation between various immunohistochemical markers was determined. We found 
nuclear RFP expression in 41.4% of invasive carcinomas and in none of the
non-neoplastic breast tissues. We also stained whole sections of 29 cases of
invasive breast carcinoma, which included the TMA study, and 10 cases of ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by RFP. We observed that four (40%) of the DCIS cases
were positive with RFP. In statistical analysis, there was a significant,
positive association between RFP and ErbB2 status at the protein level (p=0.002) 
and the gene level (p=0.049). There was no statistically significant association 
between the expression of RFP and tumor size, LN status, ER, PR, and grade
(p>0.05). However, we found a significant association between age and RFP
expression. RFP expression was stronger in patients 50 years or older (p=0.048). 
In our study, the expression of RFP correlated strongly with ErbB2 status. Our
study is the first in the literature to show expression of RFP in patients with
breast carcinoma. However, the possible role of RFP in breast carcinogenesis
needs to be investigated in more detailed clinical and experimental studies.

PAX-2 in the diagnosis of primary renal tumors: immunohistochemical comparison
with renal cell carcinoma marker antigen and kidney-specific cadherin.

Turkey.

The diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains problematic, especially in
the context of metastasis or small needle biopsy specimens. The renal cell
carcinoma marker (RCCM) and kidney-specific cadherin (KSC) are considered
specific markers for RCC but are expressed preferentially in specific subtypes of
RCC of lower grades. This study was aimed at evaluating the usefulness of PAX-2
in the diagnosis of renal tumors and comparing it with that of RCCM and KSC.
Immunostaining for PAX-2, RCCM, and KSC was performed on consecutive tissue
sections of 130 renal tumors. PAX-2 was successfully detected in routine tissue
specimens. Although PAX-2 seems to be more sensitive than RCCM and KSC, there is 
significant staining overlap in relation to histologic subtypes, justifying the
use of all 3 markers, which helps detect the vast majority of renal neoplasms.
PAX-2 seems to have a significant role in renal neogenesis and may represent a
novel therapeutic target.

Extranodal follicular dendritic cell sarcoma/tumours (FDCS/Ts) and
interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma/tumours (IDCS/Ts) are rare neoplasms. We
present two cases of FDCS/T and IDCS/T of the breast. The FDCS/T case (case 1)
presented in a 31-year-old woman and the IDCS/T case (case 2) in a 67-year-old
woman who both showed a firm lump in the left breast. The FDCS/T lesion
superficially appeared as an anaplastic carcinoma and the IDCS/T was reminiscent 
of a spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma. Nevertheless both lesions were negative 
for keratins while case 1 displayed neoplastic cells strongly positive for CD21, 
vimentin and focally for CD68 and S-100 protein. The tumour cells of case 2 were 
positive for S-100, CD68 and CD45. In breast, an unusual keratin negative tumour 
composed predominantly of spindle cells arranged in fascicles, storiform pattern 
or whorls with a lymphoid rich stroma should raise suspicion for FDCS/Ts or
IDCS/Ts. The distinction from malignant tumours with similar features is
discussed.

Comment in
    Int J Gynecol Pathol. 2010 Jul;29(4):341-2.

This study investigates the expression of cyclooxgenase (COX)-2 and matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in patients with adenomyosis or endometrial polyps and 
their possible relation to microvascular density in these lesions. The subjects
were 25 patients with adenomyosis, 30 patients with endometrial polyps, and 20
female controls. The expression of COX-2, MMP-2, and CD34 was studied
immunohistochemically. Microvesseldensity (MVD) was calculated by the counting of
CD34-positive vascular endothelial cells. The quantity and intensity of COX-2
expression in endometrium did not vary during the menstrual cycle in the control 
group and in patients with endometrial polyps. In patients with adenomyosis, it
was higher in the secretory phase. MMP-2 expression in stromal cells in
adenomyotic foci and endometrial polyps were higher than in normal endometrium.
In the proliferative phase, MVD in adenomyosis foci was higher than in normal
endometrium and endometrial polyps. In the secretory phase, MVD in adenomyotic
foci and endometrial polyps was higher than in normal endometrium. Overexpression
of stromal MMP-2 may play a role in the development of adenomyosis and
endometrial polyps. Aberrant COX-2 expression in eutopic endometrium during the
luteal phase may be associated with the pathogenesis of adenomyosis; however,
expression of COX-2 does not seem to play a role in the development of
endometrial polyps. MVD was high in both lesions, but there was no significant
correlation between MVD and the expression of MMP-2 or COX-2. Mechanisms other
than COX-2 and MMP-2 may contribute to the promotion of angiogenesis in these
lesions.

BACKGROUND: We planned this study to analyze probable associations between p53,
cyclinD1, Ki67 and histopathological features in basal cell carcinomas (BCC).
METHODS: Histological differentiation types, histological growth patterns and
tissue responses were analyzed in 50 cases of BCC. In immunohistochemical
analysis, p53, cyclinD1 and Ki67 antibodies were investigated. P53 expression was
evaluated based on a cut-off value of 25% positivity. CyclinD1 expression was
graded from 0 to 3+ according to the percentage of positive nuclear staining. The
percentage of positively staining cells for Ki67 was recorded.
RESULTS: The following significant correlations were detected. Solid infiltrative
type differentiation was related to the infiltrative histological growth pattern.
The rates of p53 positivity and severe fibrosis in the groups of mixed and
infiltrative growth patterns were higher than others. Besides, p53-positive cases
showed more severe fibrosis and had a higher mean value for Ki67 index. Epidermal
p53 and cyclinD1 clones in normal epidermal areas adjacent to tumors were noticed
in 42% and 52% of the cases, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: P53 expression seems to be related to Ki67 index and some
histopathological features of BCC, such as infiltrative histological growth
pattern and probably fibrosis.

A retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst mimicking adrenal tumour in an adult: is
differential diagnosis truly possible?

Bronchogenic cysts are developmental abnormalities of the primitive foregut
resulting from aberrant budding from the ventral diverticulum. A retroperitoneal 
position for a bronchial cyst is extremely unusual and should be differentiated
from other neoplastic lesions. Although histologically they can be differentiated
from other lesions, bronchial cysts may show various pathological patterns of
differentiation that may cause confusion in differentiating them from cystic
teratomas. This is a case of a retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst featuring
uncommon histological findings, which raises the question whether these benign
lesions can always be accurately differentiated from teratomatoid cystic
neoplasms.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the age- and gender-dependent effects 
of desflurane and sevoflurane on the liver.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Upon the approval of ethics committee, 84 rats were divided 
into four groups as 21 young male, 21 young female, 21 old male, and 21 old
female rats. Then, each group was further divided into three groups as
desflurane, sevoflurane, and control groups. Maintaining the minimum alveolar
concentration of 1, desflurane at 6vol% and sevoflurane at 2vol% in 6Lmin(-1)
100% O2 were administered for 2h in a transparent plastic container of
40cmx40cmx70cm. Each liver preparation was evaluated for hydropic degeneration,
nuclear polymorphism, portal neutrophile infiltration, portal lymphocyte
infiltration, and focal necrosis, and each preparation was assigned injury points
of 0-3; thus, the number of histopathologically injured cases, total injury
scores of each preparation, and the mean injury scores of each group were
determined.
RESULTS: Desflurane and sevoflurane did not significantly increase hepatic injury
in the young male rats, while both agents caused significantly more hepatic
injury in the young female rats. In the old rats, both desflurane and sevoflurane
inflicted more hepatic injury on both genders. In addition, desflurane caused
more hepatic injury in the old female rats than in the young female or the old
male rats.
CONCLUSION: Hepatic injury associated with desflurane and sevoflurane was mild to
moderate, suggesting that both agents can be safely used in routine anaesthesia
procedures.

Pulmonary myxoma is an uncommon neoplasm. A pale tan, lobulated, and
well-circumscribed mass was discovered at slaughter in the left lung of a
5-year-old sheep. Histologically, the tumor was composed of spindloid to stellate
cells in a myxoid matrix. Neoplastic cells were immunohistochemically positive
for vimentin but did not express cytokeratins, S-100 protein, smooth muscle
actin, desmin, or p53. On the basis of the histologic and immunohistochemical
findings, this tumor was diagnosed as a myxoma.

Nuclear planimetry on the samples from cytologically overlapping proliferative
breast lesions.

Differentiation of low-grade breast carcinomas from fibroadenomas with atypia on 
fine-needle aspiration cytology material may sometimes be problematic. In some
cytological samples of these lesions, both the nuclei of cells and patterns of
cell clusters display substantial overlapping morphological characteristics.
Nuclear morphometry on cytological material is suggested as an ancillary method
for the differential diagnosis in many lesions, including breast tumors.
Twenty-five cytological samples obtained from patients with breast lesions, which
were histopathologically confirmed as grade I ductal carcinomas (n=10), tubular
carcinomas (n=5), and fibroadenomas with atypia (n=10), were utilized in this
study. Eight geometric features of about 2002 nuclei from these tumors were
measured. Discriminant analysis was performed on this data set in order to test
the correct classification based on the eight measured variables. Statistical
analyses were carried out with two fundamentally different approaches: in the
first one, the entire data from all measured nuclei were used for classification.
In the second one, a subset of data representing the 10% most deviated values of 
variables was extracted from the entire dataset to simulate the "selective
examination" performed during classical morphologic evaluation. When the entire
data was used in discriminant analysis, the overall performance in the correct
classification rate was found to be approximately 50%, which was considered an
unacceptable value in routine diagnostic practice. In the subset of data
constructed with our systematic and reproducible "selection bias", the overall
performance of correct classification rate of the same discriminant model
improved substantially to 97%. Morphologic examination is actually based on
selection. The use of data obtained from all of the cells in morphometry, as
previously used in nearly all of the statistical methods, may cause a masking
effect in diagnostically important features. Morphometric studies may seem to be 
useless when this effect is not taken into account. However, with a systematic
and reproducible selection of the values with a proper "bias", morphometry may
provide some discriminatory information in overlapping lesions.

BACKGROUND: Genetic factors that predispose individuals to Behçet's disease (BD) 
are considered to play important roles in the development of the disease. The aim
of this study was to determine, by counting sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and
micronucleus (MN) frequencies, whether DNA damage have an effect on the
pathogenesis of BD. Furthermore, our aim was to show if there is an association
between oxidative stress and chromosome instability in BD.
METHODS: We analyzed lymphocytes from patients with BD (16 in active and 14 in
inactive periods) and 20 healthy controls for SCE and MN frequencies. In
addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) level,
glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) count were determined in the all subjects.
RESULTS: The SCE and MN frequencies were significantly higher in both the active 
and inactive period patients than in the controls (p < 0.00001, p < 0.0001, p <
0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), and the MDA level was significantly higher in
both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p < 0.01 and p
< 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly 
lower in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p <
0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased plasma MDA level and decreased
plasma GSH-Px and SOD levels reflect the increased levels of oxidative stress in 
BD patients, and this situation may impair genetic stability in BD patients.

PURPOSE: Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule that plays various roles in the body
tissues. NO plays important roles in vasodilatation, platelet aggregation,
cytokine stimulation, neurotransmission, immune function, etc. NO also exerts
dual functions as an oxidant and antioxidant substance depending on its
concentrations and environmental conditions. In this study, we aimed to examine
possible correlation between NO levels and NO synthase (NOS) activity in the
patients with oral cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 19 tissues from human subjects (11
malign and eight benign lesions).
RESULTS: NO level and NOS activity were found decreased in the malign lesions
compared with those of the benign ones.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, two suggestions can be made; first, decreased NO
synthesis may be an attempt to suppress angiogenesis, which is known to provide
more essential nutrients to malign lesions and/or second, malign lesions may
suppress NO production to be capable of creating more rapid proliferation as it
has been known that NO is also a powerful free radical inducing apoptosis.

University, Istanbul, Turkey. fpekiner@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is considered a syndrome with an unknown
cause. Roles of various trace elements and cytokines in saliva have been
implicated in the development of BMS. The aim of the present study was to compare
the levels of salivary trace elements [magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu)]
and interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-6, and to search for a correlation between
depression/anxiety and salivary trace elements and cytokines in BMS patients and 
controls.
METHODS: Thirty patients with BMS and 30 matched healthy controls participated in
the study. Unstimulated saliva was collected from participants and salivary flow 
rates were determined. Mg, Zn and Cu levels were determined by atomic absorbance 
spectrophotometry. Cytokine immunoassay kits were used to determine the
concentration of IL-2 and IL-6 in the whole saliva samples. Anxiety and
depression were analyzed by means of the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory (SAI-TAI) and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Although subjects in the control group had significantly higher mean
levels for Mg compared with BMS patients (P < 0.01), no statistically significant
differences were observed in relation to Zn and Cu levels between the two groups 
(P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in IL-2 and IL-6
levels of BMS and control groups, but subjects in BMS group had slightly, not
significantly, higher mean levels for IL-6 compared with controls. Subjects in
BMS group had significantly higher mean values for TAI compared with controls (P 
< 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in relation to
salivary levels of Mg, Zn, Cu, IL-2, IL-6 and depression/anxiety between BMS and 
control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that Mg levels could have an
impact on symptoms of BMS and further studies are necessary to determine the
importance of cytokines in the pathogenesis of BMS.

It is known that cancer is not a single transformational event. It is rather a
multistage process involving complex interactions with the surrounding cellular
microenvironment. Mast cells accumulate at sites of tumor growth in response to
numerous chemoattractants. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between
mast cell density (MCD) and myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinomas.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 35 unselected consecutive hysterectomy
specimens from patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma. C-kit-positive mast cell
assessment was performed in the myometrium adjacent to tumor tissue. A mean
number of <or=15 mast cells per high power field (HPF) were regarded as low mast 
cell density (L-MCD), and a count of >or=16 mast cells was regarded as high mast 
cell density (H-MCD). A significant correlation (p=0.018, Pearson Chi-Square
test) between H-MCD and the presence of myometrial invasion was demonstrated in
endometrial carcinomas. H-MCD was found in 54% of all cases, and 94% of H-MCD
cases had myometrial invasion, suggesting a role of mast cells or an interaction 
with tumor. Therapeutic modalities orientated to these cells or their
microenvironment as a new target for adjuvant treatment might determine the
prognosis in endometrial carcinomas.

The lungs and mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes from 26 sheep with ovine
pulmonary adenomatosis (OPA) were examined. Microscopically, the tumour was
disseminated throughout the lungs and displayed acinar or papillary growth. The
neoplastic cells were cuboidal or columnar with clear cytoplasm and a low mitotic
rate. Retrovirus antigen (Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus Capsid Protein, JSRV CA)
was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of tumour cells in the lung and lymph nodes by 
immunohistochemistry. The neoplastic cells had more diffuse and intense
expression of pulmonary surfactant protein-A (SP-A) compared with the expression 
of SP-B or SP-C. SP-A and SP-B expression was localized to the apical cytoplasm
of the neoplastic cells, whereas SP-C was most strongly expressed in the
perinuclear area of the tumour cells. In the lungs of two sheep, low numbers of
tumour cells expressed Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). The nuclei of the
neoplastic epithelial cells and of the germinal centre lymphocytes within the
peribronchiolar lymphoid tissue expressed the proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA). CD3(+) T lymphocytes infiltrated the pulmonary tissue and surrounded the 
neoplastic foci. The results of this study demonstrate that JSRV continues to
replicate in neoplastic cells after they have been transformed, and that the
neoplastic cells produce pulmonary surfactant proteins. A local T-cell response
occurs within affected lungs.

Ghrelin expression in cancers is either reduced/absent or increased depending on 
the organs involved. The aims of this study were to investigate: (i) whether
there are differences in ghrelin peptide expression between kidney tissues from a
series of renal cell carcinoma cases, oncocytomas, and normal controls; (ii)
whether there are correlations between tissue ghrelin levels in a series of renal
carcinoma cases and normal controls; and (iii) how normal is kidney ghrelin
expression per mg tissue as compared with the normal stomach tissue ghrelin
level. We studied 7 normal stomach and 7 normal kidney samples, 21 clear cell
renal carcinomas, 7 chromophobe type renal cell carcinomas (RCC), 7 papillary
type RCC, and 7 oncocytoma samples. Tissue ghrelin expression was measured by RIA
and immunohistochemistry. Grades 1-3 clear renal cell carcinomas, chromophobe
type RCC, papillary type RCC, and oncocytomas expressed 88%, 94%, 95%, 51%, 75%, 
and 48% less ghrelin than the normal kidney, respectively. Overall, we concluded 
that ghrelin expression in renal cell carcinoma tissues is always lower than that
in normal kidney or is absent. This low level or lack of ghrelin may play a role 
in the etiopathogenesis and progression of cancer.

Apoptosis-related proteins and proliferation activity and their relationship with
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are contemporary issues in pediatric non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma (pNHL). In this study prognostic or pathogenetic role of EBV latent
infection, proliferating activity, and apoptosis-regulating proteins in pNHL were
explored. EBV-EBER, lmp-1, ki-67, bcl-2, survivin, bax, fas, c-myc, p53 and
apoptotic index by TUNEL method were explored in 70 pNHL cases and evaluated
statistically. Of the 70 cases evaluated, 24 were female and 46 were male. Seven 
cases were stage I/II and 63 cases were stage III/IV. The mean age was 7.16 + or 
- 3.72(1-15). EBV was positive in (25.7%) cases. Overall survival was 82%, while 
event free survival was 75%. Bax was expressed in 40% of the cases, while the
expression of bcl-2,was 50%, survivin 42.9%, p53 8.6%, fas 18.6% and c-myc in
45.7%. Mean apoptotic index was 131.29 + or - 96.69 per 5,000 cells. Mean
proliferation index was 55.97% (12-92%). Fas positivity was high in EBV positive 
cases (p = 0.0001). EBV positivity was not related with prognosis. Apoptotic
index was found to be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.017). Our results
suggest that apoptosis-regulating proteins have a role in the pathogenesis of
pNHL. EBV was correlated with apoptotic index and fas, bcl-2. No correlation was 
observed with proliferation index and studied factors. High apoptotic index was
related with good prognosis.

p53 polymorphic variants play an important role in the determination of tumor
phenotype and characteristics in breast cancer. In this study, we examined three 
common polymorphisms in p53 gene and their haplotype combinations to assess their
potential association with inherited predisposition to breast cancer development,
in relations with the protein over-expression and patients' demographic data. A
total of 99 patients with breast cancer and 107 age-matched healthy controls were
included in the study. Genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP and DNA
sequencing techniques. Evaluation of p53 protein over-expression was also
examined by immunohistochemistry. Among three polymorphisms, increased codon 72
Pro allele frequency (p = 0.0067) and the presence of Pro allele were found to be
significantly associated with breast cancer (p = 0.013). A significant risk was
also found in subjects with combinations of specific haplotypes and genotypes.
Most of breast cancer women especially younger than 50 years carry at least one
p53 polymorphism (p = 0.001). There was no any association between these three
p53 polymorphisms and the protein over-expression, separately or in interaction, 
with breast cancer. In conclusion, presence of proline allele at codon 72 alone, 
and its special combinations with other two polymorphisms appear to be a
significant risk factor for breast cancer. Determination of well-known p53
polymorphisms might be a good predictor for breast cancer development especially 
in women younger than 50 years.

Osteopontin is a ligand for the integrin proteins, which are cell surface
receptors that mediate the physical and functional interactions between a cell
and the extracellular matrix. The expression of osteopontin is reportedly
increased in a number of transformed cell lines and tumor tissues. Furthermore,
increased expression of osteopontin results in some infiltrative features of
tumors. The aim of the study is to demonstrate that expression of osteopontin in 
human astrocytomas correlates with histological tumor grade. The expression of
osteopontin in human astrocytomas was determined with immunohistochemistry.
Median osteopontin expression levels were 1%, 7.5%, 60%, and 50% in grade I, II, 
III, and IV tumors, respectively. Osteopontin staining was significantly higher
in high grade (grade III-IV) than low grade (grade I-II) tumors. These findings
indicate that osteopontin immunoreactivity in human astrocytomas may correlate
with the grade of a tumor.

Can CD10 be used as a diagnostic marker in thyroid pathology?

Yegen G(1), Demir MA, Ertan Y, Nalbant OA, Tunçyürek M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey.

CD10-common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen is a membrane-bound zinc
metalloproteinase that is expressed by different hematopoietic cell types at
unique stages of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. It was reported to be
expressed in various nonlymphoid cells and tissue, as well as in various types of
neoplasms. Recently, it has been found to be useful in the differential diagnosis
of benign and malignant follicular-patterned lesions of the thyroid. In the
present study, we evaluated the staining pattern of CD10 in various thyroid
lesions, including 14 benign and 61 malignant cases, as well as in adjacent
thyroid tissue. CD10 was negative in normal thyroid tissue, adenomatous nodules, 
minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, and well-differentiated carcinoma. It
was expressed in nine of 14 (64.2%) conventional papillary carcinomas, four of 24
(16.6%) follicular variant of papillary carcinomas, three of six (50%) papillary 
microcarcinomas, one of nine (11.1%) widely invasive follicular carcinomas, and
three of ten (30%) follicular adenomas. In contrast to results of previous
studies, CD10 is not useful in the classification of thyroid follicular lesions
as benign or malignant, but it shows strong positivity in conventional papillary 
carcinoma.

Immunohistochemical expression of multidrug resistance proteins in mature
T/NK-cell lymphomas.

Saglam A(1), Hayran M, Uner AH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Oncology Institute, Hacettepe University Faculty of
Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is defined as resistance of tumor cells to a wide
spectrum of structurally and functionally unrelated drugs. One of the most
important mechanisms in mediating MDR is that involving cellular drug efflux
transporters. Drug resistance is a common and formidable obstacle to therapy in
mature T/NK-cell lymphomas and the MDR phenotype is thought to be one of the
contributing mechanisms. In this study we assessed the immunohistochemical
expression of P-gp (P-glycoprotein), MRP-1 (multidrug resistance associated
protein 1), BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) and LRP (lung resistance
protein) in 45 mature T/NK-cell lymphomas diagnosed at our hospital. We detected 
P-gp expression in 31% (13/42), MRP-1 expression in 74% (31/42), BCRP in 78%
(32/41) and LRP in 59% (26/44) of the cases. These findings show that our
T/NK-cell lymphoma cases display high frequency of MDR protein expression.

Collagen-elastic tissue changes and vascular involvement in granuloma annulare: a
review of 35 cases.

Güneş P(1), Göktay F, Mansur AT, Köker F, Erfan G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital,
Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of granuloma annulare (GA) is unclear. Collagen
fiber degeneration is commonly reported, and there are several conflicting
studies on elastic fiber and vascular changes associated with GA. In this study, 
we aimed to evaluate histopathologic characteristics, collagen and elastic tissue
changes and vascular changes in GA.
METHODS: Clinical records of 35 GA patients were examined alongside serial
sections of 38 biopsy specimens from these patients. New sections of biopsy
tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Verhoeff-van Gieson or Alcian
blue and then evaluated.
RESULTS: Four different histopathologic patterns were observed: interstitial
(57.9%), palisadic granulomatous (26.3%), sarcoidal granulomatous (5.3%) and
mixed (10.5%). Dermal mucin deposition was determined in 84.2% of specimens.
Solar elastosis was observed in only seven specimens, and elastophagocytosis was 
observed in only two specimens. Collagen and elastic tissue damages were
consistent findings in all biopsy specimens. Fibrin thrombi and vasculitic
changes were not found in any of the specimens from this patient group.
CONCLUSIONS: Elastic and collagen fiber damage are the main accompanying features
of GA, which may develop from delayed-type hypersensitivity. Vasculitis does not 
appear to be a major causative process. Sun exposure also seems to have no major 
effect on the formation of GA but can be one of the stimulants or predisposing
factors.

Exposure to formaldehyde, which is an organic compound, disturbs the integrity of
nasal mucosa. In this study, we aimed to clarify the protein changes in the
junctional complex of nasal mucosa of Wistar rats exposed to formaldehyde
inhalation. The study was performed in 20 female Wistar rats. Rats were divided
into two groups randomly. Control rats were allowed free access to standard rat
chaw and tap water (n:10). Experimental group was exposed to formaldehyde vapor
at 15ppm, 6h/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks (n:10). Histological evaluation of the
experimental model was determined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic acid
Schiff (PAS) stainings of paraffin-embedded nasal mucosa tissues and by electron 
microscopy. The effects of formaldehyde inhalation on the distribution of
occludin, E-cadherin, and gamma-catenin were assessed by immunohistochemistry.
The nasal mucosa of the experimental group was correlated with hypertrophy in
goblet cell, degeneration in basal lamina, stratification of epithelium, and
proliferation. Thickness of basal lamina and also local degenerative regions,
vacuole increase in cytoplasmic areas, irregular forms of kinocilium and loss of 
sharpness in the kinocilium membrane were the findings at the ultrastructural
level. The expressions of E-cadherin, occludin, gamma-catenin proteins in
intercellular junctional complexes of rat nasal mucosa were also decreased in
experimental group compared to control group. The findings of the present study
indicated that formaldehyde vapor inhalation in the concentrations and duration
of exposure used in the present experiment significantly decreased the density of
structural proteins of the junctional complex in the nasoepithelium. It was
suggested that, the formaldehyde inhalation could cause complete impairment of
intercellular junctional complexes and disturb the tissue integrity in nasal
mucosa at higher concentrations.

Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma (IPM) also called as intranodal hemorrhagic
spindle cell tumor with amianthoid fibers is a distinctive and rare mesenchymal
neoplasm of lymph nodes. This entity generally misdiagnosed as intranodal
Kaposi's sarcoma or schwannoma in past. In contrast to Kaposi's sarcoma, it
behaves in a benign fashion and does not need any further therapy except total
surgical resection of the mass. This neoplasm has a great predilection for the
inguinal region. The lesion presents typically as a unilateral, painless,
solitary mass. To our knowledge, approximately 53 cases of IPM have been reported
in the English-language literature. We present a 43-year-old-male patient with
IPM and discuss histological, immunohistochemical features and pathogenesis of
this rare benign neoplasm.

Anzer honey prevents N-ethylmaleimide-induced liver damage in rats.

Campus, Ankara, Turkey. aslid@hacettepe.edu.tr

N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) is a sulphydryl blocker which impairs the sulphydryl
dependent antioxidant system (mainly glutathione) in the body by alkylating
endogenous sulphydryls. This study was designed to investigate the effects of
Anzer honey on NEM-induced liver injury in rats. Thirty female Wistar albino rats
were divided equally into three groups. Group 1: control; Group 2: NEM; Group 3: 
Anzer honey+NEM. NEM (0.075mg kg(-1)) was given to both group 2 and 3
administered subcutaneously (s.c.) for 30 days. The animals in the Anzer
honey+NEM group were treated with Anzer honey at a dose of 0.275g kg(-1), (p.o.) 
at 1h prior to every NEM injection. At the end of the 30 day treatment period,
liver samples were taken for determination of the glutathione levels and
histological examination. NEM treatment alone caused a significant reduction of
the liver glutathione levels in group 2. Furthermore, NEM treatment caused
congestion and mononuclear cell infiltration in the liver when compared to the
control group. In group 3, Anzer honey treatment reversed all the changes in
glutathione level, as well as histopathological alterations, normally induced by 
NEM. The findings imply that depletion of glutathione concentration plays a
causal role in NEM-induced liver injury, and that the hepatoprotective effect of 
Anzer honey may be mediated through sulfhydryl-sensitive processes. They further 
imply that it may also possess antioxidant properties.

Tumor to tumor metastasis is a rare, but well recognized entity, most commonly
involving a carcinoma metastasis to a benign or low grade mesenchymal tumor. A
case of breast carcinoma metastasis in a recurrent myxoid liposarcoma is
presented in this study. A 52-year-old female patient with a history of breast
carcinoma (70% invasive lobular carcinoma and 30% invasive ductal carcinoma)
presented with a mass in the right lumbar region. The excised mass was diagnosed 
as myxoid liposarcoma. The tumor recurred twice and was reexcised. Microscopic
examination of the second recurrence revealed multiple foci of breast carcinoma
metastases in myxoid liposarcoma. Immunohistochemical study showed staining for
CK19, GCDFP-15, estrogen and progesterone in metastases. Both breast carcinoma
metastasis and myxoid liposarcoma were immunoreactive for E-cadherin and
beta-catenin. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of breast
carcinoma metastasis in myxoid liposarcoma, and the first occurrence of
metastasis in a liposarcoma.

Distinguishing malignant mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma and reactive mesothelial
proliferation in both cytologic and surgical pathologic specimens is often a
diagnostic challenge. Conventional cytomorphologic assessment is an important
step in the differential diagnosis of these entities.The pleural effusion
cytologies from 40 cases of malignant mesothelioma, 40 cases of adenocarcinoma
and 30 cases of reactive mesothelial proliferation diagnosed between 1997 and
2007 were reviewed. Twenty-seven cytologic features which are regarded as useful 
in the differential diagnosis of mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma and benign
mesothelial proliferation were assessed. These cytologic features were subjected 
to a stepwise logistic regression analysis. Three features were selected to
distinguish malignant mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma: giant atypical
mesothelial cell (P = 0.0001), nuclear pleomorphism (P = 0.0001) and acinar
structures (P = 0.0001), the latter two being characteristics of adenocarcinoma. 
The variables selected to differentiate malignant mesothelioma from reactive
mesothelial cells were: cell ball formation (P = 0.0001), cell in cell engulfment
(P = 0.0001) and monolayer cell groups (P = 0.0001), the latter being a feature
of benign mesothelial proliferation. When these selected variables were subjected
to a stepwise logistic regression analysis, the logistic model correctly
predicted 90% of cases of benign mesothelial proliferation versus 97.5% of
malignant mesothelioma and 92.5% of malignant mesothelioma versus 92.5% of
adenocarcinoma.Conventional cytomorphologic assessment is the first step to
establish an accurate diagnosis in pleural effusions. Several cytologic features 
have predictive value to separate malignant mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma and 
reactive mesothelial proliferation.

The effects of surfactant and antenatal corticosteroid treatment on the pulmonary
pathology of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

University Medical School, Sihhiye/Ankara 06100, Turkey. ozlemt@hacettepe.edu.tr

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of antenatal steroid
treatment and/or postnatal surfactant replacement therapy on the incidence and
extent of selected histopathological findings. Seventy complete autopsies were
reviewed, and only lung tissues were examined and graded. Infants were divided
into treatment and control groups as follows: group 1: surfactant-treated infants
(n=15); group 2: infants whose mothers were given steroid treatment (n=16); group
3: surfactant-treated infants whose mothers were given steroid treatment (n=10). 
The control group included 29 patients not treated with surfactant and steroid.
The overall incidence and severity of hyaline membrane and pulmonary hemorrhage
were similar in each treatment group when compared to the control group. However,
when the treatment groups were compared with each other, the incidence of severe 
hyaline membrane was more common in group 1 than in group 3. A significant
reduction in severe hyaline membrane was associated with combined surfactant and 
antenatal steroid therapy. However, the cause for the similar incidence of
selected histopathological findings in the treatment groups and the control group
may be linked to oxygen toxicity due to insufficient antioxidant capacity in
premature infants and barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.

Galectin-3 is a ss-galactoside-binding lectin. It participates in a variety of
normal and pathologic processes, including cancer progression. In this study, we 
evaluated the pattern of expression of galectin-3 in cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and its correlation with the
grade of differentiation in SCC and tumor size. Galectin-3 expression was
evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 31 SCCs, 30 BCCs, and 29 non-tumoral skin
samples. Galectin-3 expression was higher in normal epidermis than in
non-melanoma skin cancers, except for cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in SCC.
Cytoplasmic galectin-3 immunoreactivity was significantly higher than nuclear
immunoreactivity in non-melanoma skin cancers. Cytoplasmic galectin-3
immunoreactivity was significantly higher in SCC than in both circumscribed and
infiltrative BCCs, but no difference was detected between these two types of BCC.
Cytoplasmic galectin-3 immunoreactivity predominated within SCCs (p=0.000), and a
positive correlation was detected between tumor size and cytoplasmic
immunoreactivity (r=0.385, p=0.043). There was no correlation between galectin-3 
staining and tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Decreased nuclear
galectin-3 expression and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in tumors are important
factors in the progression from the normal to the cancerous state in non-melanoma
skin cancers. We speculate that cytoplasmic galectin-3 expression may be one of
the factors that contribute to tumor aggressiveness in SCC.

Astrocytes are more resistant to focal cerebral ischemia than neurons and die by 
a delayed necrosis.

Several recent reports proposed that astrocyte death might precede neuronal
demise after focal ischemia, contrary to the conventional view that astrocytes
are more resistant to injury than neurons. Interestingly, there are findings
supporting each of these opposing views. To clarify these controversies, we
assessed astrocyte viability after 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. 
In contrast to neighboring neurons, astrocytes were alive and contained glycogen 
across the ischemic area 6 h after reperfusion, and at the expanding outer border
of the infarct at later time points. These glycogen-positive astrocytes had
intact plasma membranes. Astrocytes lost plasmalemma integrity much later than
neurons: 19 +/- 22 (mean +/- standard deviation), 58 +/- 14 and 69 +/- 3% of
astrocytes in the perifocal region became permeable to propidium iodide (PI) at
6, 24, 72 h after ischemia, respectively, in contrast to 81 +/- 2, 96 +/- 3, 97
+/- 2% of neurons. Although more astrocytes in the cortical and subcortical core 
regions were PI-positive, their numbers were considerably less than those of
neurons. Lysosomal rupture (monitored by deoxyribonuclease II immunoreactivity)
followed a similar time course. Cytochrome-c immunohistochemistry showed that
astrocytes maintained mitochondrial integrity longer than neurons. EM confirmed
that astrocyte ultrastructure including mitochondria and lysosomes disintegrated 
much later than that of neurons. We also found that astrocytes died by a delayed 
necrosis without significantly activating apoptotic mechanisms although they
rapidly swelled at the onset of ischemia.

The prognostic significance of microvascular density (MVD) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were investigated in 15 patients with
adenocarcinoma (AC) and 15 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Immunohistochemically, VEGF and factor VIII were applied. The average microvessel
counts were given as MVD, and VEGF expression was given as VEGF percentage area
and VEGF staining degree. Higher values of MVD were obtained in patients with AC 
(11.47 +/- 3.48) when compared with patients with SCC (7.47 +/- 2.50; P = .001)
and also in patients at early stages of disease (10.77 +/- 3.24) when compared
with patients at advanced stages (8.47 +/- 3.64; P = .050). A significant
correlation was shown between MVD and VEGF percentage area (P = .006) and between
VEGF percentage area and VEGF staining degree (P = .000). No significant
difference was found in VEGF percentage area between patients with SCC and AC and
between patients at early and advanced stages. In conclusion, VEGF or MVD should 
not be regarded as a solitary prognostic factor but should be supported by other 
prognostic factors.

Diagnosis of low-grade clear cell lesions in kidney can be challenging to the
pathologist in practice. There is limited information in the literature
addressing the practical issues that may be encountered in this regard. Herein is
presented two cases: one was an adrenal cortical nodule; the second, an
intrarenal adrenal heterotopia that was assumed to be renal cell carcinoma
initially. Certain red flags should prompt pathologists to investigate further;
close morphological examination including immunohistochemistry may be warranted
in these lesions.

Dialysis remains the most common treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
Although the increased risk of cancer after renal transplant is well documented, 
there is less certainty about the risk of cancer in patients treated only with
dialysis. From 1997 to 2002, 262 ESRD patients received a Pap test at Başkent
University. The smears of 149 patients who had ESRD for more than 9 months were
compared with the smears of 150 otherwise healthy patients. All of the Pap smears
were re-examined according to Bethesda 2001 criteria. The mean age of the
patients was 42.88 years. Regarding micro-organisms, no statistically significant
difference between the groups were observed. In 36 Pap smears, a shift in flora
suggestive of bacterial vaginosis was detected. There were statistically
significant differences between the groups. When age was considered as a marker
of atrophy, atrophy in patients younger than 50 years was statistically different
between the groups. Also, we determined that the shift in flora suggestive of
bacterial vaginosis and atrophy in patients aged younger than 50 years did not
depend on the length of hemodialysis. Of 13 patients (4.3%) who had epithelial
cell abnormalities there were not statistically significant differences between
the groups. In conclusion, according to our study, CRF seems not to be a
predictive factor for cervical cancer. Shift in flora suggestive of bacterial
vaginosis and atrophy in patients aged younger than 50 years might be the natural
effects of uremia, and they appear not to be dependent on the length of the
hemodialysis period.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine the efficacy of remote ischaemic
preconditioning in the hind limb of rats for ischaemic damage of the spinal cord 
through neurological and histological investigation and examination of heat shock
proteins (HSP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three
groups as Group 1 (control group, n=10), Group 2 (ischaemia control group, n=10),
and Group 3 (remote ischaemia preconditioning group, n=10). The right lower limb 
of the rats in the study group was compressed with a tourniquet for three cycles 
of ten-minute ischaemia followed by ten-minute reperfusion. After a period of 8
hours, the peritoneal cavity was accessed through a midline vertical incision.
The abdominal aorta was clamped between the origin of the renal arteries and the 
iliac arteries for 45 minutes and spinal cord ischaemia was induced. The same
procedure of abdominal aorta clamping was performed in the control group without 
creating leg ischaemia. The rats were evaluated for neurological parameters at 24
and 48 hours. At the end of this time period, all rats were sacrificed and the
spinal cords were stained for determination of HSP and histopathological
classification. For immunohistochemical evaluation, the samples were analyzed
according to the degree of staining with HSP70 rabbit antibody.
RESULTS: After completing the neurological examinations and histological
evaluations, we determined the spinal cords of the animals in the sham group to
be completely normal. The post-operative neurological examination scores of Group
3 at 24 and 48 hours were significantly higher than scores measured in the other 
two groups. There were seven rats with HSP expression and this was detected in
animals pretreated with remote ischaemic preconditioning. There were also two
rats in Group 2 with HSP expression.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that production of transient remote ischaemia
preconditioning in the lower extremities reduces damage in the spinal cord
secondary to ischaemia probably by the increase of HSP.

Malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast are rare biphasic neoplasms, the stromal
component of which may show homologous and heterologous sarcomatous elements.
Malignant epithelial transformation is rare. It has been reported in a few cases 
of in situ and infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma. Rarely, breast
carcinomas and phyllodes tumors may also develop in the same breast independent
of each other. To our knowledge, this is the first case of two different types of
tumor occurring in the same breast at the same time in a post-osteosarcoma case.

Diagnostic pitfalls in the evaluation of fine needle aspiration cytology of the
thyroid: correlation with histopathology in 260 cases.

Haberal AN(1), Toru S, Ozen O, Arat Z, Bilezikçi B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Başkent University, Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVES: Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid is a
non-invasive, cost-effective screening procedure that is valuable for
distinguishing neoplastic lesions from non-neoplastic nodules. The aim of this
study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of FNACs performed at our
institution by correlating FNAC results with histopathological diagnoses.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-one aspiration cytology specimens followed by
thyroidectomy were included in the study, and the results of 260 adequate FNACs
were compared with their histological diagnoses.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of thyroid FNAC for detecting neoplasia 
were 92.6% and 91.6%, respectively. There were 15 (5.7%) false positives and six 
(2.3%) false negatives.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that follicular cells that exhibit some of the
features of papillary carcinoma could be observed in a cytology slide of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, leading to a diagnostic pitfall. In addition,
cellularity and overlapping cytological criteria in hyperplasia might lead to a
false diagnosis.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of royal
jelly against paracetamol-induced liver damage. The study was conducted in 90
female Swiss Albino mice, and six groups were established. While the first group 
was maintained as control, Groups 2-6 were administered 200mg/kg RJ for 1 day,
200mg/kg RJ for 7 days, 400mg/kg PAR for 1 day, 200mg/kg RJ plus 400mg/kg PAR for
1 day and 200mg/kg RJ for 7 days and then second 400mg/kg PAR on the 7th day,
orally, respectively. It was shown that PAR significantly increased serum ALT,
AST, ALP, liver MDA levels and significantly decreased liver GSH-Px activity,
when compared to the control group (Group 1). On the other hand, meaningful
changes were observed in the biochemical parameters of the group which was
administered long-term RJ (Group 6). The aforementioned parameters which were
statistically significant were determined to have drawn closer to values of the
control group, and among these, the existing statistical differences for MDA
level and GSH-Px activity between the trial group (Group 6) and the control group
disappeared (Group 1). Compared to the pathological changes observed in the liver
parenchyma, remark cords, sinusoids and hepatocytes in the group which was
administered paracetamol alone (Group 4), lesions were determined to be less
severe particularly in the group (Group 6) which received royal jelly for 7 days 
prior to paracetamol. In conclusion, the administration of royal jelly as a
hepatoprotective agent for 7 days against paracetamol-induced liver damage was
determined to exhibit marked protective effect on liver tissue.

In this study, the antioxidant effect of aminoguanidine on nephrotoxicity of a
single dose of cisplatin is investigated and compared with the effects of
well-known antioxidants vitamin C and E combination. Tubular damage and
perivascular inflammation were observed in kidney samples of the
cisplatin-administered groups. Aminoguanidine and vitamin C-E combination are
found to be capable of preventing these effects of cisplatin. Liver tissues of
all groups were intact. Cisplatin-induced oxidative stress was evidenced by
significant decrease in glutathione and significant increase in malondialdehyde
levels in kidney samples. Antioxidants with cisplatin decreased malondialdehyde
levels. Antioxidants with cisplatin prevented the decrease in liver glutathione
levels. The nephrotoxicity was confirmed biochemically by significant elevation
of serum urea and creatinine levels. Both vitamin C-E combination and
aminoguanidine prevented the increase in serum urea levels according to the
cisplatin group.

E-cadherin, beta-catenin adhesion complex and relation to matrilysin expression
in pT3 rectosigmoid cancers.

E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex has a critical role in cell-cell adhesion.
beta-Catenin is a critical component of the highly conserved Wnt signaling
pathway that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Wnt signaling
leads to the stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin and to translocation to the 
nucleus, where it binds with T-cell factor and promotes the transcription and
changes in target gene expression, including matrix metalloproteinases. In this
study, we analyzed paraffin-embedded specimens from 42 patients with pT3
rectosigmoid cancer for E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and matrix
metalloproteinase-7(MMP-7, matrilysin) expression using immunohistochemistry.
Seventy-four and 79% of tumors expressed beta-catenin and E-cadherin,
respectively. Nuclear expression of beta-catenin was detected only in 26.1% of
tumors. Forty-five percent of the rectosigmoid cancers showed strong expression
of MMP-7. It was revealed that membranous or cytoplasmic beta-catenin expression 
was significantly related to E-cadherin and MMP-7 expression. No significant
association was seen between E-cadherin, beta-catenin, or MMP-7 expression and
some clinicopathologic features. Our results may contribute to the functional
interaction between beta-catenin and MMP-7. Further studies on Wnt/beta-catenin
and MMP-7 gene activity and protein expression are necessary to better understand
the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.

Sogüt S.

We investigated the effects of erdosteine on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced
hepatotoxicity in rats. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione
peroxidase (GSH-Px), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and ALT (alanine
transaminase) activities, and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide levels as 
oxidant/antioxidant biochemical parameters were investigated with light
microscopic evaluation in adult female Wistar Albino rats. APAP administration
produced a decrease in hepatic SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities, and
coadministration of erdosteine (150 and 300 mg/kg) resulted in increases in the
activities. MDA and NO levels increased in the APAP group, and erdosteine
treatments prevented these increases. Significant elevations in serum AST and ALT
levels were observed in the APAP group, and when erdosteine and APAP were
coadministered, their serum levels were close to those in the control group.
Light microscopic evaluation of livers showed that there were remarkable
centrilobular (zone III) hepatic necrosis and mild to moderate sinusoidal
congestion in the APAP group, whereas in the erdosteine group, cellular necrosis 
was minimal and the hepatocytes maintained a better morphology when compared to
the APAP group. Erdosteine prevented APAP-induced liver injury and toxic side
effects probably through the antioxidant and radical scavenging effects of
erdosteine.

Chorangiosis is considered to be strongly associated with various fetal,
maternal, and placental disorders, including pre-eclampsia, diabetes,
hypertension, and major congenital anomalies, and has been found to correlate
with increased fetal morbidity and mortality. In this study, we investigated the 
pathologic effects of maternal smoking and air pollution on the pathogenesis of
chorangiosis. We investigated 92 placentas macroscopically and microscopically
over a 3-month period (March 2006-May 2006) at Denizli State Hospital to identify
the frequency of chorangiosis and the potential role of maternal smoking and air 
pollution. Placental changes were examined by light microscopy after hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical evaluation of CD 34 and CD 68;
muscle-specific actin was used to confirm the diagnosis. Among the 92 mothers
included in the study, 33 were smokers (group I), 31 were thought to have been
exposed to air pollution (group II), and 28 were living in rural areas free of
air pollution and maternal smoking (group III). Chorangiosis was found in 14%
(13/92) of all placentas: 7 (53.8%) cases were assigned to group I, 5 (38.5%) to 
group II, and 1 (7.7%) to group III. Vascular changes were found mainly in the
smoking and air pollution groups. There appeared to be no correlation of these
vascular changes with placental weight, parity, gestational age, major congenital
anomalies, and maternal factors, including diabetes and pre-eclampsia. We presume
that smoking and air pollution may contribute to the development of chorangiosis.
We suggest that chorangiosis may be an adaptive response to maternal hypoxia, and
studies addressing the role of smoking and air pollution in chorangiosis may
provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this condition.

BACKGROUND: Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an
unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity. Although the 
etiology is unknown, neural and psychologic factors and cytokines may be
implicated in the pathogenesis of burning mouth syndrome. The aim of this study
was to investigate the relationship between serum cytokine and T regulatory cell 
levels in patients with burning mouth syndrome with regard to depression and
anxiety.
METHODS: Thirty patients with burning mouth syndrome and 30 matched controls
participated in the study. Serum cytokine levels were measured with cytometric
bead array and T regulatory cells were defined as CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp-3(+) cells by
flow cytometry. The level of anxiety and depression were analyzed by means of the
Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. 
Visual analogue scale was used in the quantification of burning levels of
patients.
RESULTS: Serum IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels were significantly decreased in patients
with burning mouth syndrome compared with controls [mean 16.79 +/- 8.70 vs. 37.73
+/- 41.05 pg / ml (P < 0.05) and mean 39.09 +/- 29.40 vs. 70.83 +/- 42.44 pg / ml
(P < 0.01) respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: IL-2 and TNF-alpha might play a role in burning mouth syndrome.
Burning mouth syndrome may occur as a sign of predisposition to autoimmunity.
Presence of low levels of CD28(+) supports the provision that BMS might be a
pre-autoimmune disease.

Cyclin A expression is associated with apoptosis and mitosis in murine
3-methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcomas.

The chemical carcinogen MCA induces fibrosarcoma and tissue damage at the
injection site. Despite the importance of ROS in the development of cancer,
little is known about the pattern of expression of ROS in MCA-induced
fibrosarcomas. To gain some insight into the biological significance of iNOS and 
Cu/Zn-SOD, comparative immunohistochemical analyses were performed to
characterize their expression in MCA-induced fibrosarcomas. Cyclin A is
overexpressed in various tumors, but its expression in MCA-induced fibrosarcoma
in mice and its correlation to mitosis and apoptosis are unclear. The presence of
apoptotic cell death was evaluated using the TUNEL method and findings were
compared with cyclin A expression and mitotic count of fibrosarcomas.
Subcutaneous application of MCA caused fibrosarcoma development in 14 of 20 mice 
(70%) in 26 weeks. Limited cytoplasmic Cu/Zn-SOD and iNOS immunostainings were
detected in 13 of 14 and 9 of 14 tumors with median immunoreactive scores of 2
and 1, respectively. Prominent nuclear cyclin A immunostaining and TUNEL-positive
reactions were seen in all the fibrosarcoma cases. Cyclin A immunoreaction
significantly correlated with the TUNEL index (P<0.01) and MC (P<0.001). The
present findings show a low level of iNOS expression in neoplastic cells
indicating limited synthesizing capacity of tumor cells. Limited Cu/Zn-SOD
reaction could be associated with an imbalance in between pro-oxidant/antioxidant
levels. Furthermore, it was shown that cyclin A is overexpressed in MCA-induced
fibrosarcomas and possibly plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of
fibrosarcomas. Cyclin A could be useful for detecting the S phase of the cell
cycle and could also indicate that cyclin A may induce S phase arrest associated 
with apoptosis in the MCA-induced fibrosarcomas.

Maspin, E-selectin, and P-selectin expressions in papillary thyroid carcinomas
and their correlation with prognostic parameters.

Maspin is a serine protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin family, and is
known as a tumor-suppressor protein. Maspin also exhibits an inhibitor effect on 
angiogenesis. Cell adhesion molecules such as E- and P-selectin are known to play
an important role in the metastasis mechanism. We evaluated the expression of
maspin, E- and P-selectin in 74 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 19 of which had
lymph node metastases, and statistically analyzed the relationship between these 
three proteins and their relation with prognostic factors. Positive correlations 
were found for maspin positivity and lymph node metastases; thyroid capsule
invasion and perithyroidal soft tissue invasion; E-selectin positivity and lymph 
node metastases, lymphovascular invasion and perithyroidal soft tissue invasion; 
and P-selectin positivity and lymph node metastases and lymphovascular invasion
(p < 0.05). Statistically significant correlations were also found between
maspin, E- and P-selectin expressions with each other and with tumor stage (p <
0.05). Inactive cytoplasmic maspin cannot act as a tumor suppressor. Expression
of E- and P-selectins in tumor cells facilitates the occurrence of metastases,
lymphovascular invasion, and perithyroidal soft tissue invasion. Further studies,
in particular molecular investigations, are needed to reveal the detailed
interactions between maspin, E-selectin, and P-selectin expression.

Cyclosporine A (CyA) leads to liver injury, probably by causing the production of
free radicals and resulting in nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. We evaluated
CyA-mediated liver damage histopathologically to determine the possible
beneficial effects of L-arginine (L-Arg). In this study, 7 groups of
Sprague-Dawley rats; (1) Control group; (2) 0.9% NaCl group; (3) CyA group:
7.5mg/kg/day; (4) L-Arg group: 2g/lt/day; (5) l-NAME (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester) group: 5mg/100ml/day; (6) CyA+L-Arg group: L-Arg (2g/lt/day)+CyA
(7.5mg/kg/day); and (7) CyA+L-NAME group: CyA (7.5mg/kg/day)+L-NAME
(5mg/100ml/day) were included. At the end of the treatments, animals were killed 
and hepatic tissues were treated for morphological (hematoxylin and eosin) and
biochemical (NO and malondialdehyde, MDA) analyses, and serum was processed for
biochemical (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), bilirubin,
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total protein) study. The results indicated that
CyA-induced hepatotoxicity was characterized by sinusoidal dilatation,
hepatocellular vacuolization, neutrophilic infiltration and hepatocellular
necrosis. These findings were less pronounced in the CyA+L-Arg group than CyA
alone group. L-NAME group showed moderate changes. The CyA+L-NAME (Group 7) had
more severe changes. We found changes in tissue NO and MDA levels. We think that 
the tissue damage caused by CyA is mild and reversible at the period when
biochemical parameters are just starting to become abnormal and that L-Arg may
have a protective effect against CyA damage on liver.

CDX2 is a homeobox domain-containing transcription factor that is important in
the development and differentiation of the intestine. In this study, we examined 
CDX2 expression in normal and neoplastic human colon using a newly isolated
monoclonal antibody. When compared to the intensity observed in adjacent normal
mucosal epithelial cells, strong nuclear staining for CDX2 was observed in 10
(100%) of 10 colonic adenomas, 30 (88.2%) of 34 colorectal adenocarcinomas,
including 17(94.47%) of 18 well-or moderately differentiated tumors and 13(81.2%)
of 16 high-grade tumors. The percentage of CDX2 immunopositive cells was
generally lower in carcinomas than in adenomas (p<0.001) and lower in moderately 
or poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors (p<0.001).
There was an inverse correlation between CDX2 expression and tumor grade, tumor
stage and lymph node metastasis (respectively, p<0.001; p<0.05; p<0.001), but
this was not associated with age, gender, or tumor location and size. These
results indicate that loss of expression of CDX2 protein may play an important
role in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancers. Down-regulation of CDX2 may
cause dedifferentiation of gastrointestinal epithelial cells.

Galectin-3 plays important roles in cell adhesion, cell proliferation, apoptosis,
neoplastic transformation, and metastasis. Galectin-3 expression has been
evaluated in various malignant neoplasms to determine its effectiveness in
differential diagnosis from benign lesions and its effects on carcinogenesis.
There are few and somewhat controversial results regarding its changes through
cancer progression in thyroid malignancies. We studied the presence of galectin-3
expression immunohistochemically and its relation with tumor invasiveness and
lymph node metastasis in 89 cases of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Galectin
overexpression was less frequent in cases with lymph node metastases compared
with cases without lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001). Metastatic foci in lymph
nodes showed a lower degree of galectin-3 overexpression than their primary
lesions (P = 0.001). Degree of galectin-3 overexpression was also lower in larger
tumors (P = 0.009). Additionally, a decreased level of galectin-3 overexpression 
was observed at the invasive edges of the tumors (P = 0.001). Galectin-3
overexpression is more profound in early stages of papillary carcinoma, and its
expression intensity decreases during tumor progression. This finding is
consistent with roles for galectin-3 in cell adhesion to other tumor cells and
the matrix.

Using the 1998 World Health Organization/International Society of Urological
Pathology (WHO/ISUP) (2004 WHO), 1999 WHO/ISUP, and 1973 WHO classifications, we 
examined Ki67, BCL-2, TP53, and MDM-2 expressions in invasive and noninvasive
urothelial neoplasias of the bladder of 72 patients, and compared the results
regarding tumor category and grade with clinical outcome to determine the
clinicopathological relevance of these classifications. Ki67 and TP53 expressions
were correlated with tumor grades of the 1973 WHO classification, and they also
distinguished "papillary urothelial neoplasm with low malignant potential" from
other WHO/ISUP grades (p < 0.05). No difference was observed for Ki67 and TP53
expressions between the other WHO/ISUP grades (p > 0.05). Neither tumor grade nor
tumor category correlated with MDM-2 or BCL-2 expressions (p > 0.05). WHO/ISUP
classifications are obviously not superior to the 1973 WHO classification for
grading urothelial neoplasia of the bladder. However, if the "papillary
urothelial neoplasm with low malignant potential" is distinguished from grade 1
tumors of the 1973 WHO classification, more precise prognostic information may be
obtained.

Polymorphism at +813 locus of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene is
considered to decrease predisposition to sarcoidosis. Our study aimed to
investigate the roles of this polymorphism in the development and extent of
sarcoidosis. We examined polymorphisms of the VEGF gene in 90 cases with
histopathological diagnosis of sarcoidosis and in 110 healthy subjects. VEGF +813
gene polymorphisms were determined using a polymerase chain reaction-based method
after DNA isolation. A significant increase in the frequency of the T allele was 
found in healthy subjects (odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.97,
P<0.05). Our results suggest that increase in rarer T allele at + 813 locus of
VEGF gene may diminish susceptibility to sarcoidosis in Turkish population.

Adhesion molecules have a role in many vasculitic disorders. Our aim was to
evaluate the status of adhesion molecules in nodular lesions of Behçet syndrome
(BS) and compare them with results for the 2 most common types of panniculitis,
erythema nodosum (EN) and nodular vasculitis (NV). We included the data for 28
patients with nodular lesions of BS, 24 with EN, and 22 with NV. A panel of
monoclonal antibodies against E-selectin, P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 were applied. The distribution and intensity of
adhesion molecules were assessed. There were no statistically significant
differences between the BS and control groups in regard to these adhesion
molecules except for ICAM-1. The percentage of strongly ICAM-1-stained
endothelial cells in subcutaneous fat tissue in relation to the total number of
endothelial cells was the lowest in BS (P= .0208). Because many lesions of BS
were related to an enhanced inflammatory response, the lower percentage of ICAM-1
expression seems counterintuitive.

OBJECTIVE: To assess ocular surface changes in patients with chronic renal
failure (CRF), to compare the results with the duration of illness.
STUDY DESIGN: Impression cytology from 48 patients with CRF on regular
hemodialysis and 16 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. Specimens
were taken from the temporal bulbar conjunctiva using cellulose acetate filter
paper.
RESULTS: Among the patients with CRF who were ill for 0-10 years, 25 patients
(78.1%) disclosed grade 0-1, and 7 patients (21.9%) disclosed grade 2-3 cytologic
changes, whereas in those with the duration of CRF > 10 years, 9 patients (56.2%)
had grade 0-1 and 7 patients (43.8%) had grade 2-3 changes. Specimens from the
control group revealed 93.8% grade 0-1 and 6.2% grade 2-3 changes (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The ocular surfaces of patients with CRF differ significantly from
those of normal individuals, and the severity of conjunctival changes is related 
to the duration of CRF.

Human Parvovirus B19 has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of
testicular germ cell tumors, but this could not have been confirmed. This study
was designed to investigate the testicular persistence of Parvovirus B19 and
possible associations with germ cell tumors. Paraffin-embedded or fresh tissues
from 36 germ cell tumors, 20 germ cell aplasias, 26 normal testicular tissues, 20
liver tissues, and 20 spleen tissues were evaluated by two different molecular
assays: a nested PCR for Parvovirus B19 capsid genes and a commercial
quantitative real-time PCR. Positive results were further confirmed by another
commercial real-time PCR assay. Viral DNA was detected in 3 of 36 (8.3%) germ
cell tumors, but not in other groups. Viral loads observed in all positive
samples were less than 20 IU/reaction, suggesting very low levels of viral
replication or latency. These results either directly or indirectly imply the
involvement of Parvovirus B19 with testicular germ cell tumors. Viral persistence
in normal testis, germ cell aplasia tissues, or hepatic/splenic tissues was not
observed in this study.

Is it possible to start the treatment based on immediate cytologic evaluation of 
core needle biopsy of the spinal lesions?

Core needle biopsy is widely used to diagnose spinal lesions. Final
histopathological report of the specimen usually can be given after several days.
These several days delay may prevent early treatment in some patients. Our aim
was to investigate if treatment of spinal lesions could be started according to
the immediate cytologic evaluation of the core needle biopsy. The cytological
materials of the 213 core needle spinal biopsy were prepared immediately after
biopsy procedure. Of these biopsies, only 101 core needle biopsy had a final
diagnosis which formed the backbone of the current study. Cytological materials
of these cases were compared with both histopathologic results of the core biopsy
and with final diagnosis obtained by open surgery or clinical follow up.
According to final diagnoses 40 patients had infections, 59 patients had
neoplasms and 2 patients had no pathology. When the diagnosis that determines the
treatment is considered, the overall success rates (positive predictive
value:PPV) of cytology and histology were 0.65 and 0.76 respectively. Moreover
when the specific diagnosis were analyzed separetely in the subgroups of
tuberculous infection, lymphoma and plasmacytoma; PPV of both cytological and
histological assessments was 1.00. In spinal metastasis, PPV was 0.97 for
cytology and 1.00 for histology. Rapid cytologic interpretation of core needle
biopsy material is a useful and reliable tool to determine the spinal lesions
which require urgent treatment. When the cytological specimen reveals the
diagnosis of spinal metastasis, lymphoma, plasmacytoma or tuberculosis, the
treatment may be started without waiting the result of the histological
examination.

Anatoxin-a, a potent neurotoxin, is one of a number of toxins produced by
cyanobacteria especially some strains of Anabaena. Toxic cyanobacteria are found 
worldwide in inland and coastal water environments. The present study was
performed to evaluate the toxicity of anatoxin-a on testes and sperm counts of
male mice. The animals of the treatment groups were administered with 50, 100 and
150microg/kg/day anatoxin-a for seven consecutive days by intraperitoneal (i.p.) 
route. Although there were no significant changes in body weight gain, and
absolute and relative testes weights, absolute and relative weights of cauda
epididymis reduced significantly in the 100 and 150microg/kg groups when compared
with control group. The number of sperm count in cauda epididymis was reduced
dose dependently in all treatment groups compared with control animals.
Anatoxin-a caused dose-dependent histopathological changes in the testes of mice 
such as degenerations in seminiferous tubules, intercellular disassociation of
spermatogenetic cell lines, sloughing of germ cells into tubular lumen,
vacuolisation in Sertoli cells and loss of germ cells. The epithelial thickness
of seminiferous tubules decreased significantly in all treatment groups in a
dose-dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of
ovarian cysts, especially in the young and when a nonneoplastic cyst is
suspected. A case is presented with its cystic fluid, FNA and imprint
cytopathology findings diagnosed as cystic adult granulosa cell tumor of the
ovary (AGCT).
CASE: Cystic fluid and FNA material of a 24-year-old female patient with a
left-sided cystic ovarian mass 11.5 cm in diameter was sent intraoperatively for 
cytopathologic examination. In aspiration cytopathology of AGCT, the presence of 
regular tumor cells with or without nuclear grooves arranged in a follicular
pattern mimicking a Call-Exner body has been regarded as the characteristic
cellular feature of the tumor.
CONCLUSION: For correct interpretation of the cytopathologic findings, close
communication with the clinician performing the aspiration is of vital
importance.

BACKGROUND: Follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcoma is a neoplastic proliferation
of spindled to ovoid cells showing morphologic and phenotypic features of
follicular dendritic cells. It is a rare tumor that can present in nodal and
extranodal sites.
CASE: A 41-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of an enlarging lump in
her neck. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed. FNA findings led to the
diagnosis of malignant tumor. We suggested that it was an FDC sarcoma. The tumor 
was excised. On microscopic examination, the tumor largely replaced the lymph
node. It was composed of oval to spindle cells arranged in sheets and interlacing
fascicles with a storiform pattern. The tumor cells showed widespread
immunopositivity for CD21. Based on these findings the diagnosis of FDC sarcoma
was made. Two years later local recurrence occurred.
CONCLUSION: FDC sarcoma has characteristic FNA findings. Once FDC sarcoma is
suspected cytologically or histologically, immunohistochemical stains must be
performed for reaching the correct diagnosis. Awareness of this rare entity is
necessary to avoid its underrecognition.

A 41-year-old man presented with headache, right-sided ophthalmic pain and visual
deficit. His neurological examination was normal except for bitemporal
hemianopsia and right lower quadranopsia. MRI demonstrated a mass arising from
the pituitary gland. Hormonal analysis revealed an elevated prolactin level of
4700 ng/mL (normal 4.04-15.2 ng/mL). MRI revealed hypointense signal on
T2-weighted images. Moreover, we also concluded that foci with no intravenous
contrast enhancement represent the amyloid deposits. The patient underwent
trans-sphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma. Histological examination
revealed an adenoma with spheroid amyloid deposits adjacent to prolactin-staining
adenoma cells. The patient recovered from the surgery without complications.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is upregulated in gastric carcinoma, and its increased
levels were found to have a prognostic significance in some studies. Both
angiogenesis and Helicobacter pylori infection have been reported to be
associated with COX-2 expression of gastric cancer in recent studies. In this
study, COX-2 expression and its association with CD31 staining, H.-pylori
infection, and well-known clinicopathological factors were investigated in 65
gastric cancer patients. COX-2 and CD31 expression assessment was done by
immunohistochemical methods. Whartin Starry stain was performed for H.-pylori
infection. Of 65 patients, 32 (49%) revealed intense COX-2 immunostaining. Among 
various clinicopathologic characteristics, COX-2 expression was inversely
correlated with tumor size, TNM stage, and lymph node status. Thirty-two (49%)
patients revealed intense CD31 immunostaining. Among various clinicopathologic
characteristics, CD31 expression was associated only with lymph node metastasis. 
COX-2 expression was not correlated with CD31 staining and H.-pylori infection.
Both COX-2 and CD31 staining had no prognostic significance. In conclusion, we
found that COX-2 expression was significantly higher in earlier stages of gastric
cancer. It can be suggested that COX-2 expression may be important in the initial
development of gastric cancer but not in progression of the disease. Other
factors which may be associated with COX-2 in gastric cancer, including
angiogenesis and H.-pylori infection, should be investigated in further studies.

Concurrent infection with peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and pestivirus 
was diagnosed in stillborn twin lambs. With the flock history, the findings of
epidermal syncytial cells and necrotizing bronchitis/bronchiolitis prompted
testing for PPRV infection, and PPRV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) in the skin, lungs, kidneys, rumen, and thymus. Macroscopic anomalies that 
were typical of border disease included scoliosis, brachygnathism, prognathism,
arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, and hairy fleece;
pestiviral antigen was detected by IHC in the brain, liver, lungs, and kidneys.
Tissues from both lambs were positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) for PPRV and pestivirus. To the authors' knowledge, PPR has not
been reported previously as a congenital infection or in combination with
pestiviral infection.

In this study, we evaluated immunohistochemically whether increased thickness of 
the colon subepithelial collagen layer in diabetic patients relates to
collagenous colitis. A total of 100 patients (25 in each group) were included in 
this study. There were diabetic patients with chronic diarrhea in the first
group, diabetic patients without chronic diarrhea in the second group,
non-diabetic patients with chronic diarrhea in the third group, and control
patients in the fourth group. The endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from 
the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon. The thickness of the
subepithelial collagen layer was measured using the ocular micrometer method. The
immunohistochemical staining was performed with type 1 collagen and fibronectin
antibody. The thickness of the colon subepithelial collagen layer in diabetic
patients with or without diarrhea was significantly greater than that in control 
patients. This thickened subepithelial collagen layer in diabetic patients was
stained with fibronectin antibody, but not with type 1 collagen antibody in the
immunohistochemical study. These immunohistochemical staining characteristics
were not similar to those in collagenous colitis, but were similar to those in
normal subjects. Increased colon subepithelial collagen layer thickness in
diabetic patients does not relate to collagenous colitis.

Diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology of palpable breast masses:
an SROC curve with fixed and random effects linear meta-regression models.

Turkey. matemel@baskent.edu.tr

We used various meta-analytic methods to compare 25 studies describing
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytologic analyses performed from 1984 to 2007 on
palpable breast masses. We found that in the 25 studies examined, the sensitivity
ranged from 78% to 100%, the specificity ranged from 76% to 100%, and the
diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) ranged from 15.83 to 33 198. The overall diagnostic
accuracy was found to be as follows: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92-0.94) for sensitivity,
0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.98) for specificity, and 505.209 (95% CI: 273.08-934.95) for
the DOR. The overall diagnostic accuracy according to the results of summary
receiving operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis was 0.95 +/- 0.0032, and
the overall weighted area under the (receiving operating characteristic [ROC])
curve (AUC) was 0.99 +/- 0.0014. The DOR values did not show a large variation in
the various positivity threshold values. However, the results of those studies
had some heterogeneity. The four covariates that were added to the standard SROC 
model to evaluate variations in the results of the studies were the year of
publication, the number of aspirations, the percentage of insufficient material, 
and the study design. The relative diagnostic accuracy of studies performed after
1990 was 3.98 times higher than that of studies performed before 1990. The
relative DOR (RDOR) value was also found to be statistically significant (95% CI:
1.22-13.02). That result may be attributed to the technologic improvements in
diagnostic tools over the years. Although it was not statistically significant,
an increase in the number of aspirations caused an increase in the RDOR of the
FNA cytology (95% CI: 0.52-8.11). In contrast, increasing the percent of
insufficient material caused a statistically insignificant but clinically
significant decrease in the RDOR of FNA (RDOR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.21-2.98). In
conclusion, our meta-analysis has shown that FNA cytologic analysis of palpable
breast masses is highly accurate in the diagnostic differentiation of benign from
malignant tumors.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of different clinical manifestations 
that are risk factors for atherothrombotic cardiovascular disorders.
Fatty-acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2), which is highly expressed in
adipocytes, specifically exerts intracellular lipid trafficking. A high level of 
fatty-acid-binding protein 4 expression present in obese subjects has also been
found in mice and humans, especially in macrophages at atherosclerotic lesions.
An in vivo study demonstrated that the inhibitor of aP2 would be a new
therapeutic agent for treating metabolic diseases in mice. We have investigated
the mRNA expression of fatty-acid-binding protein 4 in human epicardial adipose
and ascending aorta tissues of metabolic syndrome and nonmetabolic syndrome
patients.
METHODS: Paired epicardial adipose and ascending aorta tissue samples were
obtained from 10 metabolic syndrome patients and 4 nonmetabolic syndrome patients
during coronary bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement therapy,
respectively. Fatty-acid-binding protein 4 gene expression was determined by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Fatty-acid-binding protein 4 expression of epicardial
adipose tissue was significantly higher in metabolic syndrome patients than in
nonmetabolic syndrome controls (P<.05). In metabolic syndrome patients,
fatty-acid-binding protein 4 expression in epicardial adipose tissue was 66 times
higher than fatty-acid-binding protein 4 expression in ascending aorta tissue.
The expression level of fatty-acid-binding protein 4 in epicardial adipose tissue
was found to be significantly correlated with waist circumference in all subjects
(r=.535, P<.05). Our data showed for the first time that human epicardial adipose
and ascending aorta tissues express fatty-acid-binding protein 4 and that its
level of expression in epicardial adipose tissues of metabolic syndrome patients 
is elevated. Increased fatty-acid-binding protein 4 gene expression in epicardial
adipose tissues of metabolic syndrome patients led us think that
fatty-acid-binding protein 4 might be an important factor in metabolic syndrome.

The generation of urothelial carcinoma is caused by the accumulation of various
molecular changes, as in most malignancies. There are conflicting data about the 
status of HER-2/neu oncogene in urothelial carcinomas. The aim of this study was 
to determine the status of HER-2/neu oncogene in high-grade invasive urothelial
carcinoma of urinary bladder both in protein and DNA level. We evaluated
HER-2/neu protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene
amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time
quantitative PCR in paraffin-embedded samples of high-grade invasive urothelial
carcinoma obtained from 36 patients. Polysomy 17 was also assessed by FISH.
Immunohistochemically, HER-2/neu protein overexpression was observed in 22
(61.1%) tumors (ten tumors with score 3+ and 12 with score 2+). Fourteen of 36
tumors (38.9%) were evaluated as negative (score 0 or 1+). Complete concordance
between FISH and the PCR was seen in all of the samples scored as 0 and 1+ by
IHC. HER-2/neu gene amplification was observed in three of 27 (11.1%) tumors by
FISH (nine samples were non-informative) and in eight of 36 (22.2%) tumors by the
PCR. The complete concordance between HER2-2/neu protein overexpression and gene 
amplification was seen only in three of 27 tumors. Polysomy 17 was seen in nine
tumors (33.3%). The results indicated that, in contrast to breast cancer, there
was no strong association between HER-2/neu overexpression and gene amplification
in invasive urothelial carcinomas, and polysomy 17 was higher in tumors showing
HER-2/neu overexpression.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the significance of immunohistochemical
expression of Galectin-3 in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant
thyroid nodules. We studied the fine needle aspiration specimens of 38 patients
who had evaluated for nodular goiter and undergone a thyroid surgery between
2004-2005. Slides had been stained immunocytochemically with Galectin-3. The
cytoplasmic staining of Galectin-3 was analyzed. Three cases of five follicular
carcinomas had positive staining for Galectin-3, while two had not. Two cases
with follicular adenomas were negative for Galectin-3. Five cases of six
papillary carcinomas had positive staining for Galectin-3, while one case (the
case with a papillary microcarcinoma) had not. The single cases with medullary
and anaplastic carcinomas were negative for Galectin-3. None of the cases with a 
benign thyroid pathology had positive staining for Galectin-3. Galectin-3
immunocytochemical staining, had a sensitivity of 61.5%, specificity of 100%,
positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 83.3% for
thyroid malignancies. For the evaluation of follicular neoplasm, Galectin-3
immunocytochemical staining had a sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 100%,
positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 50%.
Galectin-3 expression in thyrocytes is a strong indicator of a malignant
proliferative lesion especially for papillary and to an extent in follicular
thyroid neoplasms. Galectin-3 could be used as a supplementary marker for
cytological diagnosis.

Turkey. ozum@cumhuriyet.edu.tr

Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors of paraganglionic tissue which are
extremely rare in the sellar area. We present a case of sellar paraganglioma with
parasellar and suprasellar extension in a 70-year-old man who presented with
headache. CT demonstrated sellar mass with suprasellar and right parasellar
extension. The lesion was removed subtotally via a trans-sphenoidal approach.
Histopathological diagnosis was paraganglioma. Differential diagnosis between
paragangliomas and unusual types of pituitary adenomas, especially null-cell
adenomas, is made by presence of cell nests (Zellballen) in paraganglioma, lack
of immunopositivity for pituitary hormones, cytoplasmic immunopositivity for
chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase, and immunonegativity for cytokeratin 
19, cytokeratin 20 and endomysial antibody. In the case of a mass in the sellar
region, paraganglioma, although rare, should be included in the differential
diagnosis.

Lead, widely used in industry, is a great environmental health problem. Many
studies have examined its effects on the health of both humans and animals.
Experimental studies have shown that sulphur-containing antioxidants have
beneficial effects against the detrimental properties of lead. The present study 
was designed to investigate markers of oxidative stress (hemoglobin (Hb) in whole
blood, malondialdehyde (MDA) in sera; superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and
glutathione peroxidise (GSH-Px) in erythrocyte hemolysate and vitamins A and E in
plasma) in rats given lead (2000ppm) with or without sulphur-containing
antioxidants (l-methionine (Met) (100mg/kg/day), N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
(800mg/kg/day), l-homocysteine (Hcy) (25mg/kg/day), lipoic acid (LA)
(50mg/kg/day)) in their water for 5 weeks. In the lead group, Hb and plasma
vitamin E levels were significantly lower whereas MDA levels were significantly
higher compared to controls (p<0.05). Hb levels in lead-methionine and lead-LA
groups were significantly higher than the lead group (p<0.01). MDA levels were
reduced in all groups compared to the lead group (p<0.01). There was a decrease
below control values in erythrocyte SOD (p<0.01) and GSH-Px (p<0.05) levels in
the lead-LA group. Plasma vitamin A levels were significantly high in
lead-methionine group compared to lead group (p<0.01). In conclusion, the data
suggests that oxidative stress induced by lead is reduced by sulphur-containing
compounds.

Multiple hydatid cystectomy of the heart necessitating LIMA to LAD anastomosis in
a young patient.

Cardiac hydatid disease is very rare, even in endemic regions. Clinical
manifestations included chest pain, anaphylactic shock, constrictive
pericarditis, congestive heart failure, and arterial embolism. Surgery is the
exclusive therapy, where the cysts are excised during open-heart surgery. The
surgical approach therefore must be performed carefully, given the potential
complications that surgery may bring. Because of the risk of potentially lethal
complications, early diagnosis and definitive treatment are important. A
32-year-old male patient was admitted with chest pain, weight loss, lethargy, and
dizziness. On the transesophageal echocardiography study, a cystic mass (2.5 x 3 
x 4.5 cm in dimension adjacent to the left ventricular posterior wall) that was
divided into two by a septum was noted. Diagnosis of hydatidosis was confirmed
with serologic tests (ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence). Echinococcosis,
also known as hydatid disease, is common in several regions of the world, for
example, the Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, South America, and East
Africa. While performing pericystectomy in the anterior left ventricular wall, we
noticed that there were three cysts, contrary to the preoperative diagnosis
pointing a single one, and it was impossible to effectively complete the
procedure without compromising anterosuperiorly displaced left anterior
descending artery (LAD). We decided to go on bypass, arrest the heart, and
complete the pericystectomy at the cost of injuring LAD and grafting the left
internal mammary artery to LAD. Microscopic examination of the cyst showed a
germinal layer and an avascular, eosinophilic, chitinous layer that confirmed the
diagnosis of hydatid cyst. The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative 
day on albendazole medication.

Although histologic grading of meningiomas has prognostic and clinical
implications, it is difficult in some cases to predict the outcome of patients.
There have been several efforts to evaluate the use of different
immunohistochemical markers for predicting meningioma prognosis. We analyzed the 
immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, p53, p21, p16, and PTEN proteins in 130 
meningiomas (64 benign, 39 atypical, and 27 malignant meningiomas) using tissue
microarray. The tumors were graded according to the World Health Organization
classification. There was a statistically significant correlation between the
expression of Ki-67, p53, p21, p16, and the grade of meningiomas (p0.001). By
ordinal logistic regression, p53 and Ki-67 were significantly associated with
grade, and an increase of 1% in the labeling index of these markers resulted in
an increase in the risk of raising the grade by 2.17 and 1.49, respectively.
Histological grade, p53, Ki-67 labeling indices, and overexpression of p16 were
strongly associated with decreased event-free survival in univariate analysis. In
contrast, multivariate analysis revealed that only tumor grade is an independent 
factor for predicting meningioma recurrence. We conclude that the Ki-67 and p53
labeling indices are useful additional tools in discriminating atypical from
benign or anaplastic meningiomas, especially in histological borderline cases.

Transient myeloproliferative disorder is a self limiting disorder characterized
by leukocytosis with the presence of megakaryoblasts in the peripheral blood and 
bone marrow, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organomegaly. It occurs in
approximately 10% of newborn infants with Down syndrome. Hepatic fibrosis is seen
in the severe form of transient myeloproliferative disorder with Down syndrome
that is characterized by diffuse intralobular sinusoidal fibrosis and
extramedullary hematopoesis. We describe a patient with hydrops fetalis, Down
syndrome, and transient myeloproliferative disorder. We suggest that patients
with the severe form of transient myeloproliferative disorder should be examined 
for hepatic fibrosis.

The present study was conducted to investigate the sensitivity, specificity,
predictive values and accuracy of serum MIF, CEA, CA 19-9 levels and their
various combinations in patients with gastric cancer. Study group consists of
pathologically verified, gastric cancer (n = 63) and apparently healthy controls 
(n = 50). Serum MIF concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Serum values of patients were significantly higher than the
controls (p = 0.011). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, predictive values
and accuracies were calculated for each marker and their various combinations.
The best results were achieved with the marker combination of MIF-CEA-CA 19-9 and
MIF-CEA combination. In our opinion, the combination of the markers MIF-CEA is a 
valuable diagnostic tool for gastric cancer.

Maspin overexpression correlates with increased expression of vascular
endothelial growth factors A, C, and D in human ovarian carcinoma.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, including VEGFA, VEGFC, and
VEGFD, plays an essential role in the angiogenesis of both pathologic and
nonpathologic conditions. Maspin belongs to the serpin superfamily and has been
identified as a tumor suppressor because it inhibits motility, invasion, and
angiogenesis. Few studies have compared maspin with VEGF in ovarian carcinoma.
Therefore, we investigated the expression and correlation of maspin, VEGFA,
VEGFC, and VEGFD with the tumorigenesis of the ovary and clinicopathologic
variables. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined maspin, VEGFA, VEGFC, and
VEGFD expression in 60 ovarian carcinoma tissues (35 serous papillary carcinomas,
18 endometrioid carcinomas, and 7 primary ovarian mucinous carcinomas). Staining 
of cells was scored as +2 if more than 50% of the cells were positive, as +1 if
less than 50% of the cells were positive, and as negative if none of the cells
stained positive. Overexpression of maspin, VEGFC, and VEGFD was significantly
associated with high tumor grade (P<.001, P=.004, P<.001, respectively), clinical
stage (P=.002, .01, and .001, respectively), the presence of ascites (P<.001,
P=.03, and P=.001, respectively), and the presence of metastatic lymph nodes
(P=.002, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). Maspin was correlated with VEGFA
(P=.01), VEGFC (P<.001), and VEGFD (P<.001). The VEGFA score was positively
correlated with high tumor grade (P=.04), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)
(P<.001), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage
(P=.009), maspin, VEGFC (P=.003), and VEGFD (P=.003), but it was not correlated
with the presence of ascites and metastatic lymph nodes. Maspin, VEGFC, and VEGFD
are expressed in ovarian tumors with a poor prognostic parameters, and seem to
play a role in ovarian cancer angiogenesis, progression, and lymph node
metastases. Our results indicate that in contrast to most other carcinomas,
maspin expression is directly associated with the biological aggressiveness of
ovarian carcinoma. These results may offer new insights regarding the role of
maspin in ovarian cancer and might also affect the diagnosis and treatment
strategies.

The aims of this study were twofold: (i) to determine the occurrence frequency of
apocrine carcinoma of the breast (ApBCa) in Turkish breast cancer (BCa) patients;
and (ii) to evaluate the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), gross cystic disease protein-15
(GCDFP-15), c-erbB-2, and p53 in these cases. Six hundred and twenty-six cases of
BCa were studied immunohistochemically (streptoavidin-biotin horseradish
peroxidase method). The results of ApBCa were compared with those of invasive
ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified type (IDC-NOS) cases of similar grade.
Thirteen cases of ApBCa were encountered, accounting for 2.1% of all BCa cases.
Immunohistochemically, ApBCa positivity was as follows: GCDFP-15 (100%), ER
(39%), PR (8%), AR (54%), p53 (39%), and c-erbB-2 (85%). In the IDC-NOS group,
GCDFP-15* was expressed in less than 50% of the tumors. The occurrence
frequencies of the other markers were as follows: ER (69%), PR (69%)*, AR (46%), 
c-erbB-2 (0%)*, and p53 (31%), (*) indicating significant differences between the
two groups. For Turkish BCa patients, (i) the occurrence rate of ApBCa (2.1%) was
high; and (ii) the following combination would allow for an immunohistochemical
identification of ApBCa: GCDFP-15(+), c-erbB-2(+), and PR(-).

The mutations of c-kit gene, which encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine
kinase (CD117-KIT) or activation of CD117, lead to the activation of signal
transduction cascades regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, and
adhesion. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD117 in
normal, inflammatory, neoplastic, and reactive lesions of the thyroid. Using
polyclonal anti-CD117 antibody, we performed immunohistochemical staining on
tissue blocks from 230 cases obtained from the archives of the Department of
Pathology, Ondokuz Mayis University (Samsun, Turkey), collected between 1990 and 
2006. Each slide was evaluated for extent and intensity of staining. Staining
extent was expressed as the percentage of stained cells. Staining of <10% of the 
cells was accepted as negative. Staining intensity was evaluated only in positive
cases. By addition of the extent and intensity scores, the combined score was
calculated. In our study, the combined CD117 staining scores of neoplastic and
inflammatory groups were found to be higher than the reactive and normal groups. 
Within the neoplastic group, papillary carcinomas differed from follicular
adenomas significantly, although papillary carcinomas showed no statistically
significant difference compared to follicular carcinomas. Immunohistochemical
CD117 positivity was detected in a wide range of neoplastic and inflammatory
thyroid diseases. The neoplastic group and, within them, the papillary carcinomas
showed a higher ratio of CD117 positivity. Although our results need to be
confirmed by other molecular and genetic studies, the high rate of positivity in 
papillary carcinomas was one of the striking findings, which may result in novel 
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Neoplasms of the breast containing multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) 
include both benign and malignant entities, such as benign soft tissue giant cell
tumors, atypical fibrous histiocytoma, sarcomas, metaplastic carcinomas and the
uncommon carcinomas containing osteoclast-like giant cells (OGC). Breast
carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous features (BCCF) is a distinct variant of
breast cancer.
CASES: We report the cytologic features, pathologic findings and
immunohistochemical profile in 2 cases of this unusual variant of breast
carcinoma. Two women aged 53 and 50 years women presented with a history of left 
and right breast lump but no local lymphadenopathy, respectively. Fine needle
aspiration cytology (FNAC) of both cases revealed abundant MGC with highly
pleomorphic tumor cells in the hemorrhagic necrotic background. Both of the cases
were histopathologically diagnosed as BCCF.
CONCLUSION: Choriocarcinomatous differentiation with multinucleated
syncytiotrophoblast-like giant cells is extremely rare in breast tumors. Although
rare, FNAC of breast cancer with pleomorphic MGC requires careful search for
differential diagnosis; breast carcinoma with giant cell features
(choriocarcinomatous features, OGC features) must be differentiated from
metastatic tumors and other breast lesions containing giant cells.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) material from 37
cases of breast glycogen-rich clear cell cancer (GRCC) and correlate
cytomorphologic features with histologic appearance to determine characteristics 
of GRCC on FNAC.
STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed cytologic features of 37 cases of breast GRCC from the 
archives of Ege University Hospital diagnosed between 1994 and 2006.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with available aspirate and confirmed GRCC were
identified. The female patients ranged from 32 to 81 years (mean 52 years). The
initial cytologic diagnoses were adenocarcinoma for 27 and atypical or suspicious
for cancer for 10. The cytologic picture was characterized by hypercellular tumor
cells in loosely cohesive syncytial groups and some single cells. Most tumor
cells had abundant, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm or foamy to clear
cytoplasm with well-defined cytoplasmic membranes and moderate to marked nuclear 
pleomorphism with prominent nucleoli. Histologic examination confirmed all cases 
to be pure GRCC.
CONCLUSION: Breast GRCC is a rare, distinct category with cytologic features that
overlap considerably with those of other carcinomas. Awareness of variability in 
cytomorphologic appearance of GRCC and routine assessment for glycogen facilitate
accurate diagnosis of these lesions by FNAC and enable prompt treatment of these 
poor-prognosis breast cancers.

We report two cases of thyroidal plasma cell granuloma. Both patients underwent
surgical resection after presenting with painless neck swelling. Histopathologic 
examination of the specimens revealed plasmacytes infiltrating the thyroid
parenchyma and immunohistochemical studies showed the polyclonal nature of the
plasma cells. Plasma cell granuloma is a benign lesion and its appearance in the 
thyroid gland is extremely rare. Eleven prior cases with thyroid localization
have been reported to date in the English literature. Nine of the plasma cell
granuloma cases occurred in women, four in men (including the present cases). The
clinicopathologic features and diagnostic difficulties of this rare entity are
described, and its relation to inflammatory pseudotumor of other sites is
discussed with a review of the literature.

Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is a relatively rare form of acute leukemia that 
has heterogeneous blast morphology and karyotypic abnormalities. An 8-month-old
boy with a retroperitoneal mass was diagnosed as having acute megakaryoblastic
leukemia that initially presented as small round cell tumor of childhood. Bone
marrow aspiration showed syncytial groups of atypical medium sized cells with
scant cytoplasm and fine nuclear chromatin. Retroperitoneal mass biopsy showed
several lymph nodes with cohesive clusters of neoplastic cells that demonstrated 
expression of Factor VIII. Flow cytometric analysis of the second bone marrow
aspiration showed CD 61 positivity. Karyotypic analysis of bone marrow cells
showed a novel translocation, (1;5)(q21;p13).

The analysis of hormones and enzymes extracted from endocrine glands of the neck 
region in deaths due to hanging.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Forensic Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.

Our study was designed to determine whether the hormone and enzyme levels that we
have mentioned in serum specimens can be used in postmortem examinations of the
cases of hanging or not. Our research includes the postmortem results of the
thyroid tissue pathologic examinations, serum levels of triiodothyronine (fT3),
thyroxine (fT4), thyrotropin (TSH), thyroglobulin, parathormone (PTH),
calcitonin, and amylase in cases of death due to hanging. The mean of fT3 and
thyroglobulin levels were higher in hanging cases than those of sudden death
cases. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In our study, we
obtained data demonstrating that high postmortem levels of free T3 and
thyroglobulin may be indicators of vital reaction in hanging cases. In such cases
of death, it seems that applying pressure on the neck region where the thyroid
gland is located causes the leakage of thyroglobulin as well as fT3, the active
form of the thyroid hormone.

Non-pustular palmoplantar psoriasis: is histologic differentiation from
eczematous dermatitis possible?

Aydin O(1), Engin B, Oğuz O, Ilvan S, Demirkesen C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Istanbul University, Cerrahpasxa Medical Faculty,
Istanbul, Turkey.

The differential diagnosis of psoriasis affecting palmoplantar skin might be
troublesome because of the anatomic properties of this region. Both palmoplantar 
psoriasis and eczematous dermatitis of this skin area share similar histologic
features. The punch biopsies from 17 patients with psoriasis and 25 with
eczematous dermatitis were evaluated, blind to the clinical diagnosis. Vertically
situated multiple foci of parakeratosis, alternating with orthokeratosis,were the
only statistically significant feature in the differential diagnosis of
palmoplantar psoriasis [76.5% (13/17), p = 0.005]. In contrast,multiple foci of
parakeratosis [70.6% (12/17)], loss of granular layer at least in focal areas
[41.2% (7/17)], presence of neutrophils at the summits of parakeratosis [4%
(1/17)], presence of neutrophils and/or plasma in the parakeratotic foci [94.1%
(16/17) and 11.8% (2/17)],psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia [88.2% (15/17)],
spongiosis restricted to the lower parts of the epidermis [47.1%
(8/17)],dyskeratotic cells [82.4% (14/17)], thinning of suprapapillary
plate[58.8% (10/17)], edema of the papillary dermis [29.4% (5/17)],presence of
tortous and dilated capillaries in the papillary dermis[52.9% (9/17) and 76.5%
(13/17)] and extravasated erythrocytes[29.4% (5/17)] were found to be more common
in palmoplantar psoriasis compared with eczematous dermatitis; but none of them
was statistically significant. Interestingly, spongiotic vesicles were seen in
most of the patients with psoriasis [76.5% (13/17)]. In conclusion,according to
our findings, many features of palmoplantar psoriasis overlapped with those of
eczematous dermatitis. However, detection of multiple parakeratotic foci, placed 
vertically, alternating with orthohyperkeratosis, could be considered in favor of
palmoplantar psoriasis.

Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) are epithelial neoplasms which show a distinct
geographical distribution and have a characteristic histology. These tumors have 
multifactorial etiology, including virological, environmental, and genetic
components. The aim of the present study is to assess the relation between
Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) and subtypes of NPC in Aegean Turkish patients. In the
present study, nasopharyngeal biopsies of 84 cases diagnosed as nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, between 1998 and 2004, were reevaluated. In situ hybridization with
the fluorescein-conjugated EBV-encoded small nuclear RNA (EBER) oligonucleotide
probe was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using an automated slide
stainer system. Of 84 patients, 55 were men and 29 were women with ages ranging
between 7 and 77 years (median 50, mean 46.73). Seventy-three of 84 cases were
EBER positive. All of 62 cases (100.0%) with undifferentiated carcinoma, 8 of 16 
(50.0%) with differentiated nonkeratinizing carcinoma, and three of six (50.0%)
with keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma were EBV positive. EBER positivity was 
statistically significantly higher in undifferentiated carcinomas, compared to
the other morphological subtypes (p = 0.000). Our results showed that all
morphological subtypes of NPC are highly associated with EBV latent infection in 
our region, and a higher prevalence was found for the undifferentiated subtype.

Fascin expression [corrected] in glial tumors and its prognostic significance in 
glioblastomas.

Gunal A(1), Onguru O, Safali M, Beyzadeoglu M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey.

Fascin is a -55 kDa-actin binding protein. Actin bundles rearranged by fascin
proteins are concentrated in cell membrane protrusions and these protrusions
provide motility of the cell. In this study, we evaluated fascin expression in
glial tumors and its relation with histologic grade. Its prognostic value in
glioblastomas (GBs) was also investigated. Seventy-six glial tumors including 44 
glioblastomas with known survival time, 18 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs), six
diffuse astrocytomas (DAs), and eight pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) were examined 
immunohistochemically for fascin expression. Fascin was observed in the neurons
of normal brain tissue and endothelium of vascular spaces in the glial tumors.
Fascin expression was correlated with histologic grade in DAs. PAs expressed low 
levels of fascin. Half of the GBs showed high levels of fascin expression. In the
GB group, overall survival was poor for cases with percentage of stained cells
>50% having moderate or strong staining intensity. In GBs, overall survival was
also poor for >50-year-old cases and cases that refused radiotherapy.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age (>50 years, P=0.021) and
higher level of fascin expression (immunohistochemical score >8, P=0.040) were
independent poor prognostic factors. In conclusion, fascin expression levels are 
correlated with histologic grade and fascin overexpression may play an important 
role in the biologic behavior of glial astrocytic tumors and in the prognosis of 
GBs.

Pleomorphic adenoma of the nasal columella.

Ceylan A(1), Celenk F, Poyraz A, Uslu S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey.

Pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor) is the most common benign neoplasm of the
salivary glands. It is considered to occur primarily in the major salivary
glands, such as the parotid and submandibular glands. It is much less common in
the minor salivary glands, and rarely occurs at other sites, such as larynx,
pharynx, trachea, lacrimal gland, and sinonasal tract. An external nose
localization of this lesion is very rare. Irrespective of the site where the
lesion originates, its preferred treatment should be surgery. We describe a very 
rare case of recurrent pleomorphic adenoma originating from the columella.

Author information:

Turkey.

AIMS: The aim of the present study was to find the most efficient sampling
strategy for stereological analysis of peripheral nerve, including the number of 
myelinated nerve fibres, axon cross-sectional area and myelin sheet thicknesses
of nerve fibres.
METHODS: Two groups of rats underwent experimental resection of the tibial and
peroneal nerves. The first group received tibial-peroneal end to end autograft
repair (n = 6). Tibial and peroneal nerves were isolated, transected, and
separated 1 cm distal to the trifurcation, where they lay adjacent to each other 
by a 1-cm gap, then repaired with an autologous nerve graft taken from the tibial
nerve. The proximal stump of the tibial nerve and distal stump of the peroneal
nerve were connected to each other by means of the nerve graft. The second group 
received tibial-peroneal repair with a flexible collagen tube (n = 6). After 90
days of recovery, animals were sacrificed and nerve segments were removed and
sectioned for microscopy. Three different sampling strategies, that is, small,
medium and large step sizes were applied to obtain each quantitative parameter.
RESULTS: There are no significant differences between these sampling strategies
with respect to total number of myelinated nerve fibres, axon cross-sectional
area and myelin sheet thicknesses of nerve fibres.
CONCLUSION: Findings show that one can achieve the desired estimate precisely
with a rather large and less time-consuming sampling approach. In addition, it
was observed that the size discrepancy of nerve regeneration can be improved by
collagen tube conduit even with a 1-cm gap.

Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a complication associated with preterm
birth. Because most neonatal death, morbidity, and cost are linked to preterm
birth, understanding the mechanisms for developing preterm PROM (pPROM) is
critical. The aim of this study is to investigate whether telomerase activity of 
the chorionic trophoblasts may play a role in the pathogenesis of PROM. Placental
membranes were collected from 56 patients with pPROM and 45 patients with preterm
labor (PTL). Telomerase activity was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and
telomerase activity index (TAI) was calculated for both groups. Results are
expressed as the mean +/- standard deviation. Differences between groups were
analyzed using an independent-samples t-test. To evaluate other suggested
mechanisms, such as apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation,
immunohistochemistry for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3, and M30 CytoDEATH antibodies were also performed. The
TAI was found to be 6.8 +/- 3.2 for PTL, while it was 2.5 +/- 1.5 for pPROM.
Decreased TAI was statistically significant in pPROM membranes in comparison with
PTL (P < 0.001). Number of apoptotic trophoblasts was significantly increased for
the membranes of pPROM (P < 0.001), whereas strong staining of MMP-9 and TIMP-3
was found for chorionic trophoblasts as well as for other cells in both groups.
Although study of the pPROM has focused on activation of matrix
metalloproteinases and apoptosis that result in the consequence of a programmed
membrane weakening process, decreased telomerase activity of chorionic
trophoblasts is likely to have a contributing role in the pathogenesis of pPROM
as well.

Tularemia outbreaks have occurred in various regions of Turkey in recent years.
In this study, clinical (145 patients) and laboratory (97 patients) features of
patients with oropharyngeal tularemia were evaluated during the tularemia
outbreak in the district of Gölcük in Kocaeli, Turkey. We analyzed the risk
factors for therapeutic failure and prolonged recovery time, and compared the
efficacy of three antibiotic groups, namely aminoglycoside, tetracycline and
quinolone. The most common physical sign and laboratory findings in patients were
lymphadenopathy (LAP) and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, respectively.
Treatment failure was observed in 55 of the 145 (38%) patients during one-year
follow-up and the most successful results were obtained in the quinolone group.
It was determined that antimicrobial therapy initiated 14 days after onset of
symptoms was a statistically significiant risk factor, reducing the success rate 
(p=0.0001, OR=13.10, 95% CI=5.69-30.15) and prolonging the recovery period
(p=0.001, OR=3.23, 95% CI=1.63-6.40) in oropharyngeal tularemia cases. These
results suggest that antimicrobial treatment should be started early, and
quinolones such as moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin seem to be new alternatives in 
the treatment of oropharyngeal tularemia.

BACKGROUND: Cytokines were thought to play an important role for the expansion of
odontogenic cysts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cytokine and
chemokine levels of radicular and residual cyst fluids.
METHODS: Cyst fluids were aspirated from 21 patients (11 radicular and 10
residual cysts) and the levels of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and regulated
upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were determined by 
ELISA using commercially available kits.
RESULTS: Both radicular and residual cyst fluids contained IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, 
MCP-1, and RANTES, concentrations of which were significantly higher in the
radicular cyst fluids than those in the residual cysts (P < 0.001 for IL-1alpha, 
TNF-alpha, and RANTES; P < 0.01 for MCP-1). Compared to the other mediators, the 
concentration of IL-1alpha was found to be highest in both of the cyst fluids. In
addition, positive correlations were found between IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, MCP-1,
and RANTES in radicular and residual cyst fluids.
CONCLUSION: If the radicular cyst is inadvertently left behind following tooth
extraction, some degree of inflammation may carry on. Residual cysts, although to
a lesser extend than radicular cysts, have the potential to expand.

Clusterin is a circulating multifunctional glycoprotein produced in several kinds
of epithelial and neuronal cells. Clusterin is upregulated during different
physiological and pathological states, such as senescence, type-2 diabetes
mellitus, Alzheimer disease, and in various neoplasms. Herein, we investigated
the immunohistochemical expression of clusterin in non-neoplastic adenohypophysis
of human autopsy subjects and pituitary adenomas. We also investigated the
association of clusterin increase with age in adenohypophysis of autopsy
subjects. Immunohistochemically, clusterin was found positive in the cytoplasm of
all adenoma cases, and in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells, stellate cells,
mixed cell follicles and in colloidal material inside of the follicles of
non-neoplastic adenohypophysis as well. Clusterin expression in pituitary
adenomas was found significantly higher than in non-neoplastic adenohypophyses.
In addition, in non-neoplastic adenohypophysis, a significant increase in
clusterin expression levels between young (<or=30 years), middle aged (31 to 60
years), and older (>or=61 years) subjects (p < 0.00001, analysis of variance
[ANOVA]) was found. In addition to clusterin accumulation, presence of
calcification (p < 0.045, ANOVA) and presence of large follicles with colloid
accumulation (p < 0.004, ANOVA) were also statistically significant factors
related to aging in non-neoplastic adenohypophysis. In conclusion, the present
study demonstrated that clusterin expression was found in non-neoplastic
adenohypophysis and in upregulated amounts in pituitary adenomas. This study also
demonstrated that in non-neoplastic adenohypophyses, increase of clusterin
positive cells; histopathological findings of calcification or presence colloidal
material accumulation in large follicles were associated with age. To our
knowledge, immunohistochemical localization of clusterin in pituitary adenomas
was not reported previously.

Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
immunodeficiency and partial albinism. Asymmetric crying facies (ACF) is caused
by congenital hypoplasia or agenesis of the depressor anguli oris muscle.
Asymmetric crying facies may be isolated or it may be associated with various
anomalies. We report a 3-month-old Turkish boy who had clinical and microscopic
hair features of GS associated with ACF. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the 1st case of this association to be reported in the literature.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the treatment efficiency of
intra-rectal (IR) and intra-peritoneal (IP) application of Origanum onites
essential oil (OOEO), which is a well-known antioxidant, in the colitis model
induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol (E) in
comparison with dexamethasone therapy through the morphologic damage score.
Monoclonal antibodies against intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54),
anti-rat granulocytes, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), were also investigated
immunohistochemically. There was a significant difference in terms of ulceration,
mucus cell depletion, inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular dilatation
(p<0.001), crypt abscesses (p<0.01), and edema (p<0.05) between OOEO-1mg/kg-IR
and control colitis groups. A significant difference was encountered in terms of 
mucus cell depletion, crypt abscesses, inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular
dilatation (p<0.01), and ulceration (p<0.05) between the OOEO-0.1mg/kg-IR and
control colitis groups. A significant difference was noticed in terms of
ulceration, inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus cell depletion (p<0.001),
vascular dilatation (p<0.01), and mucosal atrophy (p<0.05) between the
OOEO-1mg/kg-IP and control colitis groups. There was a significant difference in 
terms of ulceration, mucus cell depletion, inflammatory cell infiltration
(p<0.001), crypt abscesses, vascular dilatation (p<0.01), and mucosal atrophy
(p<0.05) between the OOEO-0.1mg/kg-IP and control colitis groups. No significant 
difference was determined in terms of ulceration, inflammatory cyst, mucosal
atrophy, edema, and vascular dilatation between the dexamethazone and control
colitis groups (p>0.05). Under the present conditions, we concluded that IR and
IP OOEO treatment, applied at the dosage of 0.1 or 1mg/kg/day, have a significant
protective effect on the colonic injury.

We describe a case of non-functioning pituitary adenoma in a 35-year-old woman
with a prior history of fertility problems. The patient had received clomiphen
citrate and human chorionic gonadotrophin for 3 years. Histological examination
of the tumor revealed signet ring-like cell areas admixed with minor conventional
round-polygonal neoplastic cells. The two populations of tumor cells showed
strong immunoreactivity for chromogranin and synaptophysin. The clinicopathologic
features and diagnostic difficulties of this rare entity are discussed.

This immunohistochemical study was carried out to evaluate the role of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and
MMP-9), their inhibitor (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, TIMP-1), and
microvessel density (MVD) in the clinicopathologic behavior of childhood
Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Paraffin-embedded histologic sections from 15 children
with HL were immunohistochemically stained with MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, VEGF, and
CD31 antibodies to investigate the correlation between the expression of these
markers and the clinicopathologic characteristics of HL. Expression of MMP-2 and 
VEGF in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS) was more frequent in nodular
sclerosis than in other subtypes (p=0.07 and 0.08, respectively). None of the
study parameters in HRS cell were associated with age, sex, disease stage,
extranodal disease, and the occurrence of bulky tumor. There was a trend toward
advanced stage in negative TIMP-1 staining in HRS cells (p=0.06). In reactive
lymphocytes, MMP-2 expression was correlated with MVD (r=0.68, p=0.005), and
MMP-9 expression was correlated with B symptoms (p=0.003). Also, low TIMP-1
expression in reactive lymphocytes was frequently found in patients with advanced
stage (p=0.048). There was a positive correlation with the ratio of MMP-2
expression in reactive lymphocytes and MVD (r=0.68, p=0.005). Expression of MMP-9
in reactive lymphocytes was correlated with MVD without statistical significance 
(r=0.487, p=0.06). Our results suggest that, as in many solid tumors,
angiogenesis and angiogenic factors may play an important role in childhood HL.
Larger series of patients are needed to determine the prognostic value of
angiogenesis in childhood HL.

Are there any differences in the expression of hormonal receptors and
proliferation markers between uterine and extrauterine leiomyomas?

Denizli, Turkey.

The aim of this study is to determine the immunohistochemical expressions of
estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 proliferation marker in 8
extrauterine leiomyomas and to compare these values with their uterine
counterparts. In all, 8 patients with extrauterine leiomyomas and 20 patients
with uterine leiomyomas as a control group were studied. Sections were
immunohistochemically stained with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and 
Ki-67 antibodies. Labeling indices for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, 
and Ki-67 were found to be 33.05%+/-31.70%, 14.18%+/-18.80%, and 0.52%+/-1.32%
for extrauterine leiomyomas and 65.09%+/-26.65%, 32.53%+/-32.80%, and
0.37%+/-0.71% for uterine leiomyomas, respectively. The difference of labeling
indices for progesterone receptor between uterine leiomyomas and extrauterine
leiomyomas was statistically significant (P=.002). This study shows that
increased expression of progesterone receptor is observed only in uterine
leiomyomas during the reproductive period. However, it seems that additional
factors to hormone receptors contribute to the development of extrauterine
leiomyomas.

BACKGROUND: The histologic features of tuberculin skin test site is not uniform. 
It may be related to status of tuberculosis.
METHODS: Forty-eight purified protein derivative (PPD) positive-cases were chosen
for the study. Thirty of the subjects had active tuberculosis. As previously
reported, the histologic pattern of inflammatory reaction seen in the test site
classified into three type: (a) Perivascular (PV)-type, (b) Basal spongiotic
dermatitis (BSD)-type and (c) Erythema multiforme (EM)-type. The frequencies of
histological patterns in active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis were
statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: In active tuberculosis group including 30 patient, 17 (56.7%) EM-type, 9
(30%) BSD-type and 4(13.3%) PV-type inflammation were seen. Among 18 latent
tuberculosis, there were 2 (11.1%) EM-type, 7 (38 8%) BSD-type and 9 (50%)
PV-type inflammatory reactions. The EM-type inflammation was more common in
active tuberculosis group. Bulla formation was seen in seven subjects with active
tuberculosis.
CONCLUSION: The histological pattern of PPD reaction site may be an important
sign reflecting the nature of the tuberculosis, which may be either latent or
active. The bulla formation is an important sign for active pulmonary
tuberculosis. Further, detailed immunohistopathologic studies of PPD reaction
with large number of cases may give important clues about tuberculosis
immunology.

Alveolar adenoma of the lung. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric
characteristics of two new cases and a review of the literature.

Sak SD(1), Koseoglu RD, Demirag F, Akbulut H, Gungor A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical School of Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.

Alveolar adenoma is a rare and benign tumour of the lung that usually presents in
asymptomatic patients as a coin lesion on chest radiography. Only 25 cases have
been reported in the English medical literature. Alveolar adenoma has a
characteristic multicystic histology and often resembles the normal lung
parenchyma. Ultrastructural studies indicate that the epithelial cells lining the
cysts are type-II pneumocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis may aid in the
characterization of alveolar adenoma and discriminate this condition from other
types of benign lesions of the lung. An indolent clinical progression and absence
of recurrence and metastasis after complete resection are the most important
characteristics indicative of the benign nature of alveolar adenoma. Few studies 
have been conducted at the molecular level, such as by flow cytometry, with the
objective of characterizing the biological nature of alveolar adenoma.
Differential diagnoses include sclerosing hemangioma, papillary adenoma,
lymphangioma, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. 
In this article we describe the immunohistochemical and flow cytometric features 
of this neoplasm in two male patients. Both the tumours showed a diploid DNA
pattern with a low proliferation index. p53 test was found to be negative, and
post-operative follow-up examinations at 22 and 32 months proved uneventful.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), the key enzyme that catalyzes the first steps in the
biosynthesis of the prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, appears to play a role 
in the regulation of progression, invasiveness and angiogenesis of various
neoplasms. We analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of Cox-2 and angiogenic
parameters (microvessel density (MVD) and vascular patterns) in 54 glioblastomas.
We also examined their relation with prognosis. Cox-2 immunohistochemical
expression was observed in 48 tumors (89%). There was no staining in six tumors
(11%). On univariate analysis, MVD was correlated with a poor outcome (MVD > 70; 
hazard ratio, 0.441; 95% confidence interval, 0.200-0.975, P = 0.041). But MVD
showed no prognostic impact on multivariate analysis. Neither Cox-2 expression
nor vascular pattern showed prognostic value. The difference in Cox-2 expression 
between the classical and bizarre vascular pattern in glioblastomas was
statistically significant (P = 0.047). However, no correlation was found between 
Cox-2 expression and MVD. These findings suggest that Cox-2 is heterogeneously
expressed in glioblastomas without a significant association with MVD. However,
Cox-2 expression may be related to vascular pattern in glioblastomas.

Alveolar airspace and pulmonary artery involvement by extramedullary
hematopoiesis: a unique manifestation of myelofibrosis.

Pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis is a rare manifestation of myelofibrosis. 
We encountered a unique case of pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis occurring 
in a 59-year-old white man, where in addition to the typical foci of interstitial
hematopoietic cells, a surgical lung biopsy showed airspace and arterial wall
involvement. Airspace foci were associated with acute and organizing alveolar
hemorrhage, while within arteries the hematopoietic elements had a striking
predilection for the vascular intima. The hematopoietic foci included erythroid
precursors, myeloid precursors, and megakaryocytes, which were immunoreactive
with hemoglobin, myeloperoxidase, and CD61, respectively. Whether extramedullary 
hematopoiesis represents in situ embryonic stem cell differentiation or a
compensatory seeding of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow remains to be
elucidated. However, familiarity with these findings in the lung could be helpful
in uncovering occult hematological disorders accompanied by extramedullary
hematopoiesis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis should also be considered as a cause 
of pulmonary hemorrhage, especially in the setting of myelofibrosis.

Expression of the TRAIL receptors in blood mononuclear cells in leukemia.

Deligezer U(1), Dalay N.

Author information:

Istanbul, Turkey.

TRAIL receptors are differentially expressed on restricted subpopulations of
normal blood cells. In the present study, we investigated the utility of
individual TRAIL receptors in evaluating the presence of circulating tumor cells 
in blood. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) carrying the t(9;22)
translocation were compared with patients in whom no translocation was detected, 
with patients with multiple myeloma and with a group of healthy individuals.
TRAIL receptor expression was analyzed by RT-PCR in blood mononuclear cells.
Blood mononuclear cells of healthy subjects expressed the TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2
death receptors and the TRAIL-R4 decoy receptor while the other decoy receptor
TRAIL-R3 was not detectable. This normal expression pattern was also observed in 
all cases with multiple myeloma and in almost all patients without translocation 
(42/43; 97.7%). However, in 24/56 (42.9%) of the translocation-positive patients,
the expression pattern was completely different. In this group the TRAIL-R4
receptor alone or in combination with TRAIL-R1 disappeared from blood mononuclear
cells, while the TRAIL-R2 was expressed at normal level, indicating that the loss
of expression is specific for the TRAIL-R4 and TRAIL-R1. This expression pattern 
was also confirmed by real-time PCR. The differences between the
translocation-positive and -negative groups for the TRAIL-R4 and TRAIL-R1
expression were highly significant (p=0.0001 and p=0.0004, respectively).
However, the differential expression pattern did not correlate with the number of
leukemic cells. Our results suggest a correlation between the presence of

The aim of this study was to assess quantitative and qualitative alterations in
the carrier rate of Candida spp. in south-eastern Turkey among adolescents, and
to investigate the effect of fixed orthodontic appliances on the Candida count in
a 1-year follow-up study. In the first phase of the study, the oral Candida
carriage rate of 72 patients was evaluated. Samples were collected from the
dorsal surface of the tongue, the mid-palate and saliva. In the second phase of
the study, 42 patients who were determined to be carriers of oral Candida were
treated with fixed orthodontic appliances, and from these patients a second set
of samples were collected from the saliva and the orthodontic brace surfaces of
eight teeth adjacent to the enamel surfaces. The saliva samples were collected
before and during orthodontic treatment at 1st, 6th and 12th month, and samples
from the braces were collected during the 1st, 6th and 12th month of treatment.
Forty-two of the 72 patients (58.5%) were oral Candida carriers. The distribution
of Candida spp. in these patients was as follows: (i) Candida albicans was
identified in 31 patients (73.8%), (ii) C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. kefyr
were found in three patients each (7.14%) and (iii) C. parapsilosis occurred in
two patients (4.76%). During orthodontic treatment, the micro-organism count
increased both in the saliva and on tooth surfaces. The results indicate that the
prevalence of oral Candida spp. is high in young adults in south-eastern Turkey
and that the Candida counts increase when braces are involved.

University, 35340 Izmir, Turkey. belde.kasap@deu.edu.tr

We investigated the question of whether IgM deposition causes any difference in
the histomorphometry of children with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis 
(MePGN). We retrospectively compared the urinalysis, blood pressure measurements,
and serum creatinine levels of children with IgM (+) and IgM (-) MePGN. For
histopathological evaluation, the outlines of Bowman's capsules and glomerular
tufts of 10 glomeruli were rimmed manually, and the surrounded areas were
calculated as pixels. The cells at each tuft of the largest four glomeruli were
counted. Bowman's capsular areas, glomerular tuft areas, glomerular
cellularities, and the number of cells per tuft area were determined for each
patient. There were 24 (M/F: 14/10) patients with MePGN. Twelve of them were IgM 
(+). Mean age at biopsy was 6.8+/-4.1 years. IgM (+) patients mostly presented
with nephrotic syndrome (NS) (n=9) and IgM (-) patients mostly with macroscopic
hematuria (n=7). None of the clinical or laboratory findings was statistically
different between the groups (p>0.05) except increased NS frequency in IgM (+)
patients (p: 0.038). The histomorphometric parameters were similar in both groups
(p>0.05). IgM (+) patients with MePGN mostly presented with NS in our study, but 
their histomorphometric parameters demonstrated no significant difference.

Nuclear protein contents in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of trisomy 21
infants.

Author information:

Turkey. zhamurcu@erciyes.edu.tr

OBJECTIVE: The trisomy 21 (Ts21) or Down's syndrome (DS) phenotype is assumed to 
occur primarily by the expression/overexpression of some genes encoded by the
extra chromosome 21. It has recently been shown by AgNOR staining that babies
with Ts21 have more AgNOR area (more NOR proteins) and more RNA content in their 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than those of controls. The aim of
this study was to test whether or not the nuclear proteins content of PBMCs from 
trisomy 21 babies/infants is higher than that of the controls.
METHOD: For this purpose, flow cytometric measurement of the stained PBMC nuclei 
was used. Nuclei from PBMCs was isolated and stained with propidium iodide and
fluorescein isothiocyanate (PI/FITC) for DNA and protein estimation,
respectively.
RESULTS: Mean nuclear protein content of Ts21's (N = 30, mean age = 3.46 +/- 3.05
years old) PBMCs was found statistically higher than that of the controls (N =
33, mean age = 3.79 +/- 1.93 years old) (P = 0.005, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U 
test for two independent variables). This means that the average nuclear protein 
content of PBMC from Ts21 infants is higher than that of the controls.
Furthermore, there is a moderate negative correlation between the ages of the
studied DS patients and the protein content in the nuclei of their PBMCs (Linear 
regression analysis: P = 0.002, r = -0.55). This correlation is not found with
controls (P = 0.186, r = -0.24).
CONCLUSION: We have concluded that average protein content of PBMCs' nuclei from 
DS infants is higher than that of the controls, decreasing significantly with
age.

Role of fragile histidine triad protein expression in pathogenesis of malignant
pleural mesothelioma.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep,
Turkey. tutar@gantep.edu.tr

AIM: To investigate the relationship of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) and Ki-67 
expression with clinicopathological variables of patients with malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM).
METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 30 asbestos induced
MPM (epithelial and biphasic) patients were examined for FHIT and Ki-67
expression using immunohistochemical techniques and results were compared with
clinicopathological variables.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical study results were as follows: 12 (40%) cases showed
low FHIT expression and 18 (60%) showed high expression. There was no significant
relationship between FHIT and age, gender or histological subtypes (p > 0.05).
Ki-67 expression was 'low' in 13 (43.3%) cases and 'high' in 17 (56.7%) cases. No
correlation could be demonstrated between Ki-67 expression and age, gender or
histological subtypes (p > 0.05). No significant association was observed between
FHIT and Ki-67 expression in MPM.
CONCLUSION: The results support the role of FHIT as a tumour suppressor gene in
asbestos induced MPM. There is no significant correlation between FHIT and cell
proliferation marker expressions in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Therefore, it
can be concluded that loss of FHIT does not interfere with tumour proliferation. 
This can be accepted as evidence for an early role of FHIT loss in
carcinogenesis; however, it needs to be strengthened by further studies.

Does HepPar-1 immunoexpression have a role in differential diagnosis of
periampullary cancer?

Capa, Istanbul, Turkey. mggullu@istanbul.edu.tr

AIMS: Histological subtyping of periampullary carcinomas is considered as a
criterion for prognosis and therapeutic implications of these tumours. We
assessed the immunoexpression rates of HepPar-1, CDX2 and MUC2 antibodies in
different subtypes of periampullary adenocarcinomas (PAC), intestinal and
pancreatobiliary, in order to assess their impact on differential diagnosis of
this group of cancers. The expression of antibodies was also measured in ductal
adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head (DAPH).
METHODS: Sixty-five patients with PAC and DAPH who underwent pancreatic Whipple
resection constituted the study cohort. Of these, 46 (71%) had PAC, and 19 (29%) 
had DAPH. Among PACs, 20 (44%) were intestinal and 26 (56%) were pancreatobiliary
type.
RESULTS: HepPar-1 immunoreactivity was detected in 18 (39%) of all PACs. The rate
of HepPar-1 expression was significantly higher in intestinal type PAC (75%) than
it was in pancreatobiliary type (12%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
of HepPar-1 immunoexpression for diagnosing intestinal type PAC were 75% , 89%,
and 83%, respectively. Similarly, the rates of both CDX2 and MUC2 expressions
were significantly higher in intestinal type PAC (80%) than they were in
pancreatobiliary type (8%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both
CDX2 and MUC2 immunoexpressions for intestinal type PAC were 80%, 92%, and 87%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: HepPar-1 antibody was found to be a highly sensitive and specific
marker for distinguishing intestinal type from pancreatobiliary type among PACs. 
In addition to CDX2 and MUC2 antibodies, HepPar-1 immunoexpression seems to have 
a potential role in differential diagnosis of PACs.

ves@ttnet.net.tr

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the internal consistency and
screening properties of the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in Turkish patients with leprosy.
METHODS: The two screening instruments and a fully structured diagnostic
interview (CIDI) were administered to 65 people drawn from all leprosy inpatient 
units in Turkey between March and June of 2001. The scales were evaluated using
Cronbach's alpha and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses. For each 
scale, criterion validity was assessed for any psychiatric disorder, depressive
disorder and anxiety disorder.
RESULTS: The Cronbach alpha coefficients for the GHQ-12 and HADS were 0.84 and
0.81 respectively. For detecting any psychiatric disorder, the optimal cut-off
for the GHQ-12 was 4/5 (sensitivity 0.82, specificity 0.62). The optimal cut-off 
for the HADS total score was 12/13 (sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.77).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the General Health Questionnaire-12 and
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale have satisfactory internal consistency, and
performed well to a similar extent for detecting psychiatric disorders in leprosy
patients.

c-KIT expression in columnar cell lesions of the breast accompanied by benign and
malignant breast diseases.

Author information:

Turkey. aysep@yahoo.com

Columnar cell lesions (CCLs) of the breast are reported with increasing
frequency. However, the significance of these lesions and the treatment approach 
to these lesions are still unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 
c-KIT expression in CCLs accompanying benign and malignant breast diseases. A
total of 65 patients (18 benign breast diseases, 8 ductal carcinomas in situ
(DCI), and 39 invasive carcinomas) were included in the study. c-KIT was strongly
expressed in normal breast epithelium (staining intensity; SI: 3 +/- 0.0),
whereas a heterogeneous and cytoplasmic staining pattern was observed in CCLs
accompanying both benign and malignant diseases. c-KIT expression was decreased, 
with increasing atypia in CCLs (SI in CCLs with/without atypia; 1.45 +/- 0.52/no 
case, 1.25 +/- 0.50/1.38 +/- 0.52, 0.77 +/- 0.73/1.21 +/- 0.42 accompanying
benign breast disease, DCI and invasive carcinoma, respectively). c-KIT
expression was detected in 10.4% of invasive carcinomas. No significant
association between c-KIT expression and the histologic grade and nodal status of
tumor was noted. As there is a reduction in c-KIT expression with malignant
transformation of breast epithelium, c-KIT is believed to play a role in breast
carcinogenesis. Furthermore, similar c-KIT expression patterns in CCLs
accompanying malignant breast diseases suggest that at least some CCLs could
reflect a premalignant status of breast carcinoma. However, the significance of
c-KIT expression in CCLs and its relationship to breast carcinogenesis should be 
evaluated in follow up studies investigating larger series.

Omentectomy for gynecologic cancer: how much sampling is adequate for microscopic
examination?

CONTEXT: Detecting omental metastasis is crucial for staging and treatment of
endometrial and ovarian carcinoma.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal omental sampling for omentectomies to
ascertain the stage of the disease in a cost-effective way.
DESIGN: We reevaluated 258 omentectomies that were performed due to ovarian or
endometrial carcinoma. A total of 116 cases were retrospectively studied, and 142
cases were prospectively studied. For prospective study, 10 to 16 blocks were
sampled if the omentum showed no signs of gross tumor. Mean omental block sample 
frequency of 2 groups with the negative macroscopy but with or without
microscopic tumor have been compared using an independent samples t test.
RESULTS: Seven patients had no evidence of tumor metastasis on gross examination 
but had microscopic tumor metastasis. The mean numbers of blocks were 6.4 for
patients having microscopic tumor without macroscopic involvement and 7.8 for
patients having neither microscopic nor macroscopic involvement. Approximately
twice as many samples were taken in the prospective analysis when compared with
retrospective analysis. Two cases with microscopic omental metastasis that had no
macroscopic involvement at first impression were reevaluated retrospectively and 
found to contain 0.3- to 0.5-cm white nodules. The rate of omental metastasis
increased with the grade of the tumor (P = .005).
CONCLUSION: Careful macroscopic examination is the most important step in
detecting small omental metastasis. For cases with gross tumor, one section is
sufficient. If a macroscopic lesion is not detectable and the patient has a
high-grade tumor that will necessitate an adjuvant therapy, 3 to 5 samples seem
sufficient for staging. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum
sample size for tumors having a low risk of metastasis.

Relation of neuroendocrine cells to transforming growth factor-alpha and
epidermal growth factor receptor expression in gastric adenocarcinomas:
prognostic implications.

Altunizade, Turkey. turege@superonline.com.tr

The presence of neuroendocrine (NE) cells in gastric adenocarcinoma (GCa) is well
documented, however, their significance is controversial. There is no evidence in
the literature concerning the possible effect of these cells on the expression of
TGF-alpha and EGFR, which are believed to confer growth advantage to tumor cells.
101 partial or total gastrectomy specimens from patients operated for
conventional gastric adenocarcinoma were included in the study. In each case
immunohistochemistry was performed on sequential tissue sections for chromogranin
A (ChrA), TGF-alpha and EGFR. Samples were graded based on the number of
ChrA-positive cells (0-3). TGF-alpha and EGFR expressions were evaluated
according to both the intensity (0-2) and quantification of the positively
stained areas (0-3). Follow-up data was available in 54 patients. Twenty-seven
patients died of disease, while 27 patients were alive with a follow-up of at
least 15 months. ChrA expression was detected in 54.4% of the tumor specimens.
TGF-alpha was stained positively in 42.6% and EGFR in 49.5% of the cases. NE
cells in GCa was related to TGF-alpha (p<0.0001) and EGFR expression (p<0.05),
and TGF-alpha/EGFR coexpression (p<0.001). Among histopathologic variables, the
presence of NE cells was significantly related to grade, stage and lymph node
status. Although the presence of NE cells had no effect on survival, the
expression of EGFR (p<0.0001) and TGF-alpha (p=0.002) were related to survival.
The results of our study suggest that the presence of NE cells may have an effect
on the expression of TGF-alpha and EGFR in GCa, and the autocrine mechanism
between TGF-alpha and EGFR plays an important role in the prognosis of gastric
carcinoma.

HER-2, TOP2A and chromosome 17 alterations in breast cancer.

Author information:

Istanbul, Capa, Turkey.

HER-2 amplification is a biomarker for identifying patients who respond to
trastuzumab and has been evaluated as a factor predicting the response to
anthracyclines. The relationship between HER-2 and response to anthracycline
therapy may also be the result of the close localization of TOP2A on 17q. It has 
been a matter of debate whether these two genes, HER-2 and TOP2A, behave
separately on different amplicons or act together thus making it possible to
predict the TOP2A status from the HER-2 status. In this study TOP2A, HER-2 and
chromosome 17 aneusomy were investigated by fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) in 50 consecutive breast cancer patients. HER-2 amplification was detected
in 11 patients (22%) and TOP2A changes were seen in 6 patients (12%); two
amplifications and two deletions were observed in HER-2-amplified cases and two
deletions in HER-2-nonamplified cases. Three of the TOP2A-deleted cases had
polysomy 17. HER-2 copy number was higher than the TOP2A copy number in one
patient with co-amplification. Polysomy was observed in 9 cases (18%) and
monosomy in 6 cases (12%). Aneusomy was the sole anomaly in 11 patients (22%). We
conclude that the TOP2A status cannot be predicted from the HER-2 status and
evaluation of the TOP2A status only in patients with HER-2 overexpression may
lead to missing cases with TOP2A deletion with possible resistance to therapy.
Other factors modulating topo II activity may also affect the response to
therapy. Studies evaluating different parameters that can modulate topo II
activity and the response to the drugs targeting the enzyme are necessary.

OBJECTIVE: To reveal the diagnostic and prognostic significance of eosinophilic
pleural effusions (EPEs) and assess their clinical implications.
STUDY DESIGN: Seventy EPEs from 60 patients among 697 consecutive pleural
effusions were investigated from 1996-2005 at Kocaeli University Hospital,
Kocaeli, Turkey. Koss and Light's criteria were applied in the analysis, which
comprised macroscopic, cytopathologic, biochemical and microbiologic
examinations.
RESULTS: Overall, cancerous underlying conditions were diagnosed in 22 patients
(13 malignant and 9 paramalignant), 36.7% of EPEs. Benign causes were found in
43.3% (26 of 60) of the patients. Twelve pleural effusions (20.0%) were
idiopathic. The comparison of pleural fluid and peripheral blood findings
disclosed no significant difference among the various subgroups.
CONCLUSION: EPE could be associated with inflammatory, benign, cancerous and
paramalignant conditions. A closer search for a definite causes is warranted in
the setting of EPEs, especially in populations with a high prevalence of
tuberculosis and malignancy, such as in Kocaeli, Turkey, an industrial city in a 
developing country.

Simultaneously occurring vestibular schwannoma and meningioma in the
cerebellopontine angle: case report and literature review.

yusufizci@yahoo.com

Simultaneously occurring multiple primary brain tumors of different histological 
types are rare, and the coexistence of schwannoma and meningioma in the same
cerebellopontine angle (CPA) without neurofibromatosis is extremely rare. A
57-year-old female patient presented with headache, speech disturbance, left
facial numbness and deafness in the left ear. Magnetic resonance imaging
demonstrated two different tumors in the left CPA. These tumors were not in
continuity. The tumors were totally removed through the left suboccipital
approach. Histopathological examination revealed that the large tumor was a
vestibular schwannoma and the smaller was a meningioma. Neurofibromatosis was not
diagnosed in the patient. No recurrence was observed at the end of 9 years after 
the operation. The simultaneous occurrence of vestibular schwannoma and
meningioma in the CPA appears coincidental. This association must be kept in mind
if two different tumors are detected radiologically in the same CPA.

The effect of altitude on renal failure and bone mineralization is not well
known. This topic is studied in a 5/6 nephrectomy rat model. After hemoglobin,
creatinine clearance and proteinuria were determined in 28 Wistar rats. Two 5/6
nephrectomy (Nx1-Nx2, n=7 each) and two sham (Sh1-Sh2, n=7 each) groups were
formed. The Nx1-Sh1 and Nx2-Sh2 groups were kept at sea level and at 1200 m
altitude, respectively. The same analyses were performed after 3 months just
before sacrifices in order to harvest kidneys and femurs for histopathologic
examination. Hemoglobin, creatinine clearance, and proteinuria were similar in
all groups at the onset. Final hemoglobin was higher in Nx2-Sh2, but only Sh2 vs.
Sh1 was significant (p=0.001). Creatinine clearance decreased (p=0.001 for Nx1)
and proteinuria increased (p=0.002 for Nx1 and p=0.005 for Nx2) after 5/6
nephrectomy, but Nx1 vs. Nx2 was similar. Histopathological changes in the
remnant kidneys were prominent, but Nx1 vs. Nx2 was not different. Although the
relative osteoid volume increased in Nx groups, only Nx1 vs. Sh1 was different
(p=0.006). In conclusion, exposure to 1200 m altitude, compared to the sea level,
preserved the creatinine clearance better in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. No change
was observed in proteinuria, renal histopathology, and bone mineralization.

Prenatal ultrasonographical features of limb body wall complex: a review of
etiopathogenesis and a new classification.

Limb body wall complex is a spectrum of multiple severe anomalies. The
etiopathogenesis and clinical classification are still under discussion. In our
article, while reviewing previous etiopathogenetical hypothesis, we propose a new
clinical classification regarding embryological theories and pheneotypical
features. According to the Van Allen diagnostic criteria, the findings of 6
affected fetuses are presented. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 5 of 6 cases.
Craniofacial malformations were present in only 1 case. Thoracic defect and
abdominoschisis (either infraumbilical or supraumbilical) associated with
visceral eventration, placental-umbilical cord anomalies, and limb defects were
detected in the other 5 cases. Aberrant development of each of the 4 embryonic
folds (cephalic, 2 lateral abdominal, and caudal) associated with faulty
umbilical ring development and placental formation were considered responsible
for development of various malformations. In previous clinical classifications,
existence or absence of the craniofacial malformation was utilized as an unique
discriminating criterion while multiple anomalies exist. In this report, we
propose a new clinical classification concerning almost all anomalies caused by
defective placental attachment and maldevelopment of the 4 folds.

Dimethoate is an organophosphorus insecticide and acaricide used for the control 
of a wide range of insects, including houseflies and mites, on a variety of
fruits, vegetables, field and forestry crops. The aim of the current study was to
evaluate the subchronic toxicity of orally administered dimethoate in Wistar
albino rats, based on the histopathological and biochemical findings in the
liver. The animals of the exposed groups were fed with laboratory chow combined
with 2, 8 or 20 mg/kg body weight/day dimethoate for 90 consecutive days under
controlled laboratory conditions. At the end of the experiment, body weight gain,
absolute and relative liver weights, liver cholinesterase activities and total
protein levels were determined. Histopathological changes in the liver were also 
determined using a light microscope. Results showed that there were decreases in 
relative liver weights of exposed rats. Although liver total protein levels were 
significantly increased, liver cholinesterase activities were decreased in all
exposed groups. Dimethoate caused dose-related histopathological changes such as 
mononuclear cell infiltration, congestion, an enlargement of the veins and
sinusoids, hepatocellular damage, necrotic changes, an increase in the number of 
Kupffer cells, cytoplasmic vacuolization and degeneration in nuclei in the liver 
of exposed rats. These effects did not vary between the sexes.

A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PTPN22 gene encoding the
protein tyrosine phosphatase has been reported to be associated with autoimmune
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type I
diabetes. PTPN22 R620W polymorphism has a wide variation of allelic frequencies
among different populations. This polymorphism is investigated in Turkish
patients with Behçet's disease (BD), a systemic vasculitis with immune
activation. DNA samples from 134 patients with BD and 177 healthy controls are
genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length
polymorphism method for the SNP (rs2476601, A/G) of PTPN22 gene. Polymorphic
region was amplified by PCR and digested with XcmI enzyme. The frequency of
heterozygous genotype (AG) was 5.1% (9/177) in control group, whereas polymorphic
allele was not present in the whole BD group (P = 0.012, OR 0.65, 95% confidence 
interval 0.0-1.1). Both the lower prevalence in the general population and the
absence in BD show the limited role of PTPN22 polymorphism in the pathogenesis of
autoimmunity in Turkey.

Pathology, Kurupelit, 55139 Samsun, Turkey. mygulbahar@hotmail.com

The present study describes the pathogenetic mechanisms of myocarditis in 9 lambs
that died in a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Samsun, Turkey. In all the
heart samples tested, ELISA and sequencing for phylogenetic analyses showed that 
the virus, namely O/TUR/Samsun/05, was associated with the PanAsia pandemic
strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type O. The lambs had myocardial
lesions but no typical vesicular lesions. In situ reverse transcription showed
that many cardiomyocytes and some interstitial cells were positive for FMDV type 
O. Inflammatory infiltration, hyaline degeneration, and necrosis of sheets of
myocytes were observed. The cellular infiltrates were mononuclear cells,
including many lymphocytes, macrophages, a few plasma cells, and neutrophils.
Major histocompatibility complex Class II+ dendritic and mononuclear cells,
gammadelta T cells, CD172A+ and CD14+ macrophages and monocytes, and IgM+ B cells
were detected mainly in the infected hearts. Inducible nitric oxide synthetase
(iNOS) was seen mostly in areas of inflammation infiltrated by large numbers of
cells. Of the 2 alpha-subunits of integrin known to be used as receptors by FMDV 
in epithelial tissues, CD49e (integrin alpha5) was detected in the membranes of
cardiac myocytes with intercalated discs, but CD51 (integrin alphaV) was not
detected in cardiac myocytes from infected or normal lambs. Interstitial and
inflammatory cells were positive for both integrin subunits. The terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive
signal was detected in the nuclei of both cardiac myocytes and interstitial cells
from infected lambs. These findings suggest that the iNOS expressed by
inflammatory cells in lesions may have a deleterious effect on cardiac myocytes
in these lesions.

There is little quantitative information about the amount of fibrosis in
lymphomas. The aim of the present study was to investigate the amount of fibrosis
in lymphomas and to highlight the relationship between fibrosis and mast cells,
the key players of fibrosis. Tissue sections of 60 patients with diagnosis of
lymphoma were reevaluated for classification. The mean fibrotic-stained area
percentage (F-SAP) was determined in van Gieson-stained digital images using
image analysis (Mediscope, Dokuz Eylul University, Clinical Engineering, Turkey).
Mast cells were visualized using streptavidin peroxidase immunohistochemistry
with anti-tryptase staining. Twenty-seven (44%) cases were Hodgkin's lymphoma
(HL). F-SAP was 11.09+/-8.96 and 1.72+/-1.76 for HL and non-HL cases
(Mann-Whitney U, p<0.000), and the mean mast cell count (MMCC) was 24.63+/-13.58 
and 8.03+/-8.07, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.000). There was a
significant difference between F-SAP and MMCC concerning different types of
lymphomas (Kruskal-Wallis test, p>0.000). F-SAP was highest in nodular sclerosis 
HL, and MMCC was highest in mixed cellular HL. There was a strong positive
correlation between MMCC and F-SAP (Pearson Correlation test, p<0.000, r=0.51).
These results suggest that the amount of fibrosis demonstrates differences in
subtypes of lymphomas, and mast cells are increased in fibrosing lymphomas.
However, it seems likely that more than one cell type is involved.

The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of the increase in
intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the mucosa of the appendix. One hundred and
four retrospective appendectomy specimens were examined to evaluate the IELs.
Intraepithelial lymphocytosis was identified in 11.5% (12 cases) of the
specimens. Of these 12 cases, 6 cases with intraepithelial lymphocytosis were
associated with parasitic infection. No increase in IELs was found in the 36
appendices that were removed in other primary operations. A wide range of
immunologic stimuli can raise IELs in the gastrointestinal system. However, in
appendectomies with clinical signs of acute appendicitis, an increase in IELs is 
more likely to be related to parasitic infection. This increase should be
considered for the diagnosis of parasitic infections.

BACKGROUND: The hepatoid variant of yolk sac tumor (H-YST) is an exceedingly rare
and highly malignant neoplasm. We present and discuss our experience with
cytologic and histopathologic features of a mediastinal H-YST presenting with
sternum metastasis, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
reported.
CASE: A 38-year-old man presented with a large mass on the sternum. Computed
tomography of the thorax showed a large anterior mediastinal mass with sternum
metastsis and multiple lung metastases. Laboratory examination revealed elevated 
serum alpha-fetoprotein (60,000 IU/mL). No tumor was found in the other organ
systems. A percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy and subsequent open
surgical biopsy were performed on the sternum metastasis. Cytologically, the
tumor was composed of monotonous, large, round to polygonal hepatoid cells
forming solid sheets and trabeculae entrapped with endothelial cells resembling
hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathologic sections of tumor showed tumor cells
with eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm arranged in a solid, trabecular growth
pattern, with some acinar formations. Immunohistochemical study supported the
hepatoid origin.
CONCLUSION: Fine needle aspiration cytology, together with the characteristic
clinical presentations and specific tumor markers, is crucial to the initial
diagnosis of H-YST.

mice.

L-carnitine is a cofactor in the transfer of long-chain fatty acid allowing the
beta-oxidation of fatty acid in the mitochondria. It is also a known antioxidant 
with protective effects against lipid peroxidation. In this study,
hepatoprotective effect of L-carnitine was investigated against acetaminophen
(AA)-induced liver toxicity where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress 
are thought to be involved in AA hepatotoxicity. Sixty-four Balb/C mice were
divided into eight groups. Mice were dosed with single-AA injection (500 mg/kg
via the intra peritoneal route) with or without L-carnitine (500 mg/kg for 5 days
starting 5 days before AA injection via intra peritoneal route) and sampled at 4,
8 and 24 h following AA injection. AA increased serum AST, ALT, total sialic acid
(TSA) and MDA as well as tissue TSA and MDA levels significantly with the highest
increase observed at 4 h, but there was a decrease in blood and tissue GSH level.
Administration of L-carnitine significantly reduced AA-induced elevations in AST,
ALT, TSA and MDA concentrations and increased GSH levels at all sampling points. 
AA also induced necrosis, hyperemia, sinusoidal congestion and hemorrhage with
time-dependent increase in severity, but the degree of necrosis and
histopathologic alterations were most severe at 24 h following AA administration.
However, the degree of pathologic alterations was less severe with simultaneous
L-carnitine application. These results suggest that AA results in oxidative
damage in the liver with an acute effect. L-carnitine also has a prominent
protective effect against AA toxicity and may be of therapeutic value in the
treatment of AA-induced hepatotoxicity.

University of Gaziantep, Turkey. aysenbayram@hotmail.com

AIMS: This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between total
intrahepatic hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels and liver histology in terms of
the degree of histological activity index (HAI) that yields necroinflammation
(HAI-NI) and fibrosis (HAI-F) of the liver.
METHODS: Prospectively, Tru-cut needle biopsy samples were obtained from the
livers of 42 patients with chronic hepatitis B. Levels of serum and liver HBV DNA
were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Demographic data of patients,
together with hepatitis B serology, alanine aminotransferase levels, and HAI-NI
and HAI-F scores, were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty of the patients were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive,
while 22 patients were positive for antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). Serum and liver
total HBV DNA levels were found to correlate directly with each other in the two 
groups (r = 0.669, p = 0.001; and r = 0.880, p<0.001; respectively) and the
correlation was more marked in anti-HBe-positive patients. Although serum HBV DNA
levels correlated positively with HAI-NI and HAI-F scores in HBeAg-positive and
HBeAg-negative patients, total liver HBV DNA levels correlated with HAI-NI and
HAI-F scores in anti-HBe-positive patients only.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative measurement of intrahepatic HBV DNA is a valuable
marker of the histological status of the liver in anti-HBe-positive patients with
chronic hepatitis B, and it may give an insight into the prognosis and the ideal 
time for the cessation of antiviral treatment.

BACKGROUND: In this study, the neuroprotective effects of caffeic acid phenethyl 
ester (CAPE) in the hippocampus of cigarette smoke exposed rabbits were
investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen rabbits were used as experimental subjects and
divided into three equal groups. The control group (Group A) was exposed to clean
air. Rabbits in the cigarette smoke (CS) group (Group B) were exposed to
cigarette smoke 1 hour daily in a room within a glass chamber for 4 weeks.
Animals in the CS+CAPE group (Group C) were exposed to cigarette smoke as in
Group B and administered CAPE (10 micromol/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 4 weeks 
just before the exposure to cigarette smoke. Rabbits in all three groups were
sacrificed with intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg sodium pentothal and 
their brains were removed immediately. In the hippocampal formation samples of
left hemispheres, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase
(SOD) were measured and the number of apoptotic neurons was counted by 'terminal 
transferase dUTP nick end labelling' (TUNEL) assay in the right hippocampal
formation.
RESULTS: We found that MDA levels increased significantly in the Group B rabbits 
compared with the control group (Group A; p = 0.001). In contrast, SOD activities
decreased significantly in Group B rabbits compared with the control group (p =
0.001). In the CAPE treated rabbits (Group C), MDA levels decreased and SOD
activities increased significantly as compared with Group B rabbits (p = 0.002, p
= 0.002, respectively). The number of apoptotic neurons (TUNEL+) in the CA1, CA2,
CA3 and dentate gyrus areas of rabbits' hippocampal formation were significantly 
increased in Group B rabbits compared with the control group. On the other hand, 
the number of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus areas was decreased
significantly in Group C rabbits compared with Group B rabbits.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cigarette smoking induces apoptosis in
the hippocampal formation of rabbits and CAPE has a protective role against this 
induction.

A 27-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and dyspepsia was found to
have a calcified mass in the upper-middle right kidney. Gross examination of the 
nephrectomy specimen revealed a 6.5 x 5 x 4 cm renal tumor with dense
calcification and ossification. Histopathological examination of the tumor showed
solid, trabecular sheets and nesting of polygonal epithelial cells with abundant 
cytoplasm and prominent cell border and mature bony tissue enclosing fatty
marrow. Renal cell carcinoma is frequently associated with calcification, but
ossification is extremely rare. To our knowledge, we report the fourth case of a 
chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with extensive calcification and ossification.

The coexistence of renal cell carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is more common
than expected in the general population; however, renal cell carcinoma with
infiltration by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has rarely been reported. Here we report
on a 77-year-old patient who presented with small lymphocytic lymphoma in the
jugulodigastric lymph node. He underwent nephrectomy for a renal mass 5 months
later. On histopathological examination, the mass was diagnosed as a grade III
renal cell carcinoma with infiltrated small lymphocytic lymphoma that was
positive for B-cells (CD20). This case is discussed in terms of the coexistence
of these tumors and tumor to tumor metastasis.

Mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal system with variable histopathological
appearances and constant expression of CD117 are known as gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GISTs). Neuroendocrine tumors may be seen in the gastrointestinal
system and other organ systems of the body. We report a 44-year-old male patient 
with a 6.5 x 3 x 6cm mass located in the Ampulla of Vater. Histopathologic
examination revealed a GIST with a marked nuclear pleomorphism and a high mitotic
rate, and that was rich in osteoclast-like giant cells (OGC).
Immunohistochemically, GIST was positive for CD117, while OGCs were negative for 
CD117 and positive for CD68 and alpha1-antitrypsin. There was also found a
well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor near the GIST, in the serosal aspect of 
the duodenum at the point of the Ampulla of Vater. This second tumor was 20mm in 
diameter, and was relatively well circumscribed with few glands invading the
GIST. This tumor was positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin. Neither mitosis
nor vascular invasion was observed. The patient had no familial history or
clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis. This case presents the unique
synchronous existence of two extremely rare entities, a GIST with OGC and a
well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, both located in the Ampulla of Vater.

Encephalopathy is a common complication of sepsis. However, little is known about
the morphological changes that occur in the brain during sepsis. In this study,
fecal peritonitis was induced in Wistar rats, which had been monitored for 4 h
before their brains were removed and samples from the CA1 area taken. In addition
to higher blood pressure with a decreasing pattern and a significant drop in
rectal temperature, an increased heart rate and marked respiratory failure were
observed. The tissue was investigated and compared with corresponding hippocampal
samples taken from sham-operated and not operated control groups. Significantly
more peri-microvascular edema was found in the hippocampal CA1 area in the septic
group. The percentages of the peri-microvascular edema were 158.57 +/- 3.6%,
122.84 +/- 1.5% and 120.24 +/- 1.9% in the fecal peritonitis group, sham-operated
and not operated control groups, respectively. The results may suggest that the
edema observed around the microvessels may participate in the pathogenesis of the
septic encephalopathy probably by causing in the microvascular permeability
characteristics.

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular neoplasm of uncertain
malignant potential. Various reports document metastatic or concurrent
epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in several sites, most commonly with combined
lung and liver involvement. The concurrent involvement of multiple sites at
presentation may cause diagnostic problems because epithelioid
hemangioendothelioma can mimic other neoplastic processes. Although it is a
chemo-resistant disease, chemotherapy is usually advised for patients with
metastatic or concurrent involvement. Here we document the presentation,
treatment, and outcome of two cases with concurrent involvement of the lung and
liver.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in experimental cirrhosis: correlation
with vascular endothelial growth factor expression and angiogenesis.

Bozova S(1), Elpek GO.

Author information: 
(1)Akdeniz University, Medical School, Department of Pathology, Antalya, Turkey.

Angiogenesis progresses together with fibrogenesis during chronic liver injury.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a master regulator of homeostasis, 
plays a pivotal role in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis through its regulation of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The association between hypoxia,
angiogenesis and VEGF expression has been demonstrated in experimental cirrhosis.
However, expression of HIF-1alpha has yet to be reported. The aim of this study
was to investigate the significance of HIF-1alpha expression during experimental 
liver fibrosis and the relationships between HIF-1alpha expression, VEGF
expression and angiogenesis. Cirrhosis was induced in male Wistar rats by
intraperitoneal administration of diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) (100 mg/kg, once a
week). The serial sections from liver tissues were stained with anti-HIF-1alpha, 
anti-VEGF and anti-CD34 antibodies before being measured by light microscopy. Our
results showed that HIF-1alpha expression gradually increases according to the
severity of fibrosis (p<0.01). Moreover, its expression was found to be
correlated with angiogenesis (r=0.916) and VEGF expression (r=0.969). The present
study demonstrates that HIF-1alpha might have a role in the development of
angiogenesis via regulation of VEGF during experimental liver fibrogenesis and
suggests that this factor could be a potential target in the manipulation of
angiogenesis in chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver.

(TTS) is a very rare pathological association, often discovered during repair for
inguinal hernia or cryptorchidism. We present 2 cases with PMDS associated with
TTS and discuss the diagnosis and management. A hysterectomy was performed, with 
resection of the underdeveloped fallopian tubes. Both gonads wereplaced into
subdartos pouches in each scrotum by the transseptal approach. The diagnosis of
PMDS was confirmed postoperatively by genetic and hormonal investigations.
Chromosome analysis revealed 46,XY. Pathological findings demonstrated the
immature testes and the immature uterus.

Metastatic spread of primary bladder cancer to the penis is an extremely rare
event. Microcystic urothelial carcinoma is a very rare variant of urothelial
carcinoma. Due to its rareness and insufficient clinical follow-up data, the
prognosis of microcystic urothelial carcinoma is still not clear. Here in we
report a case of a penile metastasis from microcystic urothelial carcinoma of
urinary bladder, in a 56-year-old man who died 6 months after radical
cystoprostatectomy and total penectomy. To the best of our knowledge this is the 
first case report of microcystic variant of urothelial carcinoma which has
metastasized to the penis.

The present study describes pathologic and virologic findings in 15 sheep and 6
goats that died of natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection in Turkey. 
Pathologic findings included erosive-ulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic
tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulation necroses in the
liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in lymphoid tissues. Syncytial cells were
conspicuous, especially in the oral mucosa, pulmonary alveoli, liver, and
lymphoid tissues. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic
intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions were observed in epithelial cells
lining the renal pelvis and abomasal mucosa. Immunolabeling of the viral antigen 
was observed in the kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart, and myocytes of the
tongue besides its more typical locations. In this study, we report and describe 
in detail the first peste des petits ruminants endemic in Kirikkale Province,
Central Anatolia of Turkey. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathologic
findings in natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection establish a basis 
for resemblance to other morbillivirus infections, such as canine distemper and
distemper of sea mammals. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
analyses indicated that the 448-bp genome fragment was amplified in 18 cases
(18/21, 85.7 %). Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses belong to lineage 4 in
the peste des petits ruminants virus common phylogenetic tree.

Presented herein is a case of diffuse fatty infiltration of amyloid goiter in a
58-year-old woman with chronic renal failure. Bilateral total thyroidectomy was
performed due to symptoms of dysphagia and hoarseness. Macroscopic and
microscopic examination showed that almost all thyroid follicles were replaced by
fat cells. Hyalinized stroma intervening the fatty infiltration was shown to
harbor amyloid deposition.

Turkey. ncomunoglu@yeditepe.edu.tr

Spindle cell lipomas are a group of benign lipogenic soft tissue tumors.
Typically they occur in posterior back and shoulder of elderly male patients.
Differential diagnosis of this tumor became more important because the number of 
reports about some other tumors of similar morphology such as mammary type
myofibroblastoma and solitary fibrous tumor, are increasing. All these tumors
compose of bland spindle cells, mature adipocytes and collagen bundles. In this
retrospective study we evaluated clinicopathological and immunohistochemical
features of 18 cases of spindle cell lipomas. 15 cases of classical spindle cell 
lipomas and 3 pleomorphic lipoma variant were all histologically characteristic. 
Immuohistochemically they were all CD34 positive. Ten cases, whose paraffin
blocks available, were desmin negative. We think that spindle cell lipomas are
desmin negative tumors and this feature helps us to differentiate them especially
from mammary type myofibroblastomas of extramammarian soft tissue.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a method that is frequently used in the
diagnosis for neoplastic and non-neoplastic thyroid lesions. However, despite the
contribution of this method to diagnosis, varying degrees of histopathological
alterations in thyroid tissue occur due to the trauma caused by the aspiration
needle. In this study, we compared the histopathology of the thyroidectomy
specimens obtained by FNAB with the specimens obtained without the use of FNAB. A
hundred and fifty thyroidectomy specimens obtained by FNAB were compared
histopathologically with 150 thyroidectomy specimens (control group) obtained
without a FNAB procedure. The thyroidectomy specimens were evaluated for
hemorrhage, fibrosis, siderophagia, vascular thrombosis, vascular proliferation, 
infarction, granulation tissue, cystic degeneration, papillary hyperplasia,
nuclear atypia, mitosis, calcification, vascular invasion, capsular distortion
(pseudoinvasion), cholesterol clefts, and the presence of metaplasia. The
thyroidectomy specimens obtained by FNAB had rates of hemorrhage, siderophagia,
granulation tissue, papillary hyperplasia, fibrosis, calcification, capsular
distortion, cholesterol clefts (P<0.001), and vascular thrombosis (P=0.001) that 
were statistically significantly higher than those obtained without FNAB.
However, there were no clinically significant differences between the two groups 
in terms of vascular proliferation, nuclear atypia, mitosis, infarction, and
oncocytic and squamous metaplasia. Alterations in thyroid tissue in association
with FNAB show a considerable variation. Some of the alterations make diagnosis
difficult, even leading to misdiagnosis in favor of carcinoma. Therefore, a
thorough knowledge of possible alterations is essential to the differential
diagnosis.

Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 
in the diagnosis of cystic masses of the head and neck (H&N), excluding thyroid
lesions.
METHODS: A total of 198 cases, 63 of whom had consequent surgical specimens, were
retrieved from the files of two university hospitals and reviewed.
RESULTS: FNAC correctly diagnosed 25 of 36 neoplasms with a cystic component.
Five Warthin's tumours, two squamous cell carcinomas, two mucoepidermoid
carcinomas and two schwannomas yielded non-representative aspirates. Four of the 
missed Warthin's tumours and two mucoepidermoid carcinomas which were
misdiagnosed as benign cysts were aspirated by their clinician. One branchial
cleft cyst was cytologically interpreted as highly suspicious for carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparate entities may present with similar cytological findings in 
the H&N region. A detailed description of differential diagnosis should be given 
in the cytology report in suspicious cases. Repeated aspirations from different
sites of the lesion may reduce the false-negative rate.

We examined the expression pattern of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and c-kit in
uterine smooth muscle neoplasms and tried to determine the role of these markers 
in differential diagnosis. Archival tissue from 64 patients with uterine smooth
muscle neoplasms (20 leiomyomas (LMs), 22 atypical leiomyomas (ALMs), and 22
leiomyosarcomas (LMSs)) was immunostained with antibodies against estrogen (ER)
and progesterone receptors (PR), COX-2 and c-kit. 7 of 20 LM cases and 5 of 22
ALM cases were immunopositive for COX-2, whereas none of the LMS cases stained
immunopositive (p< or =0.05). 4 of 20 LM cases and 5 of 22 ALM cases were
immunopositive for c-kit, whereas 15 of 22 LMS cases showed c-kit
immunopositivity (p< or =0.05). In conclusion, very few LMs and ALMs show COX-2
immunopositivity. LMSs usually do not express COX-2. COX-2 expression in smooth
muscle tumors is not a prominent feature. Therefore, COX-2 inhibitors may not be 
useful in LMS therapy. C-kit was significantly expressed in uterine LMSs.

Diagnosing and grading cervical cancer precursors is challenging. This study
investigates the presence of HPV infection, the expression of p16, and any
correlation between these two findings. H&E-stained slides of cervical loop
excision materials diagnosed as LSIL and HSIL were reviewed. An
immunohistochemical panel consisting of p16 as well as of all HPV types and
HR-HPV types was applied. Staining of p16 was evaluated according to distribution
extent and degree of intensity. All HSIL cases and 80% of LSIL cases were
positive for p16. In HSIL cases, the staining distribution was as follows: 50%
full thickness, 45% basal, and 5% rare. The staining intensity for the same cases
was strong in 70%, variable in 20%, and weak in 10% accordingly. In LSIL cases,
staining distribution was basal in 58.3% and rare in 41.7%. None of the LSIL
cases showed full thickness of p16 positivity. The staining intensity of the same
cases was strong in 25%, variable in 16.7%, and weak in 58.3%. Of all cases,
48.6% were positive for screening kit (all HPV types), and 31.4% of all cases
were positive for HR-HPV. The distribution of this positivity was 35% for HSIL
and 26.6% for LSIL cases. The total HPV-type positivity rate was 48.6%, the
distribution being 50% for HSIL and 46.6% for LSIL cases. p16 is a highly
sensitive marker for cervical epithelial dysplasia. Strong and full thickness
staining of p16 in the cervix epithelium is highly supportive of HSIL, while weak
and basal/rare staining favors LSIL. All HPV-positive cases were also
p16-positive, but no statistically significant relationship between HPV infection
positivity and the intensity and distribution of p16 was found. HPV is not
helpful in the grading of SIL, as an unignorable rate of HR-HPV positivity
(26.6%) was detected in LSIL group.

Incidental parasitic infestations in surgically removed appendices: a
retrospective analysis.

darkeetar@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Appendiceal parasites can cause symptoms of appendiceal pain,
independent of microscopic evidence of acute inflammation. The diagnosis of a
parasitic infestation is generally achieved only after the pathologic examination
of the resected appendices.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Pathology department records were reviewed for all patients who
required an operation for symptoms of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2006.
The specimens which were pathologically diagnosed to contain parasites were
reevaluated for features of acute inflammation, and parasite type. The medical
records were reviewed in detail to achieve a diagnostic score(Eskelinen).
Radiologic imaging findings were correlated, if present.
RESULTS: Of the 190 appendectomies performed, 6 specimens (3,15%) were found to
contain parasites(4 Enterobius vermicularis, 2 Taenia subspecies). Appendectomies
with Taenia showed acute inflammation, while acute inflammation was absent in the
ones with Enterobius vermicularis. The Eskelinen score was higher than the
threshold in two cases with an acute inflammation, and in two without. Ultrasound
scans, and a computed tomography scan were performed in 5 patients. In 3 of 4
bland appendices, results favored acute appendicitis.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of gastrointestinal parasites is not only made by
examining the stool but the diagnosis can be made by histology from surgical
specimens. Timely diagnosis and appropriate therapy might prevent probable future
complications that may necessitate surgical procedures, at least in some of the
patients. The clinical management of these infections is different from that for 
classical appendicitis.

Immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin, E-cadherin, cyclin D1 and c-myc
in benign trichogenic tumors.

Demirkan NC(1), Bir F, Erdem O, Düzcan E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical School of Pamukkale University, Denizli,
Turkey. ndemirkan@pamukkale.edu.tr

BACKGROUND: beta-catenin gene mutations have been reported in vast majority of
pilomatrixomas (PMXs). beta-catenin, a component of the adhesion molecules of the
cytoskeleton, is degraded at the cytoplasm. Excess cytoplasmic beta-catenin
enters into the nucleus and activates the transcription of several genes encoding
c-myc, cyclin D1 and others. Sublocation of beta-catenin has been demonstrated by
immunohistochemistry. The aim of this study was to determine the role of
beta-catenin-related proteins in various benign trichogenic tumors.
METHODS: We investigated the expression of beta-catenin, E-cadherin, c-myc and
cyclin D1 immunohistochemically, and the expression of these molecules were
compared between two groups consisting of 12 PMXs and 12 other benign trichogenic
tumors (OBTTs).
RESULTS: In PMX group, nuclear and/or cytoplasmic expression of beta-catenin was 
associated with a loss of membranous expression of E-cadherin (p = 0.002). In
OBTT group, a membranous expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin was observed, 
and there was a stronger nuclear immunoreactivity of cyclin D1 compared with PMX 
group (p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: In PMX, nuclear and/or cytoplasmic beta-catenin expression of
tumoral cells is not related with beta-catenin-related gene expressions (c-myc or
cyclin D1). The molecular behaviour of OBTTs is clearly different from that of
PMXs in terms of to E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression.

Methionine-supplemented diet augments hepatotoxicity and prooxidant status in
chronically ethanol-treated rats.

Capa, Istanbul, Turkey.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether high methionine (HM) diet
may influence the development of ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity and
prooxidant-antioxidant balance in the liver. Rats received drinking water
containing ethanol (20% v/v) and/or methionine supplemented diet (2% w/w) for 75 
days. Although prooxidant-antioxidant balance did not change in the liver of rats
in HM group, ethanol treatment was observed to increase plasma transaminase
activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) levels, but not
glutathione (GSH), vitamin E and vitamin C levels, and superoxide dismutase
(SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST)
activities in the liver of rats as compared to controls. However, ethanol plus HM
diet caused further increases in plasma transaminase activities and hepatic MDA
and PC levels. In addition, SOD, GSH-Px and GST activities were observed to
decrease, but GSH, vitamin E and vitamin C levels remained unchanged in the liver
as compared to ethanol, HM and control groups. Our results show that HM diet may 
augment hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in the liver of chronically
ethanol-treated rats.

Systemic mastocytosis presenting with a prominent B lymphocyte proliferation in
the bone marrow and extensive fibrosis of the spleen.

Systemic mastocytosis is a disease characterized by multifocal mast cell
proliferation in the bone marrow or other extracutaneous organs. Because of
loosely scattered and hypo-/agranular mast cells, the diagnosis is sometimes very
difficult. In the bone marrow, mast cell infiltration may be associated with
prominent lymphoid infiltration leading to a misdiagnosis of a low grade
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A 49-year-old woman presented with right arm and leg pain, 
psychiatric symptoms, and diarrhea for four years. Physical examination and
laboratory investigation revealed hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, mild
thrombocytosis, mild leucocytosis and lymphocytosis. In the bone marrow biopsy,
there was a prominent B lymphocyte proliferation reminiscent of a low grade
non-Hodgkin lymphoma/leukemia and there were some spindle cells aggregates in
paratrabecular location. The consecutive bone marrow biopsies were similar to the
first. The subsequent splenectomy specimen exhibited striking fibrosis. In the
lymph node sections, there was marginal zone hyperplasia. Multifocal
accumulations of mast cells were strongly positive with mast cell tryptase and
CD117 on immunohistochemical staining, though no metachromasia was identified in 
Giemsa and Toluidine Blue stained aspirates and tissue sections, probably due to 
hypo-/agranulation of mast cells. The case was presented to emphasize the
importance of the antibody to mast cell tryptase in the diagnosis of mastocytosis
and to discuss problems of differential diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis.

Lipoprotein lipase gene PvuII polymorphism serum lipids and risk for coronary
artery disease: meta-analysis.

Cagatay P(1), Susleyici-Duman B, Ciftci C.

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Department of
Biostatistics, Istanbul, Turkey.

Our aim was to determine whether lipoprotein lipase gene PvuII polymorphism can
be considered as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) by 
conducting a meta-analysis of all available published trials, including our own
study. In 7 seperate studies, 3289 subjects were screened for this substitution; 
meta-analysis included only some of these individuals. Among the 7 studies, 6
were performed on white subjects, whereas 1 was on patients with Saudi Arabic
descent.Subgroup analysis indicated that individuals with PvuII substitution does
not have an increased risk for CAD. The LPL-PvuII genotype and allele frequency
distributions did not differ significantly between CAD patients and healthy
controls. There was no difference in the distribution of LPL-PvuII genotypes
between the healthy subjects and the patients with CAD. However, no significant
differences in lipid variables (triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol) were determined
for the PvuII polymorphisms in the patients with CAD. No significant differences 
were found in serum triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels for LPL-PvuII
genotypes when the control and CAD groups were pooled. In conclusion, LPL-Pvu II 
polymorphism cannot be used as independent genetic risk factor for CAD.

Liver, spleen, trunk kidney, gills, and brain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) were examined histologically after exposure to different concentrations
of methiocarb (2.5 and 3.75 mg/L) or endosulfan (0.6 and 1.3 micro g/L) for 21
days. Histological recovery was also studied by maintaining the pesticide-exposed
fish in a freshwater system for an additional 30 d. Lesions were not evident in
liver, kidney, spleen, or brain of fish exposed to either concentration of
methiocarb for 21 d. Lesions were observed in gills, liver, spleen, and trunk
kidney (but not brain) of rainbow trout exposed to either concentration of
endosulfan. There was no concentration-related effect observed on the
histopathological lesions. After 30 days of recovery, fish had no histological
lesions in gills, kidney, spleen, liver, or brain. Therefore all the changes
observed during exposure were reversible.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the kidney or perirenal soft tissue
is a rare benign lesion that can mimic a malignant renal neoplasm. We describe
the case of a 51-year-old woman that had originally been misdiagnosed as renal
cell carcinoma in another hospital. Histologic re-evaluation of the tumor in our 
institution showed that it was in fact an IMT. Awareness of this entity is
required for rendering the accurate diagnosis. An association with inflammatory
infiltrate, frequent erythrocyte extravasations, edematous or myxoid stroma,
absence of atypical mitosis, and the results of a detailed immunohistochemical
panel might help in the differential diagnosis. Our patient is recurrence-free in
the 18th month of post-operative follow-up.

Ectopic lesions as potential pitfalls in fine needle aspiration cytology: a
report of 3 cases derived from the thyroid, endometrium and breast.

Paksoy N(1).

Author information: 
(1)Cytopathology Laboratory, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey. citographica@superonline.com

BACKGROUND: Ectopic lesions are rarely encountered. Those that are derived from
thyroid, breast, endometrium and salivary glands present with palpable masses
that can mimic malignancy. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a practical 
procedure for the differential diagnosis of such lesions but can reveal
surprising images for a cytopathologist.
CASES: Three cases of discrete, ectopic lesions at different locations occurred. 
Case 1 was a 27-year-old woman. Upon diagnosis of a submandibular mass with a
diameter of 1 cm, FNAC was performed. The smears showed crowded thyroid
follicular cells comprising papillary clusters. A cytologic diagnosis of
papillary thyroid lesion was rendered, Histopathology revealed that this lesion
was ectopic thyroid tissue with focal chronic thyroiditis. Case 2 was a
38-year-old woman who presented with a painful mass with a diameter of 2.5 cm in 
the abdominal wall. The patient had undergone cesarean section 3 years earlier.
The case was diagnosed on FNAC as low grade malignancy in which an
adenocarcinoma/mesenchymal tumor distinction could not be made. The pathologic
examination revealed endometriosis. Case 3 was a 31-year old woman who presented 
with a palpable nodule in the axillary region with a diameter of 1 cm. The
patient had given birth 1 month earlier and was nursing. An FNAC diagnosis of
lactation ectopic breast tissue was made. The mass disappeared by the end of
lactation.
CONCLUSION: FNAC of ectopic lesions may prove to be a diagnostic pitfall for
cytopathologists. A cytopathologist who encounters a cellularpicturefrom a lesion
that is outside the normal anatomic location must use a cautious diagnostic
approach. Unless there are clear findings, the cytopathologist must refrain from 
a diagnosis of malignancy.

Overproduction of free radicals is important in the pathogenesis of the cerebral 
damage induced by ischemia reperfusion. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester, an active
component of propolis extract, exhibits antioxidant properties. The study was
carried out in 16 male Wistar albino rats, divided into two groups: ischemia
reperfusion and ischemia reperfusion with caffeic acid phenethyl ester. The
middle cerebral artery was occluded for 60 min with an intraluminal suture,
followed by 24-h reperfusion. In this study, widespread infarcted areas, red
neurons (eosinophilic degeneration), pyknotic cells, vacuolization and neuroglial
cell infiltration were observed in the cerebral cortex in the ischemia
reperfusion group. In the caffeic acid phenethyl ester group, slightly infarcted 
areas were observed and neuroglial cell infiltration was not determined.
Congestion of choroid plexus and pia mater was found more severe in the ischemia 
reperfusion group than in the caffeic acid phenethyl ester group. In the caffeic 
acid group, neuroglial cell activation was rare. Vacuolization, an indication of 
brain edema, was prevented by caffeic acid phenethyl ester. In the present study,
we showed that pre-treatment with a single i.p. injection of caffeic acid
phenethyl ester at 50 microM/kg dose reduced the structural changes.

To extend our understanding of potential stepwise genetic alterations that may
underlie tumor progression from low-grade astrocytomas to glioblastomas,
histopathologic and comparative genomic hybridization analyses were performed on 
tumor specimens from 68 primary lesions, including 40 glioblastomas, 10

increased towards the higher grade tumors (grade II: 1.66+/-1.49; grade III:
2.80+/-1.68; grade IV: 3.02+/-1.07; F=6.955, p=0.002). A gain of 7/7q was common 
and the most frequently seen aberration in low-grade astrocytomas, whereas loss
of 10q was the most frequently seen anomaly in anaplastic astrocytomas and
glioblastomas. Chromosome 7p amplification was only detected in glioblastomas.
Chromosome 10/10q deletion and combination of 1p, 19q and 17p deletions were
specific to high-grade astrocytic tumors. Sequences of chromosome 7 and 10 seem
to have pivotal roles in the biology of human gliomas. The genomic copy deletions
of chromosomes 1p and 19q might provide an alternative mechanism in the genesis
of astrocytomas.

Lipedematous scalp (LS) is a rare condition of unknown etiology characterized by 
a thick, boggy scalp that occurs mostly in adult black females. The main
pathologic finding consists of increased thickness of scalp resulting from
thickening of the subcutaneous fat layer. Nevus lipomatosus superficialis (NLS)
is an uncommon hamartomatous skin tumor characterized by soft, yellowish papules,
or cerebriform plaques, usually localized on the buttock or thigh. Here, we
report a 46-year-old woman who has NLS localized on the occipital area,
accompanied by LS just beneath and peripheral area of this plaque. The diagnoses 
of NLS and LS were established by histopathological examination. In addition, the
increase in subcutaneous fat layer was demonstrated using magnetic resonance
imaging. The presented patient is the first case showing colocalization of NLS
and LS.

Solitary fibrous tumors are rare spindle cell neoplasms usually arising in the
pleura. They have, however, also been reported at extrapleural locations.
Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the kidney is rare. Despite its rarity,
histological diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis
with other more aggressive tumors arising in the kidney. We report a solitary
fibrous tumor of the left kidney that presented as a malignant tumor in a
51-year-old woman, and include clinical and radiographic findings. The tumor was 
well circumscribed and composed of spindle cells in a collagenous stroma.
Immunohistochemistry showed reactivity for vimentin, CD 34, BCL-2 protein and
CD99. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin, S-100, desmin, alpha-smooth
muscle actin and HMB-45 were negative. A diagnosis of SFT was made based on light
microscopy and immunohistochemistry.

The protooncogene c-kit encoding transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor protein
plays an important role in the signal transduction pathway that regulates
cellular growth and repair. Gene product KIT overexpression has been shown in a
number of different neoplasms, particularly in mastocytosis and gastrointestinal 
stromal tumours (GIST). The morphologic similarity of uterine mesenchymal tumours
and GIST, and the presence of KIT protein in normal uterine tissue, suggests that
uterine sarcomas may have the same c-kit overexpression. The purpose of this
study was to determine the overexpression of c-kit protein in uterine and ovarian
sarcomas. Immunohistochemical staining using a polyclonal anti-c-kit antibody was
performed on tissue blocks from 12 carsinosarcomas, 14 leiomyosarcomas, 8
endometrial stromal sarcomas, 2 adenosarcomas, 1 atypical leiomyoma, 1 leiomyoma 
with limited experience, and 10 leiomyomas. The slides were evaluated by a
semiquantitative method. C-kit was positive in 10 of 12 (83%) carcinosarcomas, 10
of 14 (71%) leiomyosarcomas, 6 of 8 75(%) endometrial stromal sarcomas, 1 of 2
(50%) adenosarcomas, 1 leiomyoma with limited experience, and 1 of 10 (10%)
leiomyomas. The uterine sarcomas express c-kit, like GISTs. It seems that KIT may
have a significant role in the oncogenesis of mesenchymal tumours of the uterus
and ovary.

Procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide shows left ventricular hypertrophy
and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients.

Turkey. mdemir@cu.edu.tr

BACKGROUND: An excess of myocardial collagens in hypertension is a result of
increased collagen synthesis and unchanged or decreased collagen degradation.
Increased collagen content, which is shown by the procollagen type I
carboxy-terminal peptide (PIP), promotes cardiac remodeling and function
abnormalities.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess PIP levels as a marker of
myocardial collagen synthesis and to investigate the relationship between PIP
levels and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) as well as diastolic function in
patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.
METHODS: The study subjects were divided into three groups: healthy subjects
(Group I, n=30); hypertensive patients without left ventricular hypertrophy
(Group II, n=30); and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (Group III,
n=30). Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed by standard
echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging. Serum PIP was measured by
radioimmunoassay.
RESULTS: The serum concentration of PIP was higher in Group III than in Groups I 
and II (P<.001). A positive correlation was found between serum PIP and LVMI in
hypertensive patients (r=.57, P<.001). Patients with diastolic dysfunction (DD)
had significantly higher PIP levels as compared with patients without DD
(177.3+/-52.25 vs. 138.8+/-38.0 microg/L, P<.001). The cutoff values of PIP to
predict left ventricular hypertrophy and DD were 155.0 microg/L (sensitivity,
84%; specificity, 73%) and 150.2 microg/L (sensitivity, 71%; specificity, 70%),
respectively.
CONCLUSION: An elevated serum concentration of PIP shows left ventricular
hypertrophy and DD in the course of hypertension and may be used to follow up on 
the efficacy of the antihypertensive treatment used.

Immunohistochemical expression of PTEN in normal, hyperplastic and malignant
endometrium and its correlation with hormone receptors, bcl-2, bax, and apoptotic
index.

PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in type I endometrioid
endometrial carcinomas (EECs), and is involved in the control of cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to assess 
the relationship between PTEN expression and estrogen, progesterone receptors
(PRs), other apoptosis-related proteins, such as bcl-2 and bax, and apoptotic
index (AI) in EEC, its precursor lesion hyperplasia, and cyclical endometrium. We
also evaluated the relationship between PTEN expression and clinicopathologic
parameters. PTEN, estrogen receptor (ER), PR, and bcl-2 and bax expressions were 
evaluated immunohistochemically, and AI was evaluated in hematoxylin and eosin
(HE)-stained slides in 23 cyclical and 37 hyperplastic endometria and in 35 EECs.
PTEN expression was higher in cyclical endometrium than in the carcinomas
(p<0.05). The PTEN expression level was significantly higher in non-atypical
hyperplasias than in EEC, but there were no differences between atypical complex 
hyperplasia (ACH) and EEC and between hyperplasias. In the carcinomas, there was 
a negative correlation between grade and PTEN expression (r=-0.338, p=0.047). In 
conclusion, we presume that PTEN is involved in the early phases of endometrial
tumorigenesis, and it can be speculated that decreased PTEN expression with loss 
of differentiation in carcinoma can contribute to the emergence of tumors with a 
more aggressive phenotype.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to test multidimensional properties of oral 
health impact profile-14 (OHIP-14) in Behcet's disease (BD) and recurrent
aphthous stomatitis (RAS) patients with active oral ulcers.
METHODS: Ninety-six BD patients, 28 patients with RAS and 117 healthy controls
(HC) were included in this study. In patients with active oral ulcers, the
frequency and healing time of ulcers were recorded. Multidimensional properties
of OHIP-14 were examined by factor analysis.
RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed three subscales and explained 66.49% of overall
variance in these patients with active oral ulcers. The score of Subscale 1 was
positively correlated with the recurrence of oral ulcers per month (P = 0.037).
Subscale 3 scores of the patients treated with colchicine were worse than those
treated with immunosuppressives (P = 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: The factor structure of OHIP-14 was found to be reliable and
sensitive to clinical parameters and treatment modalities in active patients.

    J Cutan Pathol. 2008 Mar;35(3):346.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory dermatosis.
Disorders in keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and immune
dysregulation are the major factors implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis
vulgaris.
METHODS: The study was performed in skin specimens of 25 patients with psoriasis 
vulgaris and a control group of 10 individuals without a skin disease. Biopsy
specimens from lesional and normal skin were analyzed by immunohistochemical
method for expressions of Ki-67, Bcl-2, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL), tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-alpha) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). In addition, densities 
of mast cell infiltration were also investigated.
RESULTS: Ki-67 and TUNEL indexes and TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB expressions were
significantly higher in psoriatic epidermis than in normal epidermis (p < 0.05). 
There was no significant difference at Bcl-2 reactivity between the normal and
the psoriatic epidermis (p > 0.05); however, Bcl-2 staining intensity of
lymphocytes was higher in psoriatic lesions than in normal dermis (p < 0.05).
Additionally, the number of mast cells was significantly higher in psoriatic
dermis than in normal skin (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There were several complex factors involved in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis. We conclude that cellular damage and apoptosis temporarily coincide
with epidermal proliferation during the course of psoriatic hyperplasia.

BACKGROUND: Because antigen presenting is necessary for T-cell activation,
antigen-presenting cells should be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In 
this study, our purpose was to evaluate and compare effects of PUVA, cyclosporine
A and narrow-band UVB on dendritic cells and activated lymphocytes in the
psoriatic lesions.
METHODS: Forty-five volunteered patients (15 patients in each treatment group as 
PUVA, cyclosporin A and narrow-band UVB) were enrolled in this study. Lesional
skin biopsies were taken from each patient before and after treatments. Fresh
frozen biopsies were studied for the expressions of CD1a, CD68, CD86, CD4, CD8
and HLA-DR proteins by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: There was no correlation between severity of the lesions and expressions
of the antigens. Only PUVA significantly decreased CD1a+ epidermal Langerhans
cells' (LCs) counts. Treatment modalities decreased expression of costimulator
CD86, and most of them decrease antigen-presenting capacity of skin by decreasing
HLA class-II expression.
CONCLUSIONS: All treatment modalities equally reduce lymphocytes, macrophages and
dendritic cells. PUVA is the only treatment that decreases epidermal LCs. All
treatments effectively diminish expression of CD86 and inhibit this step of
inflammation.

Malignant granular cell tumor with unusual histological features.

Behzatoğlu K(1), Bahadir B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Istanbul Educational and Research Hospital, Ministry 
of Health, Istanbul, Turkey.

Malignant granular cell tumor, although uncommon, should be differentiated from a
number of granular cell-containing tumors. Reported herein is a distinctive
variant of malignant granular cell tumor, clinically presenting as a rapidly
enlarging scrotal mass, in which some areas morphologically displayed features
indistinguishable from Kaposi sarcoma. Cells in areas simulating Kaposi sarcoma
were immunohistochemically the same as typical granular cells in other portions
of the tumor. The recognition of this pattern is important because it may
predominate and overshadow the original nature of tumor.

Elastofibroma is a rare fibrous lesion characterized by accumulated abnormal
elastic fibers whose etiology remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed
seven cases of elastofibroma to further explore the characteristics of its
cellular composition. Immunohistochemistry was performed for mast cell tryptase, 
S-100 protein, vimentin, CD34, smooth muscle actin, desmin and collagen type IV. 
Histochemical staining methods for Gomori's trichrome and Verhoeff elastica-van
Gieson were also evaluated. Histopathologically, a haphazard array of collagen,
eosinophilic amorphous fibers, and globules in a fibrous tissue was seen. The
elastic nature of the fibers was confirmed by elastic stain, and with Gomori's
trichrome collagen fibers were also demonstrated. The interspersed spindle or
stellate cells were almost consistently positive for vimentin and frequently
positive for CD34. Mast cell tryptase-positive cells were present in five of the 
cases. Collagen type IV immunoreactivity was seen in two cases. No staining was
observed with smooth muscle actin, desmin or S-100 protein. Our findings suggest 
that CD34-positive mesenchymal cells are an integral component of elastofibroma.

Myointimoma is a recently described benign tumor, which is regarded as a rare
type of mesenchymal tumor of the penis. The present patient was a 50-year-old man
who had a nodule located in the glans penis. He had a 2 month history of a mass. 
An excisional biopsy was performed. The histological findings revealed a
multinodular tumor that was characterized by spindle-shaped cells located in the 
intravascular area. This case, in addition to 11 cases reported in the
literature, demonstrates that the myointimoma is frequently misdiagnosed on
clinical and pathological grounds because of its rarity. Histological and
immunohistochemical features are summarized on the basis of the present case and 
previously published reports.

Polymastia is a term that is used to describe the presence of more than two
breasts in human beings. It is synonymous with supernumerary or accessory breast 
tissue. In the ectopic breast tissue any disease can develop that affects the
normal breast, including fibroadenoma. We reported a case of fibroadenoma of the 
axilla in a 23-year-old woman. Differential diagnosis of an axillary mass should 
also include fibroadenoma in an ectopic breast tissue.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes that code for coagulation factors V 
(factor V Leiden) and II (prothrombin, G20210A), as well as the
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, C677T) gene, have been implicated in 
the majority of cases of hereditary thrombophilia. We have developed a multiplex 
PCR-RFLP assay based on MnlI endonuclease digestion for the simultaneous
detection of mutations in the FV, FII, and MTHFR genes. Digested amplification
products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a single gel lane and visualized
by ethidium bromide. This approach is a rapid and convenient method, hence
economic, that alternate to others described for the detection of FVL, G20210A
and C677T mutations.

Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic cadmium administration induces
oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the possible therapeutic 
effect of adrenomedullin, a potent antioxidant, in cadmium-induced morphological,
ultrastructural and biochemical alterations. Two groups of rats were exposed to
100 ppm of CdCl(2) in drinking water for four weeks. One of these groups received
3000 ng/kg body weight of adrenomedullin (AdM) intraperitoneally during the last 
week. Hepatic oxidative stress markers were evaluated by changes in the amount of
lipid peroxides and changes in the antioxidant enzyme activities, superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GSH) 
levels. Hepatic damage score was significantly higher in Cd-administered rats
than those of controls (p<0.005). Cd-induced ultrastructural changes in
hepatocytes included focal parenchymal cell necrosis, dilatation of rough
endoplasmic reticulum, proliferation of lysosomes and mitochondrial degeneration.
Hepatic damage was accompanied by significant increase in tissue MDA level
(p<0.05) and significant decrease in tissue GSH level (p<0.05), and SOD and GPx
activities (p>0.05, p>0.005, respectively). Adrenomedullin failed to restore the 
light and electron microscopic, and biochemical changes. We conclude that
although we administered a high dose of adrenomedullin, it failed to reduce
cadmium-induced hepatic damage probably because of the irreversibility of
Cd-induced hepatic injury.

A 64-year-old woman with upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting was admitted.
The magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked dilation and "crowding" of the
segment 4 bile ducts with an area suspicious for a stone or tumor.
Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography revealed
multiple filling defects in the segment 4 bile ducts, the left and common hepatic
ducts. A left hepatectomy and cholecystectomy was performed. Dilated bile ducts
containing mucinous material and a mass in the cystically dilated bile ducts of
segment 4 were detected in the gross examination. It showed continuity within the
surrounding dilated bile ducts. The dilated bile ducts of the segments 2 and 3
contained mucinous material without any apparent mass formation. Microscopically,
the bile ducts were lined by biliary epithelium displaying simple and complex
papillary structures with moderate to severe degree of dysplastic changes. The
mass was composed of complex papillary structures filling the bile duct with a
few foci of invasion. The papillary structures were composed of mucin-producing
columnar cells as well as cells with oncocytic appearance. Patchy cytokeratin 7, 
cytokeratin 19, hepatocyte paraffin 1, MUC2, and CDX2 immunopositivities were
observed. Biliary papillomatosis, mucin-producing intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, and intraductal papillary-type peripheral cholangiocarcinoma 
are in the same disease spectrum of papillary biliary neoplasm and termed as
intraductal papillary neoplasm of the liver. Mucinous hypersecretion and signs of
mucobilia are considered specific and should raise the suspicion of lesions in
this spectrum.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is an extremely rare hereditary genetic
disease of autosomal recessive transmission that is characterized by large
cutaneous tumors commonly involving the scalp, papulonodular skin lesions,
flexural joint contractures, gingival hyperplasia, and osteolytic bone lesions.
JHF is usually diagnosed in young infants and in children younger than 5 years,
and the lesions characteristic of this disorder consist of fibrous tissue and
homogenous amorphous eosinophilic hyaline material. We report the case of a
9-year-old girl with severe gingival hyperplasia, nasal enlargement, mild
osteoporosis, and multiple papulonodular skin lesions. Her two brothers (7 and 13
years of age, respectively) were also diagnosed as having JHF. In the patient
described in this report, the maintenance of oral hygiene after gingivectomy
enabled the continued resolution of gingival hyperplasia, although skin lesions
recurred and nasal overgrowth persisted.

Disseminated candidiasis is relatively common in immunocompromised patients. The 
treatment protocol of these patients usually includes broad-spectrum antibiotics 
and also emprical antifungals initiated due to unresponsiveness to antibiotics.
In this study the efficacies of caspofungin and meropenem - separately and
together - in mice with disseminated candidiasis were studied. Immunocompetent
mice were infected intravenously with 2x10(6) CFU of Candida albicans. At 24 h
postinfection, intraperitoneal therapy was initiated and was continued for 7
days. Therapy groups included those given caspofungin (0.5, 1.25, 5 mg/kg/day),
meropenem (20 mg/kg/day), and a combination of the two drugs. The outcome of
therapy was evaluated by kidney tissue burden studies and histologic examination.
In vitro, drug susceptibilities were tested by checkerboard analysis. Kidney CFU 
counts showed that mice that had received both drugs had lower residual burdens. 
Caspofungin was effective at doses of 0.5, 1.25, 5 mg/kg compared to infected
untreated controls. In vitro, MICs of caspofungin and meropenem were <0.075 micro
g/ml and >64 micro g/ml, respectively. Synergism was observed with the
combination. Histopathology showed that the degree of inflammation was 25% less
and tubular necrosis was more restricted in combined therapy than monotherapy.
The results indicate that concurrent caspofungin and meropenem therapy may be
beneficial.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may cause neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), and
chylomicron metabolism may be destroyed in injured lungs. We aimed to investigate
the effect of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), if present, on the development of
cerebral fat embolism. This study has been conducted on 20 rabbits. Experimental 
SAH has been applied to half of the animals by injecting homologous blood into
the cisterna magna, and the remaining half was applied only isotonic saline
solution in the same manner under general anesthesia. After 20 days, all animals 
were killed. Their lungs and brains were examined histopathologically. Six
animals died of SAH between 16 and 20 days, and foamy hemorrhagic parenchymal
lesions and intra-alveolar hemorrhage were observed in their lungs. Fat globules 
were abundantly found in cerebral arteries of six of all the non-surviving
animals. But, minimal histopathological changes were found in the lungs and
brains of the surviving animals. Cerebral fat embolism was detected in only one
animal that was given isotonic solution. SAH may cause NPE and result in lung
tissue destruction. Chylomicron metabolism may be disordered in the destructed
lungs and leakage of chylomicrons into systemic circulation may be facilitated
via destroyed lung barrier. These pathologic processes may lead to cerebral fat
embolism.

The study group was derived from the archival materials of 48 invasive
intraductal breast cancer patients who had undergone partial mastectomy/ axillary
dissection. All patients included in the study had clinically T1-2N0M0 invasive
ductal carcinoma. To detect HER-2/neu status, fluorescent in situ hybridization
was performed using a HER-2/neu locus-specific probe. Signals were counted and
patients were classified in three groups according to signal ratios: signal ratio
<2, group 1 (n=31); signal ratio 2-4, group 2 (n=11); signal ratio >4, group 3
(n=6). Ratios of axillary metastatic lymph nodes to dissected total lymph nodes
were 17%, 23% and 83% in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (P=0.003). The number of 
metastatic axillary lymph nodes, and the ratio of microscopic metastatic lymph
nodes were highest in group 3 (P=0.001 and P=0.008, respectively). No significant
difference was observed between groups for distant metastasis in a 5-year
follow-up period. Signal ratios decreased with estrogen receptor expression
(P=0.03). Histopathologically, an irregular growth pattern of the tumor was
observed in 100% of the patients in group 3, and in 54% and 60% in groups 1 and
2, respectively (P=0.04). Lymphovascular invasion of the tumor was significantly 
higher in group 3 compared to the other two groups (P=0.01). The extensive
intraductal component ratio was the highest in group 3 (P=0.04). The appearance
of desmoplastic reaction and lymphocyte infiltration did not show significant
difference between the groups. Our results show that HER-2/neu signal ratio
increases with lymphovascular invasion, an extensive intraductal component,
irregular growth pattern and axillary metastasis in clinically T1-2N0M0 invasive 
ductal carcinoma of the breast.

Examination of bcl-2 and p53 expressions and apoptotic index by TUNEL method in
psoriasis.

Author information: 
(1)School of Medicine, Celal Bayar University, Turkey. turankamer@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is characterised by hyperproliferation and by aberrant
differentiation. Blockage of the normal apoptotic process is one of the factors
implicated in the pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the apoptotic features by using TUNEL method and also
bcl-2 and p53 expressions in psoriatic epidermis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies of 35 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 14
normal skin were evaluated. Apoptotic cells were detected using the dUTP nick-end
labelling assay; bc1-2 and p53 expressions were assessed by using
immunohistochemical techniques. A semi-quantitative grading system (HSCORE) was
used for comparison.
RESULTS: Bcl-2 was strongly expressed in basal keratinocytes of normal skin,
while no expression was observed in 13 (37.2%) of the psoriatic samples and it
was weakly expressed in the spinous cell layer of 22 (62.8%) samples. Moderate
p53 expression was observed in the psoriasis group, while it was weak in the
control. The percentage of TUNEL positive cells were significantly increased in
the psoriasis group (65+/-2.30) when compared with the control (32.84+/-7.16).
CONCLUSION: Apoptotic index besides bc1-2 and p53 expressions in psoriasis differ
from normal epidermis. Down-regulation of bc1-2 is consistent with the dynamics
of psoriasis but increased TUNEL positive cells and p53 expression has not been
fully elucidated yet. Gündüz K, Demireli P, Vatansever S, Inanir I. Examination

Cyclosporine A (CsA), broadly used in organ transplantation, may contribute to
pathogenesis of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the
effects of CsA on alveolar bone in rats subjected or not to experimental
periodontal disease using biochemical, radiographic, and histometric analysis.
Forty Wistar rats were divided into 4 equal groups: Group I (Control), Group II
(CsA was injected subcutaneously in a daily dose of 10 mg/kg), Group III
(Ligature was placed around the mandibular molars), Group IV (Ligature+CsA).
After 60 days, rats were decapitated, serum alkaline phosphatase and calcium
levels were measured. Radiographic-alveolar bone loss (ABL), histometric-ABL, and
percentage of new alveolar bone formation (NABF%) were determined on mandibular
molars. Significant increase in serum alkaline phosphatase levels (p < 0.001), no
significant difference in calcium levels were observed (p > 0.05) in Group IV
compared to Group III. Radiographic and histometric-ABL were significantly less
(p < 0.001), NABF% was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in Group IV than in Group
III. No significant difference in any of the parameters between Group II and
Group I was found. It can be concluded that in the presence of periodontal
disease, CsA treatment may bring out an imbalance in the alveolar bone
homeostasis by decreasing resorption and stimulating formation of alveolar bone
in rats.

Image analysis as an adjunct to sodium rhodizonate test in the evaluation of
gunshot residues: an experimental study.

It is important to investigate the clothing, as well as the body, to determine
the range of fire of entry wounds in firearm injuries. Clothing can affect the
amount of gunshot residues (GSR) reaching the body and their distribution. The
amount and distribution of the GSR also vary according to the distance between
the firearm and the target. Sodium rhodizonate test provides valuable data when
clothing is available for examination. In the absence of clothing, light
microscopic examinations may add additional information regarding the range of
fire. In this study, a sodium rhodizonate test was done on 80 garment samples
containing the bullet entrance. The 80 calfskin samples were processed
histologically and were stained using Alizarin Red S. These were also evaluated
with computer-assisted image analysis. Gross residues were seen on military
camouflage clothing in samples from < or = 45-cm group. White flannel undershirts
under the military camouflage contained rhodizonate-positive particles only
around the contact wounds. With image analysis, however, the residues could be
detected also in the skin samples of the 2.5-cm- and 5-cm-range groups. We
suggest that the image analysis can be combined with other techniques and it can 
provide valuable data in the determination of entry wounds and also in the
estimation of firing distance.

BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a chronic, systemic granulomatous disease of unknown
etiology that features noncaseating granulomas in many body regions. Sinonasal
involvement is rare but is also suspected to be underreported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who was
incidentally diagnosed with isolated sarcoidosis involving the middle turbinates.
Histopathologic examination of resected concha bullosa material and an extensive 
panel of diagnostic tests revealed a diagnosis of isolated sarcoidosis. Since no 
systemic manifestations were detected, topical corticosteroid (nasal spray) was
administered in the postoperative period. Throughout the 12 months after surgery,
the patient remained free of symptoms and all nasal endoscopy examinations were
normal.
CONCLUSION: Although isolated nasal involvement of sarcoidosis is rare,
otorhinolaryngologists should consider this condition in a differential diagnosis
for sinonasal complaints.

We present a case report of a 28-year-old man with a huge tumor that occupies
both dilated atria almost completely but not extending into the ventricles.
Cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma (CR) is extremely rare in adult patients. Its rarity and
heterogenous clinical presentation make diagnosis difficult. In our case, after
we have made an initial diagnosis via echocardiography, we took biopsies under
computed tomography (CT) guiding. Histologic examination showed a CR. We want to 
emphasize that CT-guided biopsy is a useful and applicable technique in
establishing preoperative diagnosis of intracardiac masses.

Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The apoptosis of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in
patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not well understood. The goal of this 
study was to examine the apoptosis of PMNs in patients with SCD and in controls.
METHODS: Flow cytometric quantitation of PMN apoptosis was performed in 17
patients during and after sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis and in 17 healthy
volunteers. Plasma nitric oxide concentrations were also measured in patients
with SCD.
RESULTS: The mean of annexin-V and annexin-V/PI staining (early and late
apoptotic cells) increased to a greater degree in patients with SCD than in
healthy controls for patients with SCD during and after vasoocclusive crisis. The
mean of PI staining showing dead cells was higher only in patients after SCD
crisis than in healthy controls. In the SCD groups during and after vasoocclusive
crisis, there was no difference between PMN apoptosis levels. Furthermore, plasma
nitric oxide concentrations were not correlated with PMN apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an evidence that the alteration of blood PMN apoptosis
could contribute to the pathogenetic mechanisms of vasoocclusion in patients with
SCD. This can be attributed to the effects of numerous inflammatory mediators
rather than simply the effects of nitric oxide.

Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis are endemic in the western and southeastern 
parts of Turkey. We report a sporadic case of visceral leishmaniasis from
Kocaeli, which is not an endemic area. The patient, a 10-month-old male infant,
had since birth never been outside the city. He was referred to our hospital with
a one-month history of fever. Antibiotics were administered but fever persisted. 
There were Leishman bodies in the bone marrow aspirate, both in macrophages and
in clusters among other cells. Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) detected
no antibodies in the mother. Liposomal amphotericin B was administered. Visceral 
leishmaniasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with
persistant fever, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia, even in nonendemic areas.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a DNA hybridization test (Affirm VPIII)
as an alternative to Gram stain for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in
women with clinical signs of vaginal infection. Vaginal specimens were collected 
from 321 symptomatic women, and analyzed for bacterial vaginosis by both Gram
stain using Nugent criteria and DNA hybridization test. Sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the DNA hybridization
test were determined using the Gram staining as the standard for diagnosis of
bacterial vaginosis. Of the 321 patients, 115 (35.8%) were Gram positive for
bacterial vaginosis and 126 (39.2%) were negative. 80 patients (25.0%)
demonstrated intermediate Gram staining that was also considered negative. The
Affirm system detected G. vaginalis in 107 (93.0%) of 115 vaginal specimens
positive for bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by Gram stain. Compared to the Gram
stain, DNA hybridization test had a sensitivity of 87.7% and a specificity of
96.0%. Positive and negative predictive values of the DNA hybridization test were
93.0% and 92.7%, respectively. In conclusion, Affirm VPIII hybridization test
correlated well with Gram stain and may be used as a rapid diagnostic tool to
exclude bacterial vaginosis in women with genital complaints.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the
phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated proliferation and average RNA content in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Down syndrome (DS) patients change
with age.
METHOD: Stimulated portion of PBMC and total RNA levels in these cells after 72 h
of PHA stimulation from 38 DS patients were compared with 28 age-matched healthy 
controls using flow cytometric measurement.
RESULTS: Decreased ratio of PBMC from DS patients undergoes mitogenic stimulation
with age (r = -0.84, P = 0.000). This decrease is not observed in the cells of
control individuals (r = 0.03, P = 0.869). Stimulated PBMC in infants with DS
have higher level of RNA contents compared to controls (Z = 2.227, P = 0.026).
While RNA content in mitogen-stimulated PBMC of DS decreased progressively and
significantly with age (r = -0.70, P = 0.000), no significant age-related change 
in RNA content was found among the cells of healthy individuals in the range of
0-27 year old (r = 0.275, P = 0.157, P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Age-dependent decreases in mitogen-activated proliferation ratio and 
average RNA content of PBMC from DS patients appear as regular events. These
results may contribute to the explanation of the immune deficiency seen in DS
patients since the PHA-stimulated cells are principally T-lymphocytes. This is
the first report on the decrease in PHA-stimulated proliferation ratio
(stimulability) and RNA level in PBMC of DS patients in relation to age.

Genetic susceptibility to rheumatic heart disease and streptococcal pharyngitis: 
association with HLA-DR alleles.

Haydardedeoğlu FE(1), Tutkak H, Köse K, Düzgün N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara,
Turkey.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a systemic inflammatory disease that develops as a
consequence of an exaggerated immune response to group A beta-haemolytic
streptococci, which causes pharyngitis. Major manifestations of ARF include
carditis, arthritis and chorea. Several investigators have attempted to establish
a relation between ARF and human leucocyte antigens (HLA). Heterogeneity in
various studies has been found, although associations with certain antigens were 
reported. The aim of this study was to analyse whether HLA-DR alleles play a role
in the resistance or susceptibility to streptococci-related disorders including
rheumatic heart disease (RHD) as a sequela of ARF and recurrent streptococcal
pharyngitis in Turkish patients. The study included 102 patients with RHD, 71
persons with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis and 130 healthy controls. HLA-DR
alleles were typed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence-specific
primers. Positive association with HLA-DRB1*07 allele was found for RHD when
compared with healthy controls [29.4% vs 13.1%; P < 0.01, P-corrected: P < 0.01, 
odds ratio (OR) 2.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-5.26] and also for
recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis (26.8% vs 13.1%; P < 0.05, P-corrected: P <
0.05, OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.17-3.56). The frequency of HLA-DRB1*11 allele was
decreased in patients with RHD (23.5% vs 42.3%; P < 0.01, P-corrected: P < 0.01, 
OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.75). Data suggest that HLA-DRB1*07 allele may be a genetic
factor in increasing the susceptibility to develop RHD and recurrent
streptococcal pharyngitis. HLA-DRB1*11 allele seems to be a protective factor
against RHD.

The prognostic significance of angiogenesis and the effect of vascular
endothelial growth factor on angiogenic process in Wilms' tumour.

Ozluk Y(1), Kilicaslan I, Gulluoglu MG, Ayan I, Uysal V.

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology,

AIMS: There is a subgroup of patients with Wilms' tumour (WT) having favourable
clinicopathological features but adverse outcome. We aimed to investigate the
prognostic significance of angiogenesis and whether it can be used for predicting
which patients will fall into this category, and the possible role of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on angiogenesis in WT.
METHODS: Tumours in nephrectomy specimens from 63 WT patients were investigated
for neovascularisation and VEGF expression by immunohistochemistry. The
endothelial cells were highlighted by anti-CD34 and anti-CD31, and the
microvessels in the hot-spots were counted. Correlations between the microvessel 
density (MVD), VEGF expression, clinicopathological features and prognosis were
studied.
RESULTS: Among 21 patients with follow-up data, favourable histology was detected
in 17, seven of which died of disease. Patients with highly vascular tumours
showed significantly poorer prognosis than those with low vascular tumours. There
was no significant relationship between angiogenesis and VEGF expression. VEGF
immunostaining revealed various patterns in different components of WT.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that high MVD can be used as an indicator of poor
prognosis with WT patients displaying favourable histology and there might be
some additional growth factors other than VEGF which may also be responsible for 
angiogenesis in WTs.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) expression and angiogenesis in intracranial ependymomas.

Onguru O(1), Kurt B, Gunhan O, Soylemezoglu F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Hacettepe
University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. onguruo@yahoo.com

AIM: Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), the inducible key enzyme in the biosynthesis of
prostaglandins, appears to play a role in the regulation of progression,
invasiveness and angiogenesis of various neoplasms including some glial tumors.
Little is known about the role of Cox-2 in angiogenesis and proliferation of
ependymomas. We studied Cox-2 expression, Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) and
microvessel density (MVD) in 30 intracranial ependymomas and analyzed the
relationship among these parameters to evaluate their importance in the tumor
biology of ependymomas.
RESULTS: The mean Ki-67 LI for all tumors ranged from 1 - 50% (mean 9%).
Statistically significant difference was present for Ki-67 LI between ependymomas
(grade II, WHO) and anaplastic ependymomas (grade III, WHO) (p < 0.001) (mean
Ki-67 LI for ependymoma, 2.8%, for anaplastic ependymomas, 15.6%). Anaplastic
ependymomas did not demonstrate a greater vascularization than ependymomas, and
the MVD values were 84.5 +/- 39.7 for ependymomas, and 90.6 +/- 61.4 for
anaplastic ependymomas. Cox-2 immunohistochemical expression was observed in 19
tumors (63%). Although Cox-2 expression was slightly higher in anaplastic
ependymomas, it was not statistically significant. No correlation was found
between Cox-2 expression and MVD and Ki-67 LI.
CONCLUSION: Similar to morphologic and prognostic heterogeneity in ependymomas,
Cox-2 expression, MVD and Ki-67 LI also show a great variability. Other factors
may be more important for the proliferation and angiogenesis of ependymomas.

The histologic findings of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis include
papillomatosis, hyperkeratosis, and minimal or no acanthosis. We present a
patient with the clinical findings of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis
who responded dramatically to azithromycin, but histologic examination did not
reveal papillomatosis. We observed invagination of basket-weave hyperkeratosis
through the epidermis. We considered this finding may give a clue for the
diagnosis of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.

Tumour vascularity is of prognostic significance in adult, but not paediatric
astrocytomas.

Birlik B(1), Canda S, Ozer E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylul University, School of Medicine, Izmir,
Turkey.

Astrocytomas are the commonest type of brain tumours in adults and children.
Although the most reliable prognostic indicators have been shown consistently to 
be patient age and tumour histological grade, biological progression in these
tumours is inevitable and the overall prognosis has remained poor. Due to the
evidence that vascular changes are important histological features of
astrocytomas, the aim of this study was to investigate prognostic significance of
tumour vascularity in paediatric and adult astrocytomas. Study population
consisted of 70 patients (45 adult and 25 children) with histologically proven
diagnosis of astrocytoma with no history of previous therapy. Histological
quantification of tumour vascularity was performed using three different methods:
microvessel density, vascular grading and Chalkley counting. Histological
classification and grading were also assessed using the World Health Organization
system. In contrast to the results in paediatric astrocytomas, tumour vascularity
in adult tumours correlated significantly with postoperative survival by
univariate analysis (P < 0.05). Microvessel density appeared to be an independent
indicator of prognosis by multivariate analysis (P = 0.001). Likewise, patients
with microvessel density of 70 or greater had significantly shorter survival than
the remaining group (P < 0.001). Patient age and tumour histological grade were
also correlated with survival. We conclude that histological quantification of
tumour vascularity is a significant prognosticator in adult astrocytomas, but not
in children. Our data do not support the validity of applications of
antiangiogenic agents in paediatric astrocytic tumours, particularly pilocytic
astrocytomas.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the typing accuracy of
conventional smear (CS), cell block (CB) preparations and combined use of both
procedures (CS + CB) for the diagnosis of hepatic malignancies and to determine
whether immediate on-site cytopathological evaluation improves the diagnostic
yield of liver fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).
METHODS: Ultrasound-guided FNABs were performed on 323 consecutive cases with
liver masses between December 2002 and December 2004. Histologically and/or
clinically correlated 167 cases were included in the study. Preliminary FNAB
results, results of CS, CB, and combined use of CS and CB were compared regarding
diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the diagnosis of
malignancy. Subtyping accuracies of different methods were also compared.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of on-site cytopathological examination and CS were both
92.8%. The sensitivity of CS + CB was slightly better than that of CB (93.5%
versus 84.8%). Specificity of all procedures was achieved 100%. Diagnostic
accuracy of on-site cytopathological evaluation, CS, CB, and CS + CB were 93.9%, 
93.9%, 87.2%, and 94.5%, respectively. A specific subtype diagnosis of malignant 
tumours could be rendered accurately on the basis of preliminary diagnosis in
71%, CS in 75.4%, CB in 78.3% and combined approach in 92% of cases. In terms of 
typing accuracy, 87.5% of HCCs, 93.2% of adenocarcinomas, 92.3% of neuroendocrine
carcinomas, 100% of lymphomas and 100% of other malignant tumours were correctly 
subclassified in the final cytopathological diagnosis. The agreement between
preliminary diagnosis and final cytopathological diagnosis was 77.2%.
CONCLUSION: With use of on-site cytopathological evaluation and combined use of
CS and CB, the diagnostic accuracy of liver tumours approaches 100% and also
significantly improve diagnostic and subtyping accuracy of liver malignancies.

Turkey. handan27@hotmail.com

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of fine needle
aspiration biopsy of the thyroid as a tool for diagnosing amyloid goitre and
assess how amyloidosis affects thyroid tissue and thyroid function.
METHODS: Clinical and laboratory evaluation of 50 patients with secondary
systemic amyloidosis was done, and goitre was found in 38 of them. All 38
patients underwent thyroid aspiration biopsy. Tissue samples were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin, May-Grünwald-Giemsa, crystal violet and Congo red.
RESULTS: Of the 38 cases of amyloid goitre, 10 showed euthyroid sick syndrome,
two showed primary hyperthyroidism, two showed hypothyroidism and one showed
subacute thyroiditis. The serum levels of thyroid hormones and
thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal in the remaining patients. Thirty-five of
the 38 patients (92%) showed amyloidosis after thyroid aspiration. One of these
patients had papillary carcinoma in addition to amyloid goitre. Ten patients
underwent subtotal thyroidectomy, and one patient underwent total thyroidectomy
after aspiration. Microscopic evaluation revealed that the thyroid parenchyma in 
all patients was largely replaced with amyloid and adipose tissue.
CONCLUSION: Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid is a valuable and sensitive
method for diagnosing amyloid goitre, especially because it is a safe and easily 
performed procedure. Further, amyloid goitre has no significant influence on
thyroid function even when it causes extensive parenchyma replacement.

A case of benign granulomas of the conjunctiva in a 3-year-old girl is reported. 
Histologic features of the excised conjunctival lesions were consistent with
Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. This phenomenon is thought to be a granulomatous
reaction to an antigen-antibody precipitate related to parasites or fungi. No
causative agent is identified in our patient. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
no immunoreactivity for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, or the C3 component of 
the complement. We propose that the presence of small amelanotic nodular
conjunctival tumors should arouse suspicion related to the Splendore-Hoeppli
phenomenon even in early childhood.

A 49-year-old female patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
presented with fever, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. While peritoneal fluid
bacterial cultures remained negative, she had no relief after 3 weeks of
broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial peritonitis. In a peritoneal
fluid sample, Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA was detected by nucleic acid
amplification using real-time PCR testing. The initiation of antituberculous
therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) was followed by
resolution of fever and abdominal pain within one week. Nucleic acid
amplification tests can play an important role in the species-specific diagnosis 
of tuberculous peritonitis.

University School of Medicine, Haydarpasa 81326, Istanbul, Turkey.

In order to determine the local epidemiology of candidemia, Candida strains
isolated between 1994 and 2000 were identified to species level; antifungal
resistance patterns and DNA fingerprints were analyzed. Identification of Candida
strains (n: 140) was performed with germ tube test and carbohydrate assimilation 
reactions. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using a commercial
test for 5-flucytosine and the broth macrodilution method according to NCCLS for 
fluconazole and amphotericin B. Molecular relatedness was determined by
restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA followed by probe hybridization.
C. albicans (37.2%), C. parapsilosis (32.2%), and C. tropicalis (12.2%) comprised
114 (81.4%) of 140 isolates. Susceptibility tests did not reveal resistance to
amphotericin B in any of the Candida isolates. Fluconazole resistance was
detected in one isolate of C. krusei, and 5-flucytosine resistance in two C.
tropicalis isolates and one C. albicans isolate. Significantly higher frequency
of clusters with identical strains in C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis was
detected compared to C. albicans. Pediatric wards are particularly important in
the nosocomial transmission of non-albicans candida species.

Development of multiple sclerosis after vaccination against hepatitis B: a study 
based on human leucocyte antigen haplotypes.

The aetiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is still not fully understood.
Infectious agents are believed to play a role in the development of this
multifactorial disease. Cases in which this disease occurs after administration
of both plasma-derived and recombinant hepatitis B vaccines have been reported.
In this study, we compared a group of 11 MS patients who developed first clinical
symptoms after hepatitis B vaccination (group I) with 71 MS patients who were
never vaccinated against hepatitis B and were negative for hepatitis B serology
(group II), and 20 healthy controls (group III). Mean age was 27.75 years (19-39)
in group I, 30.16 years (18-50) in group II, and 34.4 years (18-50) in group III.
Mean attack rate after 2 years was 1.5 in group I and 1.63 in group II. Mean
Expanded Disability Status Scale score after 2 years was 1.31 in group I and 1.89
in group II. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing and serology for hepatitis B
surface antigen were performed in all groups. In groups I and II, HLA-DR2 was
more frequent than in normal healthy subjects. This reflects the general role of 
HLA in the pathogenesis of MS but suggests that antigen presentation by different
HLA is not involved in the development of MS after hepatitis B vaccination. Since
there was no difference in the clinical features between vaccinated and
nonvaccinated MS patients, this study supports recent reports that hepatitis B
vaccination is safe in MS patients and that hepatitis B vaccination is not
involved in the development of MS.

Congenital choledochal cyst is a rarely seen malformation of childhood,
particularly when associated with multiseptate gallbladder or ectopic pancreas.
The current case represents a 15-day-old boy with jaundice. Ultrasonography
suggested a cystic lesion, probably of the common bile duct. The patient
underwent a total excision of type I choledochal cyst and gallbladder with
Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and a wedge biopsy from the liver. Gross examination
revealed multiple septa dividing the gallbladder into multiple compartments. The 
outer and inner surfaces of the choledochal cyst were unremarkable.
Microscopically, the cyst wall was composed of dense fibrous tissue with a single
layer of cubic to columnar cells constituting the overlying epithelium. Serial
sections incidentally revealed ectopic pancreatic tissue lying along the cyst
wall characterized by acini, islets, and ductal structures with endocrine cells
reactive for chromogranin A. Septa dividing the gallbladder were composed of
fibrotic stalks containing smooth muscle fibers. Areas of papillary hyperplasia
and intestinal metaplasia of gallbladder epithelium were also noted. The liver
biopsy specimen demonstrated the presence of intrahepatic bile ducts,
subsequently confirmed by cytokeratin 7. To our knowledge, this case represents
the 1st one associated with these 3 entities and only the 2nd choledochal cyst
with ectopic pancreatic tissue in its wall.

Non-enzymatic glycation of peripheral nerve extracellular matrix (ECM) may
contribute to the development of diabetic distal sensory neuropathy (DNP). We
investigated the relative importance of glycation of collagen types I and IV,
laminin and fibronectin in DNP-related impairment in peripheral nerve
regeneration. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from young adult mice were embedded in
collagen type I modified by 10% substitution with normal or glycated forms of the
proteins and incubated for 3 days. Outgrowth of axons and migration of cells into
the ECM were quantified. Mean length of growing axons was significantly reduced
by glycation of laminin and collagen type IV. The sum of lengths of all axons
from each DRG was greatly reduced with glycated laminin, collagen types IV and I.
Glycation of fibronectin had no effect on axonal growth. The number of migrating 
cells was not affected by glycation. We conclude that non-enzymatic glycation of 
laminin and collagen types IV and I (in decreasing order) impairs peripheral
nerve regeneration in vitro.

Comment in
    Am J Forensic Med Pathol. 2008 Dec;29(4):382-4.

Air guns and blank guns may appear relatively harmless at first glance, but they 
are, in fact, potentially destructive, even lethal, weapons. Approximately 2 to
2.5 million nonpowder firearms are sold annually, and again approximately 12.9
per 100,000 population are treated for such injuries in hospital emergency
departments each year in the United States. Unfortunately, these guns are
considered to be a toy for children. Therefore, incidents of air gun injuries are
gradually increasing. Although such injuries may initially be considered trivial,
it may signify severe internal tissue pathologies. These apparently trivial
injuries may have catastrophic consequences if unnoticed. In this study, we
report 4 cases with head injury due to a shot by these guns. The cases indicate
that these people had used the guns belonging to their parents for the purpose of
suicide. The cases also show that these machines are not innocent.

BACKGROUND: Among intraepidermal malignancies of epithelial origin, Bowen's
disease, bowenoid actinic keratosis (BAK), intraepidermal malignant eccrine
poroma (MEP), and Paget's disease may pose diagnostic difficulties.
METHODS: Histologic features and immunohistochemical profiles of 24 cases of
Bowen's disease, 21 cases of BAK, 18 cases of intraepidermal MEP, and 11 cases of
Paget's disease were analyzed.
RESULTS: Using multivariate logistic regression test, multinuclear giant cells
and solar degeneration were found to be the only histologic parameters of
diagnostic help. On the other hand, a widespread positive reaction for CK 5/8, CK
7, CK 19, and negative reaction for CK 10, was a helpful feature in the
differentiation of Paget's disease from Bowen's disease and BAK. The widespread
and strong expression of CK 10 was seen in almost all cases of Bowen's disease in
contrast to BAK. The widespread expression of CK 5/8 and CK 7, and negative
reaction for CK 10, was in favor of Paget's disease, compared to intraepidermal
MEP. On the other hand, widespread expression of CK 19 was a common finding in
intraepidermal MEP, in contrast to Bowen's disease.
CONCLUSION: An immunohistochemical panel may provide significant hints on the
differentiation of common intraepidermal malignancies, especially in problematic 
cases.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey.
drozkanferda@yahoo.com

A keratoacanthoma of the vulva in a 33-year-old woman is described. The patient
presented with a rapidly growing exophytic lesion of 1 cm in diameter over the
clitoris that had been present for a couple of months. An excisional biopsy was
performed. Pathologic examination of the exophytic nodule showed squamous
proliferation with a characteristic central keratin- filled crater. There were
pushing margins. High power microscopy showed squamous cells of cytologically
bland appearance with glassy cytoplasm. There were few mitotic figures. Less than
10% Ki-67-positive staining nuclei were seen. There was no p53 oncoprotein
overexpression. Keratoacanthoma of the vulva is rare with only five cases having 
been reviewed in the English literature since 1985. Keratoacanthomas are rapidly 
growing crateriform lesions on the sun-exposed skin of the elderly. Because of
its rarity in the vulva, the lesion can be misinterpreted as a malignant lesion
such as squamous cell carcinoma. Awareness of vulvar occurrence of
keratoacanthoma and its characteristic histopathologic features will help avoid
misdiagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma leading to radical surgery.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep,
Turkey. serk52@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of toluidine blue-stained wet films in the 
preliminary cytologic evaluation of serous effusions by means of specificity,
sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive value.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred seventy-six samples consisting of 122 pleural and
pericardial effusions and 54 peritoneal effusions from 160 patients were included
in the study. A toluidine blue-stained wet film of each sample was evaluated, and
diagnoses were compared with the diagnoses by conventional smears and cell blocks
on the same sample.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of wet films was 69%, 68% in pleural and pericardial
effusions and peritoneal effusions, respectively, and the specificity of wet
films was 93%, 92% in pleural and pericardial effusions and peritoneal effusions,
respectively. Positive predictive values of smears alone were 78% and 75%;
negative predictive values of smears alone were 96% and 95% in pleural and
pericardial effusions and peritoneal effusions, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Preliminary cytologic evaluation of serous effusions with toluidine
blue-stained wet films is simple and economical. It provides the opportunity to
plan additional procedures for the samples.

Porokeratosis of Mibelli induced by topical corticosteroid.

Yazkan F(1), Turk BG, Dereli T, Kazandi AC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, Ege University Medical Faculty, Bornova-Izmir,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: [corrected] Prorokeratosis of Mibelli is a chronic disorder
characterised by slightly atrophic plaques surrounded by keratotic border.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A 45-year-old with clobetazole propionate ointment for
psoriasis over 15 years developed characteristic lesions of porokeratosis Mibelli
on the elbows. Histopathological examination revealed the cornoid lamellae
located on the edges of the specimen and psoriasiform acanthosis and a spongiotic
pustule formation in the center of the specimen; thus, it was suggested as
'psoriasis encircled by porokeratosis'.
CONCLUSIONS: Development of porokeratosis may be explained by the local
immunosuppressive effect of the prolonged application of the topical steroid.

Kit expression in spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma can possibly create a different
approach for its tumorigenesis and therapy.

The use of a relatively nontoxic tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, imatinib
mesylate (IM) (STI-571), has increasingly become a valuable therapeutic
alternative in some KIT (CD117)-overexpressing neoplasms potentially because of
the presence of KIT-activating mutations. As the treatment eligibility for this
drug hinges on CD117 expression, KIT immunostaining has recently been widely
examined in various different tumors. We examined CD117 expression in pediatric
embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) to identify its eventual prognostic impact and
to evaluate its effect on tumorigenesis. This study included two spindle cell
(leiomyomatous) variants, two botryoid variants, and 21 conventional embryonal
RMSs. Sections from paraffin-embedded tumor samples were immunostained by a
standard SABC technique using c-kit polyclonal antibody with antigen retrieval.
In all the series, the percentage of CD117 positivity was 12%. Staining was
strong in two of two spindle cell variants, in zero of two botryoid variants, and
in one of 21 conventional embryonal RMSs. In Spearman's correlation analysis,
there was statistical relationship between the presence of CD117 expression and
the histological subtype of RMS. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no prognostic
significance of CD117 expression for survival. The present study demonstrated a
very limited expression of CD117 in pediatric embryonal RMS other than in the
spindle cell variant. This finding suggested that the stem cell factor/c-kit
pathway may be implicated in the tumorigenesis of spindle cell RMSs. Therefore,
the mutation of c-kit gene must be prospectively examined in larger series of
RMSs. If it can be verified that tissue expression of CD117 reflects the mutation
of c-kit gene, IM can be considered a targeted therapy for CD117-expressing RMSs,
particularly the spindle cell variant.

Immunolocalizations of VEGF, its receptors flt-1, KDR and TGF-beta's in
epithelial ovarian tumors.

Embryology, Uncubozkoy, Manisa, Turkey. sevincinan@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: Angiogenesis is an essential factor for growth, differentiation,
invasion and metastasis of tumors. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
immunolocalizations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptors
flt-1, KDR/flk-1, and transforming growth factor-beta's (TGF-beta) in epithelial 
ovarian tumors, utilizing indirect immunohistochemistry to understand the role of
the angiogenic events in ovarian neoplasia.
METHODS: Tissue blocks from 40 patients who had ovarian pathology (borderline
serous-mucinous tumor and malignant serous-mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary) 
were included in this study. All formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or primary antibodies against VEGF, 
flt-1, KDR/flk-1, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 using the
avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. H-SCORE, a semi-quantitative grading system, was
used to compare immunohistochemical staining intensities.
RESULTS: Positive VEGF immunoreactivity was concentrated in the epithelial and
stromal parts of all the ovarian samples and the endothelial cells in the stroma 
were also stained. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF was observed in malignant
ovarian adenocarcinomas compared to the borderline tumors of the ovary. VEGF
receptors, flt-1 and KDR/flk-1 immunoreactivities were detected not only in
vascular endothelial cells, but also in tumor cells at malignant sites.
Immunoreactivities of VEGF and its receptors were coexpressed in tumor cells of
the ovarian carcinoma. While immunoreactivities of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 were
both overexpressed in malignant ovarian carcinomas, immunoreactivity of TGF-beta3
was still mild.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that overexpression of VEGF, its receptors flt-1,
KDR/flk-1 and TGF-beta interaction may play an important role in the ovarian
cancer biology, with potential effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis. New
therapeutic strategies using VEGF and TGF-beta antagonists could obtain an
additional approach to the treatment ovarian carcinoma by inhibiting
angiogenesis.

CD24 expression in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma of
breast: an immunohistochemistry-based pilot study.

CD24 is a small, heavily glycosylated cell surface protein, that is expressed in 
a large variety of solid tumors. It is considered to play an important role in
tumor progression and metastasis. We aimed to evaluate CD24 expression in
invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCa), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and
non-tumorous breast tissues, and to investigate the relationship between
histopathological parameters, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and c-erbB2
expressions. The study included 34 IDCa, 25 DCIS, and 13 non-tumorous breast
tissues. All cases were reevaluated histopathologically, and immunohistochemistry
was performed with monoclonal CD24 antibody. The results clearly demonstrated
that CD24 expression, including membranous and cytoplasmic staining, was
significantly higher in DCIS and IDCa than in the non-tumorous breast (p=0.001,
p=0.000, and p=0.035, p=0.000, respectively). Cytoplasmic staining was detected
predominantly in neoplastic tissues and was significantly increased in high grade
DCIS (p=0.013). In invasive carcinomas, although the level of membranous staining
was significantly positively correlated with tumor grade (p=0.040), there was no 
such an association with the cytoplasmic level. However, it showed a trend
towards pT (p=0.089). In conclusion, our results suggest that higher CD24
expression may be associated with malignant transformation and progression in
breast cancer biology. Furthermore, higher membranous expression and, in
particular, cytoplasmic staining seem to predict malignant transformation, and

There is a peptide sequence homology between the gene product of human MUC4 and
rat Muc4/sialomucin complex (SMC). Each contains a transmembrane subunit with two
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains that act as ligand for ErbB2. MUC4 and
ErbB2 mediate intracellular signaling pathways that are linked to repression of
apoptosis and either to proliferation or to differentiation of tumor cells. This 
study investigates the expression of human MUC4 in neoplastic and corresponding
non-neoplastic tissues, and the relation of MUC4 expression in neoplastic tissues
to ErbB2 expression, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and tumor stage
in a series of 100 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). MUC4 and ErbB2
expressions and cell proliferation (PCNA) were shown using immunohistochemistry. 
Apoptotic index (AI) and tumor differentiation were determined by morphologic
criteria. All the non-neoplastic bronchial tissues and 85% of NSCLCs showed MUC4 
expression. MUC4 expression was found to be higher in neoplastic than in
non-neoplastic tissues (Yates correction p: 0.0006). MUC4 expression was
inversely correlated with AI (p=0.0002) and was correlated with ErbB2 expression 
(p=0.022), but not with PCNA counts and tumor stage. Our results indirectly
suggest that MUC4, in association with ErbB-2, might be involved in the
repression of apoptosis and differentiation rather than proliferation in tumor
cells of NSCLCs.

Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, which is overexpressed in many
carcinomas, including lung carcinoma. The aim of this immunohistochemical study
was to investigate the role of survivin in the early steps of lung carcinogenesis
and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), and its relationship with expression 
of p53 protein, a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle control. In the
normal bronchial epithelium, low-grade atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and
non-neoplastic lung parenchyma adjacent to tumor, survivin was found completely
negative. Expression of survivin was detected in the areas of squamous metaplasia
and dysplasia as well as high-grade AAH lesions adjacent to tumor. Survivin was
expressed in 50 (64%) and p53 in 41 (53%) NSCLC. Survivin expression was
significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (p=0.02). There was no
correlation between survivin and p53 expression. The patients with expression of 
survivin had significantly worse prognosis (Log-rank test, p=0.003). Multivariate
Cox regression analysis showed TNM stage (p<0.001) and survivin expression
(p=0.003) as independent prognostic indicators. In conclusion, survivin
expression might be an early step in lung carcinogenesis. Survivin expression
might also be used as a prognostic indicator predicting the worse outcome in
NSCLC, and might be a novel target for the treatment of patients with preinvasive
lesions of lung and NSCLC.

The clinical outcome of nonobstructive neonatal cholestasis (NC) cases varies
greatly and the prognosis is generally unpredictable. In this study, we aimed to 
evaluate the prognostic benefits of qualitative analysis of histopathological
changes in nonobstructive NC cases. A total of 28 nonobstructive NC cases (18
neonatal hepatitis; 10 intrahepatic bile duct paucity) were studied. We analyzed 
the relationship between histopathological and clinical parameters. Hepatic
inflammation, bridging necrosis, pericellular fibrosis, giant cell
transformation, and extramedullary hematopoiesis were evaluated and scored
according to their absence or presence in each case. The sum of the
histopathological scores was accepted as "total pathological injury score." The
height percentiles, the presence and the degree of hepatomegaly and ascites, and 
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, and bilirubin levels and
prothrombin time were also evaluated and scored. The patients were divided into 2
clinical course groups considered "good" or "bad" according to the total clinical
scores. For statistical analysis, Pearson's chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test,
and receiver operating characteristic curve were used. We found a statistically
significant negative relation between the clinical course and total pathological 
injury score (P = 0.042) and pericellular fibrosis (P = 0.016). In conclusion,
during the interpretation of liver biopsies of nonobstructive NC, scoring of
histopathological changes should be done for assessing the clinical prognostic
outcome.

Seckel syndrome was described as the prototype of the primordial bird-head type
of dwarfism. We report 2 cases of Seckel syndrome in siblings. Both cases showed 
peculiar phenotypic features. Autopsy was performed and microscopic examination
of the livers displayed histologic features of neonatal hepatitis. In addition,
our younger patient had central nervous system anomalies such as agenesis of
corpus callosum, cerebral cyst, and primitive convolutional pattern. No previous 
reports of liver disease exist in patients with Seckel syndrome. The pathologic
findings of such an unusual association and a review of literature are presented.

The "nested" variant is a rare form of urothelial carcinoma and its biologic
behavior is highly aggressive. Herein two new cases of nested variant of
urothelial carcinoma with immunohistochemical examination are presented. In one
of the cases, the tumor extended through the bladder wall into the perivesicular 
soft tissue, prostatic urethra and left vesicula seminalis, and metastasized to
obturator lymph nodes. In the other case, invasion of muscular layer was observed
and three recurrences were developed during a follow-up period of 23 months. Both
tumors of our study demonstrated high p53 and Ki-67 indices, supporting the
aggressive nature of such tumors.

Histological changes of liver glycogen storage in mice (Mus musculus) caused by
high-protein diets.

Ulusoy E(1), Eren B.

Mayis, Samsun, Turkey. esmaefe@yahoo.com

High Protein diets (HP) have been popular for people who want to lose weight
since the 1960s. Even though these diets do not harm healthy people in the short 
term, there is insufficient data to support their safe use and efficiency over a 
long period. Because of the fact that the proteins in these diets are mainly from
animal sources, it induces a higher intake of total fat, saturated fat and
cholesterol. It is proven that high protein diets cause both physical and
pathological abnormalities in the body. However, there exist very few studies
about the effects of high protein nutrition on liver glycogen storage. For this
study 40 Swiss albino mice consisting of two groups were used. The first group
was fed with 25% High Protein; the other was fed with standard meal. The two
groups were fed with respect to their diets for 30 days. At the end of 15th,
20th, 25th and 30th days 5 from each group were killed with cervical dislocation.
The livers were removed after perfusion then fixated. The routine paraffin
pursuit was applied before cutting into 5 micrometer sections and staining with
H-E, PAS and silver. There were major differences in weight loss between the
first and the fifteenth days. Glycogen storage was significantly reduced in HP
(15) stained with PAS. Hydropic degeneration and regenerative activity was
observed in H-E and silver stained HP group. As a result for the high protein
diet group, weight loss at the 15th day and a significant decrement in glycogen
storage at the 30th day was observed.

Turkey.

A total of 40 rat pups were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 (sham) rats
served as nonhypoxic controls. Group 2 (rhIL-4 treated/control) rats were
administrated rIL-4 alone. Group 3 (hypoxia-reoxygenation [H-O]/untreated) rats
were subjected to H-O and were then returned to their mothers. Group 4
(H-O/rhIL-4 treated) rats were subjected to H/O and were treated with rhIL-4 for 
the next 3 days. All animals were killed on day 4 and gastric and intestinal
specimens were obtained to determine the tissue level of malondialdehyde (MDA)
and histological changes. In group 3 MDA levels were significantly increased
compared with groups 1,2, and 4. In group 4, MDA levels were not significantly
different compared with group 3. The gastric and intestinal injury score were
increased significantly in group 3 and 4 rats compared with group 1 and 2.
However, this increase was lower in group 4 rats compared with group 3. In group 
3, after hypoxia following reoxygenation, exfoliation and necrosis of superficial
cells, blood cell infiltration, and structural alterations on the two-third parts
of the glandular pits, and bleeding erosions developed in all stomachs. Treatment
with rhIL-4 produced a reduction of exfoliation of superficial cells, hemorrhage,
and blood cell infiltration. In group 3 animals, destruction of villi and crypts 
of ileum and in some cases extension to the muscularis were noticed. In contrast,
in the rats treated with rhIL-4, lesions were limited essentially to the very
tips of the villi. This study found beneficial effects of rhIL-4 in an
experimental model of hypoxia-induced gastric and intestinal injury.

Bilateral testicular tumors are a rare complication of congenital adrenal
hyperplasia. It can be extremely difficult to distinguish histologically between 
Leydig cell tumors and adrenocortical rest hyperplasia, which may lead in some
cases to unnecessary orchidectomy. A 7-yr-old boy was admitted because of
precocious puberty and enlargement of testicles. Hormonal studies established the
diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Testicular biopsy revealed interlacing strands, cords, and rests of cells
resembling interstitial (Leydig) cells but with no Reinke crystalloids. Here we
report a case of testicular adrenal rest hyperplasia in congenital adrenal
hyperplasia and discuss the pathological and clinical features and origin of this
rare lesion by using immunohistochemical evaluation.

Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasonographic features of 
infracentimetric nodules in patients with nodular goiter: correlation with
pathological findings.

We evaluated the usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine-needle-aspiration biopsy
(US-FNAB) for infracentimetric nodules. In addition, we used sonography to assess
the risk of malignancy of thyroid nodules, and we evaluated the extent of disease
in infracentimetric cancers. The cytopathological results of 472 US-FNABs from
207 nodular goiter patients (170 women, 37 men; mean age, 51.5 +/- 13.1 yr) seen 
between 1999 and 2004 were categorized into five groups: inadequate, benign,
suspicious, follicular neoplasm, and malignant. There were 145 infracentimetric
nodules and 327 supracentimetric nodules. All patients underwent surgery. Final
histopathological results correlated with cytologic results. The sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy
of US-FNAB for infracentrimetric nodules were 96.3%, 71.2%, 44.8%, 98.8%, and
76.1%; and for supracentimetric nodules, these values were 98.1%, 63.1%, 35.6%,
99.4, and 69.1%, respectively. There were no significant differences between
infracentimetric and supracentimetric nodules. More thyroid cancer could be
detected in infracentimetric nodules that were hypoechoic or had fine
calcification on ultrasonography (which may be helpful in discriminating which
nodules are appropriate for FNAB) than in supracentimetric nodules. However,
logistic regression analyses showed that no single variable was predictive of
malignancy in infracentimetric nodules. The malignancy rate in infracentimetric
nodules was 21.4%. In this subgroup, 4 of 31 patients (12.9%) had multifocal
tumors at surgery, 3 of 31 had extrathyroidal invasion, and 1 had a metastasis to
the lung. In addition, at surgery, 11 of 55 tumors (20%) larger than 1 cm were
multifocal. In conclusion, small tumor size does not guarantee a low risk of
thyroid cancer, and US-FNAB may be useful tool for diagnosing malignant
infracentimetric nodules.

Extramedullary hematopoiesis mimicking acute appendicitis: a rare complication of
idiopathic myelofibrosis.

Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is rarely found in the gastrointestinal tract.
To our knowledge, EMH involving the appendix was not described. We report a case 
with a previous history of idiopathic myelofibrosis, which presented with
clinical findings of acute appendicitis that necessitate appendectomy after the
relief of his anemia. Microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry revealed
foci of EMH throughout the mucosa and the submucosa. In the latter, small
clusters of hematopoietic cells were also detected in a few dilated vascular
structures. The histopathological features of acute appendicitis were not
observed. Our case supports that EMH might develop in organs that are not
involved in hematopoiesis. Although in gastrointestinal system, obstruction and
bleeding are the most common symptomatic manifestations, this case emphasizes
that EMH might also present clinically as acute appendicitis. The absence of
histopathological features of acute appendicitis raises the possibility that
local production of some mediators from hematopoietic precursor cells might
contribute to this clinical presentation.

Asphyxial deaths: a retrospective study and review of the literature.

Azmak D(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Forensic Medicine, Trakya University, Medical Faculty, Edirne,
Turkey.

An increasing death rate as a result of violence constitutes a large group in
medicolegal autopsies. Specially, deaths due to asphyxia are one of the most
important causes in violence deaths. During the 21-year period from January 1984 
to October 2004, there were 134 asphyxial deaths autopsied by the Department of
Forensic Medicine, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey. Asphyxial deaths comprise
15.7% of all forensic autopsies; 20.8% of the cases are aged between 30 and 39
years, and the average age was 41.9 years. Males constitute 79.8% of all the
cases. The most frequent method of asphyxiation death is hanging (56 cases,
41.8%), followed by drowning (30.5%) and carbon monoxide poisoning (8.2%). More
violent methods, such as ligature or manual strangulations, constitute 2.9% and
2.3% of all asphyxial deaths, respectively. Although it was varying according to 
the methods of asphyxiation, suicide was found to be the manner of death in the
majority of the cases.

Incidental calcifying fibrous tumor of the stomach presenting as a polyp.

Elpek GO(1), Küpesiz GY, Ogüs M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Akdeniz University Medical School, Akdeniz, Antalya, 
Turkey. elpek@akdeniz.edu.tr

Calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is an uncommon lesion of uncertain cause and
pathogenesis that has a unique histological appearance. These lesions are
described mainly in the subcutaneous or deep soft tissues, followed by subserosal
locations. Intrinsic visceral CFT is extremely rare. Herein is described a rare
case of CFT that involved the gastric wall, along with a review of the
literature. An incidental small polypoid lesion was excised during urgent surgery
for penetrating injury at the lesser curvature in a 25-year-old man, previously
healthy. The lesion was a well-demarcated, small (10 mm) tumor that occupied the 
submucosa. The characteristic histopathological features and the presence of
spindle cells that express factor XIIIa allowed a diagnosis of CFT to be made.
The present case and the review revealed that, despite their frequent
subperitoneal location, intra-abdominal CFT might present as intrinsic visceral
lesions and might be found incidentally. These lesions tend to be smaller when
compared to their symptomatic counterparts. The diffuse factor XIIIa expression
in CFT might be useful to differentiate this entity from other intra-abdominal
soft-tissue tumors in problematic cases. Although rarity of intrinsic visceral
CFT necessitates new cases to determine their exact biological behavior, the
present case highlights their presence in the stomach as a symptomless small
polypoid lesion.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: We aim to examine p63 expression in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and 
to investigate association with their histopathological differentiation subtypes.
METHODS: Eighty-four BCCs were classified according to the histopathologic
differentiation subtypes. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody against 
p63 was performed.
RESULTS: In nontumoral skin, p63 expression was consistently seen in
basal/suprabasal cells of epidermis, hair matrix cells, and outer root sheath of 
the hair follicle. In BCCs, the cases were distributed as 47 undifferentiated, 28
differentiated (16 adenoid and 12 keratotic), and nine superficial. The nuclear
p63 expression was negative in two cases, whereas 64 BCCs (76.2%) showed
homogeneous p63 immunostaining. There was no statistically significant difference
between p63 expression and histological differentiation subtypes (p > 0.05). The 
expression of p63 was found strongly and diffuse in 72.3% of solid
undifferentiated and 82.1% differentiated and in 77.8% of superficial type BCCs.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 is consistently expressed in epidermal basal/suprabasal and
adnexal basal cells. Most BCCs have higher homogeneous p63 expression than
nontumoral epidermis, which is not changed according to histological
differentiation subtypes. Thus, overexpression of p63 in all histological
subtypes may confirm that basaloid progenitor cells are linked tumor-cell lineage
and have a role in the tumorigenesis of BCC.

Multicentric malignant Schwannoma in a crossbred cow.

Beytut E(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Kafkas,
Kars, Turkey.

Multicentric malignant Schwannoma in a crossbred cow is described. Multiple and
solitary nodules of varying sizes were seen to be distributed throughout the body
of the animal, mainly along the peripheral nerves supplying the muscles of the
thoracic and abdominal regions and the skin. Multiple nodules were also observed 
in the hilus of the liver. The mediastinal lymph nodes were replaced by a large
solitary tumorous mass. Multiple neoplastic linear cords with small nodules were 
observed on the pericardium. Histologically, the nodules showed mainly densely
packed, spindle-shaped cells arranged in short interwoven bundles and whorls
(Antoni type A pattern). Stellate, spindle-shaped and round or oval tumour cells 
proliferated haphazardly within the loose texture of a collagenous matrix (Antoni
type B pattern). Immunohistochemically, in both Antoni type A and type B areas,
neoplastic cells reacted with antibodies against S-100 protein. Based on the
metastasis of the tumour to the lymph nodes and on histology, the neoplasm was
diagnosed as a multicentric malignant Schwannoma.

(1)Division of Clinical Cytology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine,
University of Ankara, Turkey. korayceyhan@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Pituitary carcinomas are extremely rare tumors of the
adenohypophysis. The presence of craniospinal and/or systemic extracranial
metastases is the only reliable criterion for the diagnosis of pituitary
carcinoma. To date, only 2 cases have been reported correctly by fine needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB). We present an additional case of pituitary carcinoma
with FNAB features.
CASE: A 60-year-old woman presented with clinical features of Cushing's disease
and a pituitary tumor. She underwent transsphenoidal resection of the tumor. The 
initial diagnosis was an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-producing invasive
pituitary adenoma. The patient presented again with neck pain 6 years after the
operation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed metastatic tumor masses at the
level of C5-C6 of the cervical vertebrae. Intraoperative fine needle aspiration
and incomplete excision of metastatic tumors were performed. Cytologically, tumor
cells were composed of a combination of loose groups and single cells. Neoplastic
cells had a relatively monotonous appearance and displayed characteristic
neuroendocrine tumor features. Immunocytochemistry from cell block sections
revealed AE1/ AE3, synaptophysin chromogranin A and ACTH positivity in the tumor 
cells.
CONCLUSION: Pituitary carcinoma with extracranial systemic metastases
demonstrates typical neuroendocrine features on fine needle aspiration. In the
differential diagnosis, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinomas should be kept in
mind. In the absence of sufficient clinical data, these 2 entities cannot be
distinguished correctly through the cytologic features.

Tall cell variant of papillary carcinoma arising from a thyroglossal cyst: report
of a case with diagnosis by fine needle aspiration cytology.

Köybaşioğlu F(1), Simşek GG, Onal BU.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology and Cytology Unit, Social Security Foundation Training
Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Papillary carcinoma arising from a thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) is
the most frequent malignancy arising from this embryologic remnant of the
thyroglossal duct. The preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of
such neoplasms has rarely been cited. Approximately 170 TDC cases have been
reported in the literature worldwide, diagnosed solely on histopathology.
CASE: A 63-year-old woman presented with an anterior midline neck mass of years' 
duration. A hypodense cyst was located at the level of the hyoid bone. FNAC of
the midline neck mass showed bloody, mucoid material and numerous atypical,
elongated cells. The aspirated material was reported as "papillary carcinoma
possibly arising from the thyroglossal duct," and the diagnosis was confirmed by 
histopathologic investigation on resection material.
CONCLUSION: Tall cell variant is a rare variant of papillary carcinoma and has a 
poor prognosis. The differential diagnosis includes Hürthle cell lesions,
oncocytic papillary thyroid carcinoma and Warthin-like papillary carcinoma.

AIM: To establish whether there is a correlation between angiogenesis and
metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma (PCMM).
METHODS: We studied the microvessel density and the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) in
22 cases of PCMM with metastasis at presentation (metastatic group) and 28 cases 
of PCMM without metastasis for 24 months or more (non-metastatic group).
Microvessels were stained with CD31/PECAM-1 antibody and counted. We assessed the
proportion of VEGF expression in tumour cells, lymphocytes infiltrating the
tumour (TIL) and lymphocytes at the periphery of the tumour, as well as the
proportion of bFGF expression in tumour cell cytoplasms, nuclei and intra- and
peritumoral vessels.
RESULTS: An increased microvessel density was detected in the metastatic group
(15-33 [24.09 +/- 5.55] versus 2-24 [12.96 +/- 6.02]). Moreover, enhanced
expression of VEGF in tumour cells and peritumoral lymphocytes (Chi-square p =
0.038 and p = 0.018) and bFGF in peritumoral vessels (chi(2) p = 0.013)
correlated with the simultaneous presence of melanoma metastasis in PCMM.
Furthermore, microvessel density was correlated with the expression of bFGF in
peritumoral vessels (rs = 0.53, p = 0.049) and VEGF in tumour cells (rs = 0.37, p
= 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Microvessel density as well as the expression of both VEGF and bFGF
might be informative concerning the progression of melanoma.

Medicine, Turkey. drffidan@yahoo.com

AIMS: To compare the effects of cigarette smoke and dried dung smoke exposure on 
the histopathology of lungs.
METHODS: Three groups each with five rabbits were formed. The cigarette smoke
group was exposed to cigarette smoke, the biomass group was exposed to dried dung
smoke and the control group was exposed to dry air 1 hour daily for 1 month. At
the end of 1 month, animals were sacrificed and lung tissues were examined
histopathologically.
RESULTS: Histopathological evaluation of rabbits' lungs revealed that
intraparenchymal vascular congestion and thrombosis, intraparenchymal
haemorrhage, respiratory epithelial proliferation, number of macrophages in the
alveolar and bronchial lumen, alveolar destruction, emphysematous changes and
bronchoalveolar haemorrhage scores were significantly increased in rabbits
exposed to cigarette smoke compared with the control group. Respiratory
epithelial proliferation, alveoli destruction and emphysematous change scores
were significantly increased in rabbits exposed to dried dung smoke compared with
the control group.
CONCLUSION: Although less than the effects of cigarette smoke, dried dung smoke
had severe histopathological effects on rabbits' lungs.

Angioleiomyoma is an uncommon type of leiomyoma of the uterus that originates
from smooth muscle cells and contains thick-walled vessels. A 45-year-old woman
with the complaint of lower abdominal pain was admitted to the hospital. In the
operation a ruptured, bleeding uterine tumor was seen. She underwent total
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. On pathologic examination of
the specimen, the tumor was diagnosed as angioleiomyoma. Here, an unusual
clinical presentation of uterine angioleiomyoma was reported.

It has previously been reported that intratumoral microvessel density (IMD), and 
the expression of bFGF and nm23-H1 are useful prognostic markers in colorectal
cancer (CRC). In this study, a total of 100 CRCs were evaluated
histopathologically, and IMD, bFGF and nm23-H1 expression were assessed by
immunohistochemistry. IMD of patients increased with grade and stage, and this
increase was statistically significant (p<0.05). A significantly higher incidence
of high bFGF expression scores was also associated with increasing grade and
stage (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the grades
in nm23-H1 expression (p=0.234). nm23-H1 expression occurred with lower incidence
in stages C1, C2 and D than in stages B1 and B2 (p<0.05). Thus, a negative
correlation was found between nm23-H1 expression and stage or lymph node
metastasis (LNM) (p<0.05). IMD and bFGF expression were positively correlated
with grade, stage, LNM, and lymphovascular invasion. Although positive
correlation was found between IMD and bFGF, nm23-H1 expression negatively
correlated with both of them. As a result, in clinical practice, increased IMD
and bFGF expression and decreased nm23-H1 expression may provide valuable
information in characterizing the malignant phenotype.

bladder carcinoma.

In various human cancers, dysfunction of the E-cadherin-catenin complex is
associated with a decrease in cellular and tissue differentiation, and with
higher invasive and metastatic potentials. The objective of this study was to
investigate E-cadherin and alpha-catenin expression in superficial noninvasive
papillary TCC and invasive TCC, and correlate these results with pathological and
clinical parameters. We have used immunohistochemistry to localize Ecadherin and 
alpha-catenin in 56 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 41
patients with superficial bladder cancer and 15 with invasive bladder cancer. The
46 male and 10 female patients had a mean age of 67 years, with range of 40 to 82
years. The mean follow-up time was 33.4 (range 5-120) months. Tumor grade 1:2:3
ratios were 5:32:19. In superficial bladder tumor, abnormal expression of
E-cadherin and alpha-catenin was demonstrated in 37 and 71% of the tumors,
respectively. In advanced bladder tumor, abnormal expression of E-cadherin and
alpha-catenin was demonstrated in 80 and 100% of the tumors, respectively.
Differences in expression of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin could be discerned
between superficial and advanced bladder tumors (p=0.004, p=0.024, respectively).
However, the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin expression and
tumor grade was not statistically significant (p>0.05). In addition, the
expression of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin did not correlate with tumor number
and size (p>0.05). We have demonstrated that abnormal expression of E-cadherin
and/or alpha-catenin occurs in more than 85% of bladder carcinomas and correlates
significantly only with advanced stage. Nevertheless, these observations need to 
be confirmed in larger prospective clinical studies.

histomorphometrical alterations in cyclosporin A-induced gingival overgrowth in
rats.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Proliferating
Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) expression and histomorphometrical alterations in
cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth with or without microbial dental 
plaque accumulation. Forty male Wistar rats were equally divided into 4 groups;
Group I (control); Group II (CsA); Group III (ligature); Group IV (ligature and
CsA). After 8 weeks of experimental period, rats were subsequently decapitated
and mandibular molars were dissected. Gingival overgrowth was determined by
measuring depth of the gingival sulcus, then the mandible were decalcified and
serial sections were obtained for histomorphometric and immunohistochemical
analysis. Histomorphometric analysis included the measurement of epithelial
thickness; immunohistochemical analysis included the assessment of PCNA
expression in the oral and sulcular epithelium of buccal and lingual gingiva.
Epithelial thickness and PCNA expression were significantly increased in buccal
oral epithelium of Group II (p < 0.05) and in all regions in Group IV (p < 0.05) 
compared to control group. Also gingival overgrowth was more prominent in Group
IV in comparison to Group II. These results indicate that CsA-induced gingival
alterations are closely associated with increased epithelial proliferative
activity, and dental plaque accumulation seems not to be an essential but to be
an aggrevating factor for the progression of the lesion.

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that chronic infections may
have a role in both the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. While the 
majority of available data are focused on coronary artery disease, our aim was to
investigate the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori in
samples from aortoiliac occlusive disease.
METHODS: Aorta-iliac atherectomy specimens were collected under sterile
conditions from 21 patients (19 male, 2 female) undergoing surgery for aortoiliac
occlusive disease. Seventeen macroscopically healthy vessels (12 internal mammary
arteries, 3 radial arteries, prepared for coronary artery bypass graft, and 2
traumatic artery specimens, one of which was a superficial femoral artery and the
other was a radial artery) were used as control. Blood samples for serological
assays were obtained immediately before surgery. The polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was employed to search for H. pylori and C. pneumoniae DNA in
atherosclerotic plaques and healthy vessel samples. Group-specific chlamydial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens in atherosclerotic plaques and in healthy
vessel samples and serum IgG antibodies to chlamydial LPS were determined by
using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Antibodies to H. pylori were also tested in all cases by means of an in-house
ELISA.
RESULTS: Chlamydial LPS and DNA were detected in 6 of 21 (28.57%) atherosclerotic
lesions using ELISA or PCR, respectively. There was no evidence of H. pylori DNA 
in any plaque specimens. All cases in which C. pneumoniae DNA was positive were
also seropositive for antichlamydial LPS. Neither C. pneumoniae DNA nor antigen
nor H. pylori DNA was found in the macroscopically healthy samples.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that C. pneumoniae but not, as proposed, H.
pylori may be involved in the pathogenesis of aortoiliac atherosclerosis.

Rhabdoid tumor (RT) is an uncommon childhood neoplasm that typically arises
within the kidney. It is characterized by an aggressive clinical course. Since
its description in 1978, several cases of primary extrarenal RT, including a CNS 
localization, have been reported. The first case in the CNS was reported in 1985 
and was defined as "rhabdoid tumor" initially, and was classified as grade IV in 
the most recent classification of the World Health Organization under the term of
"atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor". Nearly 200 cases of atypical
teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the CNS have been reported to date, most of them
occurring in childhood. We report a case of primary RT of the brain located in
the right frontal lobe with the clinical, radiographic and pathological features 
presenting at an unusual age. This tumor, which was composed purely of rhabdoid
cells with no additional primitive neuroectodermal, epithelial and mesenchymal
components, was in a 27-year-old male patient. In conclusion, RT should be
considered also in the differential diagnosis of intracerebral neoplasms of adult
patients.

In this study the prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), antifungal
susceptibility and proteinase production of isolated Candida species were
investigated. Vaginal swabs were collected from symptomatic women with
vulvovaginitis attending the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of Kocaeli
University, Turkey. The relation between risk factors, such as pregnancy,
diabetes mellitus, antibiotic and corticosteroid use, history of sexually
transmitted diseases and contraceptive methods, was recorded. Candida spp. were
identified by conventional methods, then evaluated for proteinase secretion in a 
medium containing casein. Antifungal susceptibility was determined according to
the NCCLS microdilution method. The prevalence of women with vulvovaginitis was
35.7% (170/6080) and 16% (28/170) of them were diagnosed as VVC. Candida albicans
was the dominant species: 21 (75%), followed by 4 C. glabrata (14%), 2 C.
tropicalis (7%), and one C. krusei (3.5%). All isolates were susceptible to
fluconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B, except one C. krusei, one C.
glabrata and one C. albicans that were resistant to fluconazole. Proteinase
production was determined in 19 (90.5%) C. albicans and in all C. tropicalis
isolates. Proteinase activity was not associated with antifungal resistance. No
association was found between risk factors and VVC.

Endothelium is the first physiological barrier between blood and tissues and can 
be injured by physical or chemical stress, particularly by the drugs used in the 
cancer therapy. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin are frequently used anticancer drugs
and their cardiac side effects are well observed in clinical setting. Their side 
effects on the endothelium are still not clear enough. There are few
investigations assessing the damages elicited by the combination use of
chemotherapy agents in animal experimental models. The purpose of this study was 
to examine and compare the side effects of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on
endothelium in vivo. The drugs were administered weekly to rats via
intraperitoneal injections singly or in combinations. Lastly, aorta endothelium
was examined. The most familiar parts of the aorta endothelium are the nucleus,
free ribosomes, Weibel-Palada granules, plasmalemmal vesicles, and clear basement
membrane. Examination of the endothelium and the related structures revealed some
clear degenerative findings. Notably, administration of a paclitaxel and
doxorubicin combinations caused the most dramatic change in ultrastructure, which
may disrupt many functions of the endothelium.

Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, are found in skin lesions and plasma of patients with psoriasis.
Clinical improvement of psoriasis with cyclosporin A treatment is accompanied by 
downmodulation of proinflammatory epidermal cytokines. In this study to determine
the effects of cyclosporin A on the ultrastructural changes and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in psoriasis,
biopsy specimens before and after cyclosporin A treatment were evaluated
ultrastructurally and immunohistochemically. Ten patients were given 3-7.5 mg/kg 
oral cyclosporin A for 6 months. Before and after treatment full thickness of
4-mm punch biopsies were obtained from patients and from 6 healthy volunteers.
Samples were processed for electron microscopic and immunohistochemical
evaluation. The treatment was well tolerated with complete clinical improvement. 
The ultrastructural changes such as reduction of tonofilaments, dilatation of
intercellular space, and interruption in lamina densa were recovered by
cyclosporin A treatment. The increased staining intensity of tumor necrosis
factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on epidermal keratinocytes and
endothelial cells was reduced after cyclosporin A therapy. Cyclosporin A
treatment results in total normalization of the electron microscopic picture of
psoriasis and its beneficial effect depends on the direct inhibition of tumor
necrosis factor-alpha and consequently intercellular adhesion molecule-1.

Insular carcinoma of the thyroid with uncommon cytologic features: anisokaryotic 
cells and microfollicles containing dense colloid.

Erkiliç S(1), Koçer NE.

(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep,

Insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a rare neoplasm, constituting less than 5% of
all thyroid tumors. It was Carcangiu et al. who first described this tumor, which
exhibits an intermediate biologic behavior between well-differentiated and
undifferentiated follicular carcinomas, as a distinct clinicopathologic entity. A
63-year-old female patient with thyroid enlargement was admitted to our
institution. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a 5x4x3cm solid nodule within the
right thyroid lobe. The fine needle aspiration was highly cellular; there were
individual cells with naked nuclei, loose aggregates, cohesive clusters of
follicular cells and infrequent microfollicles with round-oval nuclei containing 
finely granular chromatin, and scant cytoplasm. There were two uncommon findings 
not previously reported in the literature. The first one is anisokaryotic nuclei,
and the second one is the presence of dense colloid in the center of
microfollicles. The aspiration biopsy was reported as malignant. The patient
underwent bilateral total thyroidectomy. Histopathologically, the lesion was
diagnosed as insular carcinoma. We believe that in addition to the previously
described cytopathologic findings, microfollicles with dense colloid core and
anisokaryosis may be indicators of insular carcinoma in thyroid FNACs.

Author information: 
(1)Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey. arzu_turantr@yahoo.com

Sudden death is defined as a death that occurs suddenly, develops during an
unpredictable course, and is due to natural or unnatural causes. Although there
is no universally standardized definition on how "sudden" a sudden death is, WHO 
defines sudden death as a death that occurs within 24 hours after the onset of
symptoms. The aim of this study is to present 2 rarely reported autopsy cases and
to emphasize the importance of systemic autopsy at sudden death. On macroscopic
examination, crescent-shaped, thick, fibrous membranes, located 5 mm and 3 mm
away from the aortic valves, were detected. Fibrous membranes extended from the
ventricular septum to the left ventricular outflow tract, thus apparently
narrowing this region. Left ventricular wall and septum were slightly thickened, 
and there were scattered grayish-white areas of a small diameter. These became
more intense in the septum and myocardium of the left ventricle on the anterior
plane of the myocardial sections. In both cases, the aortic valves of were
thickened and also markedly narrowed on one of them. In this case, the fibrous
membrane adhered to the aortic valve and extended to the anterior leaflet of the 
mitral valve at one side. Both aortic valves comprised 3 leaflets. Other valves
and coronary arteries showed no macroscopic pathologic findings. Microscopic
examination of both cases demonstrated that the fibrous membrane comprising
abundant collagen fibers was situated on the ventricular septum. Hypertrophy,
moderate to severe interstitial fibrosis, and focal areas of scarring were
observed in the specimens taken from the septal and ventricular myocardium. No
abnormality was found on the conduction system examinations. Toxicologic analysis
results in blood were negative. Based on the findings, membranous-type (discrete 
type) subvalvular aortic stenosis, diagnosed during the autopsy, was considered
as the cause of sudden death in both cases.

Turkey is located on the main overland connection between Asia and Europe, making
the country potentially vulnerable to drug trafficking and its associated harms. 
The aim of the present study is to explore the frequency of all deaths from drug 
overdose and toxicity in Turkey and to describe some of the characteristics of
these deaths. We collected data on all deaths from drugs in Turkey between 1997
and 2001 using records from the Council of Forensic Medicine. Data obtained from 
autopsy reports were retrospectively analyzed. In the present study, 374 deaths
from drugs were reported in Turkey, with a mortality rate of 0.17 per 100,000
population. Highest mortality rates were found in Istanbul (0.83) and Gaziantep
(0.71). The mean age was 34.0, and most cases (71.7%) were below the age of 40.
The proportion of female cases was 13.6%. Opiates were implicated in 91.5% of
deaths and benzodiazepines in 25.9%. Two fifths (38.8%) of the cases involved use
of more than 1 drug. In 36.6% of cases, the route of final drug administration
was by injection. The most common location of death was at a home (33.7%).
Interventions to reduce drug use nationally are urgently required. International 
cooperation in social-educational activities, scientific research, and security
measures is essential for this war.

Perinatal expression of HSP70 and VEGF in neonatal rat lung vessels exposed to
nicotine during gestation.

Author information: 
(1)Erciyes University Medical Faculty, Kayseri, Turkey. ozlemorcan@yahoo.com

We assessed the influence of maternal nicotine exposure during gestation on
perinatal expression of HSP70 and VEGF in rat lung parenchyma and lung vessels.
Adult white Sprague-Dawley virgin rats were mated with adult male rats over 2
days, with two females for every male. After confirming pregnancy, 30 gravid rats
(dams) were then randomly assigned to two equal groups (one experimental and one 
control; n=15 in each). Experimental dams were treated with subcutaneus (s.c.)
(-)-nicotine tartrate, 3 mg/kg body weight/day, during pregnancy from gestational
days 9 through 21. After sacrifice, lungs were removed en bloc and
formalin-fixed, and paraffinembedded tissue sections were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry using a three-step streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method
with monoclonal antibodies directed against HSP70 or VEGF. HSP70 and VEGF
expression was increased in the vascular smooth muscle cells of the experimental 
group (t1) compared to the control group (t(2))t(1)=7.593, t(2)=4.666, p<0.05).
The number of bronchioles that stained positively with HSP70 was higher in the
nicotineexposed group than in the control group (t(1)=9.274, t(2)=6.956, p<0.05).
In conclusion, gestational nicotine exposure increased the expression of VEGF and
HSP70 in rat lung parenchyma, especially in the airway epithelium and vascular
smooth muscle cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, these molecules may
contribute to nicotine-related hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.

Adrenocortical tumors in the pediatric population are rare. Classification of
these tumors as adenomas or carcinomas using histological criteria is often
difficult. Immunohistochemical expressions of proliferative markers are currently
under investigation for utilization in the differential diagnosis and prediction 
of clinical outcomes. The value of histone proteins as prognostic markers in
adrenocortical tumors has not yet been elucidated. We evaluated the histological 
features, immunohistochemical staining of Ki 67, and in situ hybridization for
histone mRNA in 30 pediatric adrenocortical tumors. We investigated the
relationship between these parameters and the prognosis. Using the classification
proposed by Weiss, 19 tumors were classified as carcinomas and 11 as adenomas. Ki
67 and histone mRNA labeling indices (LIs, the percentage of Ki 67-positive and
histone mRNA-positive tumor cells, respectively) were significantly higher in
carcinomas than in adenomas (Ki 67 LI was 14.62+/-5.79 in adenomas and
20.35+/-6.23 in carcinomas, p=0.02. Histone mRNA LI was 1.73+/-1.71 in adenomas
and 6.62+/-2.28 in carcinomas, p=0.00). The proliferative activity assessed by
histone mRNA was lower than that assessed by Ki 67 in both diagnostic groups. The
cut off point for the diagnosis of malignancy was found to be 14.55 for Ki 67 LI 
and 5.75 for histone mRNA LI. A correlation was found between a histone mRNA
LI>or=5 and poor prognosis (recurrence, metastasis, or death). We concluded that 
the proliferative activity of the tumor assessed by Ki 67 and histone mRNA may
assist in differentiating adrenocortical adenomas and carcinomas. In addition,
our results suggest that the most reliable parameter to predict prognosis in
pediatric adrenocortical tumors is the histone mRNA LI.

METHODS: Twenty-two adult male Wistar albino rats weighing between 280 and 300 g 
were used. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, Li and
Li+CAPE groups. Li and CAPE were co-administered intraperitoneally twice daily
for 4 weeks. Control rats were given 0.9% NaCl during the same period. All the
rats were allowed to feed ad libitum until midnight after they had received the
proposed treatment.
RESULTS: In the Li group, peribronchial and intraparenchymal lymphocyte and
macrophage infiltration were observed. Atypical type II pneumocytes, alveolar
destruction and emphysematous changes were also detected. Lymphocyte and
macrophage infiltration was significantly decreased in the Li+CAPE group compared
with the Li group. Alveolar destruction, emphysematous changes and
intraparenchymal mononuclear cell infiltration were also recovered to a level
close to the control group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were increased in the Li
group compared with the control group. CAPE administration decreased the MDA
levels in the Li+CAPE group.
CONCLUSIONS: CAPE was found to associate with histopathological changes recovery 
in the lungs and oxidative stress due to Li treatment.

AIMS: The differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma (MM) from benign
mesothelial lesions (BML) based on histopathological criteria is sometimes not
satisfying and causes diagnostic problems for histopathologists. We aimed to
investigate whether the immunohistochemically determined cell proliferation rate 
and telomerase activity, using Ki-67 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) immunohistochemistry, respectively, are useful in the differential
diagnosis of MM from BML.
METHODS: Sixty-six cases of MM (33 epithelioid, 30 biphasic and 3 sarcomatoid)
and 22 cases of BML (15 reactive mesothelial proliferations and 7 fibrous
pleuritis/pericarditis) were included in this study. We evaluated the
proliferative activity by Ki-67 and telomerase activity by hTERT
immunohistochemistries for each case.
RESULTS: The mean value of the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) in MMs was
significantly higher than that of BMLs. Biphasic MMs have higher a Ki-67 PI than 
epithelioid and sarcomatoid types. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry has a sensitivity
of 74%, specificity of 86% and positive predictive value of 94% in detecting MM. 
hTERT immunohistochemistry detected MM with sensitivity and specificity of 68%.
CONCLUSION: As a result, being cheap and simple methods, Ki-67 and hTERT
immunohistochemistries can be used in differentiating malignant and benign
mesothelial lesions in routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material.

The distribution pattern of pathology and cholinergic deficits in amygdaloid
complex in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

We studied the distribution pattern of pathology and cholinergic deficits in the 
subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex (AC) in five patients with Alzheimer's
disease (AD), eight with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and five normal
controls. In controls, the basal nucleus contained the highest choline
acetyltransferase activity; the activity in the lateral and central nuclei and
those in the cortical, medial and accessory basal nuclei were comparable. In AD, 
there was a significant decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity in the
accessory basal and lateral nuclei, in DLB a significant decrease was observed in
the accessory basal, lateral and cortical nuclei. Compared to controls the
hyperphosphorylated tau-pathology burden was significantly higher in the basal,
central and medial nuclei in AD and in the central, cortical, lateral and medial 
nuclei in DLB. The amyloid plaque burden was significantly higher in the
accessory basal, basal, lateral and cortical nuclei in AD and in all nuclei in
DLB. The alpha-synuclein burden was significantly higher in all nuclei in both AD
and DLB. Compared to AD alpha-synuclein burden was higher in all nuclei in DLB.
There were no correlations between the distribution pattern of
hyperphosphorylated tau-pathology, amyloid plaques and alpha-synuclein-positive
structures, and choline acetyltransferase activity, except the lateral nucleus in
DLB. In conclusion we found no relationship between the pattern of cholinergic
deficits and the distribution pattern of lesions in the AC of patients with AD or
DLB. Cholinergic deficits were more prominent in the nuclei of basolateral (BL)
group in AD, whereas the nuclei of both BL and corticomedial groups were involved
in DLB, which may be due to the involvement of both basal forebrain and brainstem
cholinergic nuclei in the latter.

Renal medullary changes in renal allograft recipients with raised serum
creatinine.

Author information:

Turkey. banu.sis@deu.edu.tr

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the renal medulla may reflect rejection
related changes and thus have a predictive value in the assessment of acute renal
allograft rejection or chronic graft damage.
METHODS: 75 post-transplant biopsies from 57 patients were scored according to
the Banff 1997 scheme. The biopsies with adequate cortical and medullary tissue
(n = 23) were selected and medullary tissues were reviewed for rejection related 
lesions except intimal arteritis. Chronic damage was determined by image analysis
depending on periodic acid-methenamine silver (PAMS)-Masson trichrome (MT)
staining. Medullary and cortical changes were compared.
RESULTS: Interstitial inflammation and tubulitis were more frequent and severe in
the cortex (p<0.001). Medullary tubulitis was associated with intimal arteritis
(p = 0.003, r = 0.598). Medullary interstitial inflammation (n = 8) and tubulitis
(n = 4) were associated with cortical borderline changes (n = 5) or allograft
rejection (n = 3). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive values of medullary inflammatory changes in predicting cortical
allograft rejection were 43%, 69%, 37%, and 73%, respectively. A significant
association was observed between medullary MT-SAP and cortical PAMS-SAP values (p
= 0.02, R(2) = 0.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Acute rejection related lesions are more common and severe in the
cortex, and the renal medulla does not sufficiently reflect cortical rejection.
The positive and negative predictive values of medullary changes for allograft
rejection are low, and medullary inflammation is not a reliable indicator of
allograft rejection. Increased medullary fibrosis is correlated with chronic
cortical damage.

The effect of oestradiol and neta on immunohistochemical staining of iNOS and
eNOS in coronary arteries of ovariectomized rats.

AIM: The postmenopausal period is associated with increased risk for coronary
atherosclerosis, and the effect of hormone replacement therapy in reducing this
risk is controversial. Previous studies reported that nitric oxide synthetase
(NOS) level might be important for the development of atherosclerosis, but no
study has shown the interaction between hormone replacement therapy and
endothelial NOS and inducible NOS intensity on coronary arteries yet. Our goal
was to find out the immunostaining intensity of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS
in ovariectomized rats which received oestradiol and norethisterone treatment.
METHODS: We performed bilateral ovariectomy in 15, female, 90-day-old Wistar rats
with an average weight of 250 grams. After waiting for 4 weeks for the menopausal
state, they were divided into 3 groups to receive either placebo, 0.1 mg/day
17-beta-oestradiol (group E2), or 0.1 mg/day 17-beta-oestradiol + 0.1 mg/day
norethisterone acetate (group E2-NETA) for 5 weeks. Another group included 5,
normal, adult, female intact rats and served as controls. At the end of the
treatment, all rats were sacrificed and coronary arteries were stained with
inducible NOS and endothelial NOS polyclonal antibodies using streptavidin-biotin
technique.
RESULTS: The immunostaining of inducible NOS was prominent in perivascular
connective tissue of the ovariectomized group but not in the control group. The
inducible NOS immunostaining immunoreactivity was not detected in either treated 
groups. Immunostaining intensity of endothelial NOS did not differ in any 4
groups with similar staining.
CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that hormone replacement therapy
down-regulates iNOS expression in coronary arteries of ovariectomized rats, and
reduced iNOS may likely be involved in estrogen's beneficial effects.

Multihormonality and entrapment of islets in pancreatic endocrine tumors.

Kapran Y(1), Bauersfeld J, Anlauf M, Sipos B, Klöppel G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Capa, 
Istanbul, Turkey. ykapran@hotmail.com

We analyzed pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) from 200 patients for the
incidence of multihormonality and entrapped islets and correlated the results
with clinicopathological features. Our series included 86 cases (43%) of
functioning PET and 114 cases (57%) of nonfunctioning PET. Classified according
to the WHO classification, there were 32 well-differentiated benign PETs, 85
well-differentiated PETs with uncertain behavior, and 83 well-differentiated
malignant PETs. All tumors were immunostained for pancreatic hormones (insulin,
glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide) and for additional hormones
such as gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, calcitonin, seratonin, and
adrenocorticotropic hormone. Multihormonality was found in 34% of all PETs and it
was a frequent finding in the tumors of the uncertain behavior (38.8%) group.
Islet entrapment was found in 57 tumors (28.5%) and was significantly more
frequent in PETs with uncertain and malignant behavior than benign ones (p=0.01).
In 57 cases, we also investigated whether ductule entrapment accompanied islet
entrapment. Of these 57 tumors, 45 (79%) tumors had accompanying ductule
entrapment. Ductule entrapment did not show significant correlation with
malignancy and was a more frequent finding in nonfunctioning tumors. We conclude 
that the incidence of multihormonality in PETs is not as high as suggested
previously and islet entrapping may reflect aggressive tumor growth and may be a 
complementary criterion for predicting the biological behavior of PETs.

Analysis of NKX3.1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and correlation with
clinicopathologic features.

This study aimed to analyze NKX3.1 expression in tissue samples of benign
prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and in three different prostate cancer categories. The
correlation of NKX3.1 expression with clinical and pathologic features of
patients having undergone radical prostatectomy also was investigated. NKX3.1
expression was determined in tissue samples obtained from four different
histopathological categories: (1) from patients treated with transurethral
prostatectomy for BPH (n = 26), (2) localized prostate cancer patients subjected 
to radical prostatectomy (n = 38), (3) biopsy samples from prostate cancer
patients who were metastatic at the initial admission (n = 10), and (4) tissue
samples of prostate cancer patients administered antiandrogens, but who had
undergone transurethral prostatectomy for infravesical obstruction (n = 11).
Standard immunohistochemical staining was performed using an antiserum raised
against recombinant human NKX3.1. Staining was seen in all categories of
prostatic tissues. Immunohistochemistry staining scores were lower in prostate
cancer patients. The staining scores were significantly higher in patients with
BPH compared to metastatic or localized prostate cancer patients. Staining scores
of patients with BPH and of those under antiandrogen therapy were similar. No
significant correlation was found between NKX3.1 expression and tumor volume,
Gleason sum scores, the presence of extraprostatic extension, tumor stage, or
serum PSA. NKX3.1 expression is significantly decreased in prostate cancer
patients when compared to BPH. However, the decline of NKX3.1 expression was not 
correlated with prostate cancer progression and was not associated with advanced 
stage. Thus, NKX3.1 expression is not a clinically valuable prognostic factor.

Pathology, Kurupelit, 55200 Samsun, Turkey. mygulbahar@hotmail.com

The present study describes immunophenotypic characteristics of inflammatory
infiltrate in the skin and lung of lambs naturally infected with sheeppox virus
(SPV). Three lambs revealed typical cutaneous and pulmonary lesions of sheeppox. 
Histologically, cutaneous and pulmonary lesions consisted of hyperplastic and/or 
degenerative changes in the epithelium with mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and
typical sheeppox cells (SPCs), which had a vacuolated nucleus and marginated
chromatin with occasional granular intracytoplasmic inclusions. The inflammatory 
infiltrate in pox lesions in both skin and lung was characterized by the presence
of MHC II+ dendritic cells, CD4+, CD8+, gammadelta+ T cells, IgM+ cells, and
CD21+ cells. Loss of expression of MHC I and MHC II antigens was observed in the 
affected areas of skin and lung. SPCs, stained with anti-SPV antibody, were also 
positive for CD14 and CD172A, antigens expressed on monocytes and macrophages.
CD14 and CD172A negative SPCs were considered to be SPV infected degenerated
epithelial cells or fibroblasts.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms have been suggested as possible
determinants of bone mineral density (BMD) and calcium metabolism. In this study,
our aim was to determine whether there is an association between VDR gene
polymorphism and osteomalacia or not. We determined ApaI and TaqI polymorphisms
in the vitamin D receptor gene in 24 patients with osteomalacia and 25
age-matched healthy controls. Serum calcium, phosphorus, ALP, PTH, 25OHD levels
were also examined. We used PCR and RFLP methods to test for an association
between osteomalacia and polymorphisms within, intron 8 and exon 9 of the VDR
gene. When the control and patients were compared for their ApaI and TaqI
genotypes there was no relationship between VDR gene allelic polymorphisms and
osteomalacia. Whereas a nearly significant difference for A allele was found in
the allellic distribution of the patients (p=0.08). Also no association between
biochemical data and VDR gene polymorphisms was observed.

Lymphangiomas are benign malformations of the vessels. They are commonly located 
in the neck, axillary region and mediastinum. Lymphangioma of the adrenal gland
is very rare. These lesions were first discovered as incidental autopsy findings.
As the imaging techniques have improved, they now appear as incidental findings
at abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan examinations. They are 
usually asymptomatic. We present a 26-year-old woman admitted to the hospital,
complaining of weakness, putting on weight, and lumbago. Her laboratory findings 
were within normal limits. Radiological examination revealed a 7 cm cystic lesion
located in the right adrenal gland. Right adrenalectomy was performed.
Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis of the cystic
lesion was consistent with a lymphangioma.

Meningiomas are the most frequent benign tumors of the intracranial cavity. The
classification and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms have been reported to be
investigated by both pathological and genetic methods. In this study, we aimed to
detect 1p36 and 22qter deletions by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 
archival materials of 50 intracranial meningioma patients. The clinical material 
consisted of paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 50 patients who were
surgically treated and had histopathologic diagnosis of an intracranial
meningioma. We observed 1p36 deletion in 23/50 (46%) and 22qter deletion in 33/50
(66%) patients. In addition, we observed 22qter deletion in 26/36 (72.2%)
patients with meningothelial meningioma. This finding implies that 22qter
deletion might play an important role in the pathogenesis of meningothelial
meningioma. On the other hand, no alterations were documented in the frequency of
these chromosomal alterations according to the grade of meningiomas, suggesting
that malignant progression of these tumors depends on other, more relevant,
genetic changes.

Intracranial germ cell tumors are rarely seen and typically localize in the
pineal or suprasellar region. The largest category of germ cell tumors is the
germinoma. There have been reported associations of malignant tumors and
chromosomal abnormalities in germ cell tumors. In this study, we present a
22-year-old man with multiple congenital melanocytic nevi in association with
pineal tumor. Congenital melanocytic lesions greater than 2 cm were counted to be
54 in number, and those smaller than 1 cm in diameter were found to be 25 in
number. The pathological diagnosis of the pineal tumors was germinoma, and the
lesions located in the occipital region and trunk were compound congenital nevi. 
To our knowledge, a relationship between multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and
germ cell tumors has not been reported before. The connection between them
remains to be clarified.

OBJECTIVE: Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of
mental retardation associated with the immunologic and other known defects. Extra
chromosome 21 of DS patients contains an average of 40 extra copies of rRNA genes
and the in vivo regulation of these genes' activity is not known. Because over
80% of total cellular RNA is rRNA, the measurement of total cellular RNA provides
information on rRNA content. The aim of this work was to determine whether or not
the additional chromosome 21 causes any increase in total cellular RNA content in
mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMNCs) of these patients and whether or
not this content is modified with age.
METHOD: PBMNCs of 48 patients with DS and 48 healthy controls were studied. RNA
content of isolated PBMNCs was evaluated by flow cytometric measurements.
RESULTS: Average RNA content of younger DS patients' cells was significantly
higher than that of healthy controls (P=0.003). Furthermore, the RNA content
decreased significantly with increasing age of DS patients (r=-0.377, P=0.008) in
the range of 0-26 year old, whereas no significant relationship was found between
age and PBMNCs' RNA content of healthy controls in the same range of ages.
CONCLUSION: RNA content of PBMNCs from DS patients decreases rapidly with age.
This is the first work on the age-dependent decrease of the RNA content in PBMNCs
of DS patients.

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is the most commonly recognized respiratory
chain defect in childhood. The disease is clinically heterogeneous with
phenotypes including Leigh syndrome, hepatic failure and myopathies. COX
deficiency has been associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations in COX I, II, and
III with large-scale deletions of the mitochondrial genome and with point
mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes. Here we report on a 3.5-year-old girl with
a rare type of isolated myopathy due to COX deficiency.

We report two children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated 
with mitochondrial cytopathy (MC). Case 1 was diagnosed as MC with the findings
of ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, failure to thrive, high serum lactate and pyruvate
levels, ragged red fibers in muscle biopsy and the common 4.9 kb deletion in
mtDNA when she was four years old. She subsequently developed FSGS four years
later. Case 2 was a four month-old girl presenting with feeding difficulty from
birth, with vomiting, seizures and nystagmoid eye movements, nephrotic
proteinuria and hematuria. Renal biopsy revealed FSGS. Ultrastructural study
demonstrated markedly pleomorphic mitochondria in podocytes with a severe
effacement of foot processes. The analyses of muscle biopsy and skin fibroblasts 
for respiratory chain enzymes were found to be normal, while mitochondrial DNA
analysis revealed the population of a single deleted mtDNA in the heteroplasmic
state. The present cases illustrate FSGS as a rare renal complication of
mitochondrial disease and provide further evidence of podocytes possessing
abnormal mitochondria which may cause glomerular epithelial cell damage leading
to glomerulosclerosis.

The purpose of this study was to determine the protective effect of Anzer honey
on ethanol-induced increased vascular permeability in rats. Evan's Blue (EB) dye,
administered intracardiacly and extravasation of EB into the stomach, served as
an indicator of vascular permeability following exposure to alcohol. Ethanol was 
given orally to the ethanol group for 90 days, and N-etylmaleimide (NEM) was
given subcutaneously to the NEM group, and we observed increased extravasation of
EB in the stomach in both groups. For this reason, we used NEM as a positive
control for ethanol. Anzer honey, which contains 25.44 mg/g ascorbic acid, was
given to the honey+ethanol group orally 30 min before beginning the 90-day
ethanol administration. The mean amount of EB that leaked into the stomach of
rats in the ethanol group and the NEM group was higher than that of the control
group. Furthermore, if compared to the control, EB values in the stomachs were
significantly reduced when receiving honey before administration of ethanol in
rats. Histopathologically, the incidence and severity of gastric mucosal
congestion were significantly reduced in the honey+ethanol group when compared to
the ethanol group. These result indicate that Anzer honey is able to protect the 
stomach of the rat against ethanol-induced increased vascular permeability, which
may be correlated with the ascorbic acid content.

Comment in
    APMIS. 2007 Jun;115(6):769-71.

Surface epithelial-stromal cell tumors are the most common neoplasms of the ovary
but occurrence of a serous adenocarcinoma and an adult granulosa cell tumor in
the same ovary is an unusual incident. In the present case report we describe
this very uncommon occurrence in the ovary of a 50-year-old woman. The patient
suffered abdominal distention and was referred to the state hospital where a 5x3 
cm multilocular cystic lesion was observed on abdominal CT. Total abdominal
hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy was performed. Microscopy
revealed an adult granulosa cell tumor and a serous papillary adenocarcinoma in

Sciences, Ege University, Bornova-Izmir, Turkey. uzel@sci.ege.edu.tr

Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 occurrence has been investigated in 168 hot
water samples from 24 hotels, situated in 6 counties in Izmir province of Turkey,
from 15 June to 30 September of the year 2000. Sampling was carried out at 15-day
intervals and seven samples were taken from each of the hotels' hot water
reservoirs and hot water networks. The samples were (1 L) concentrated using
polycarbonate filters (mesh size 0.22 microm). Isolation was achieved using
selective medium, GVPC agar. The samples were concentrated by membrane
filtration, divided into three portions and cultured without pretreatment, after 
acid treatment, and after heat treatment, on GVPC agar. One hundred and ten
isolates were identified as L.pneumophila sg 1 using the Legionella Latex Test
(Oxoid). Arbitrarily primed PCR (AP PCR) was employed to assess the clonal
relationship between Legionella pneumophila sg 1 isolates from the hot water
samples of the hotels. Three genotypes of L. pneumophila sg 1 isolates were
identified. With a high prevalence of type A, 22 hotels were found to be
colonized with L. pneumophila serogroup 1, while only 2 were free from the
bacteria.

Elastofibroma is a rare entity most commonly seen in subscapular region.
Elastofibrolipoma was first described by De Nictolis et al (Am J Surg Pathol.
1995;19:364-367) as a capsulated mass, composed of mature fat, abnormal elastic
fibers, and connective tissue, at the anterior mediastinum. A 57-year-old woman
with a periscapular pain and a mass at the left subscapular region was admitted
at the department of thoracic surgery. Histologic sections of the
well-circumscribed 6.5 x 5 x 3.5-cm rubbery mass revealed a collagenous stroma
containing eosinophilic globules and fragmented fibers intermixed with mature
adipose tissue surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. The elastic nature of these 
eosinophilic fibers and globules was confirmed with Verhoeff's elastic stain. The
lesion was diagnosed as elastofibrolipoma, a recently recognized lesion with an
unclear origin. Here we discuss if it is a variant of elastofibroma or lipoma.

The gross and histopathologic lesions of meningoencephalitis tuberculosa in a
4-year-old Holstein cow showing clinical signs compatible with bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy are described in this report. Grossly, numerous gray to yellow,
firm and caseous nodules were seen on the ventral surfaces of the brain and in
the lateral and fourth ventricles. Histopathologically, foci of caseation and
dystrophic mineralization were surrounded by multinucleated giant cells,
epitheloid macrophages, plasma cells, lymphocytes and fibrous proliferation.
Ziehl-Neelsen stains of the lesions revealed masses of slender acid-fast bacilli 
in the necrotic centers of lesions and within surrounding giant cells.

Zimmermann-Laband syndrome is an inherited disorder that is characterized by
abnormalities of the head, face, hands, and feet. Most children with this
disorder have generalized hypertrichosis, large gingivae, and hypoplasia of the
fingernails and toenails. We report a male infant who exhibited typical features 
of Zimmermann-Laband syndrome with an unusual histopathologic finding. Excised
tissue from the infant's gingivae showed papillary projections that were composed
of hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium with different amounts of
keratinization.

Number and location of nucleoli and presence of apoptotic bodies in
diagnostically challenging cases of prostate adenocarcinoma on needle biopsy.

Aydin H(1), Zhou M, Herawi M, Epstein JI.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Baskent University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

There is limited published data regarding the significance of the number or
position of nucleoli and the presence of apoptotic bodies in diagnostically
challenging cases of adenocarcinoma of the prostate on needle biopsy material.
One hundred consecutive prostate cancers on needle biopsy were sent because of
diagnostic difficulty to an expert in urological pathology, and the remaining
normal benign prostatic glands on the same core were evaluated for the number and
location of nucleoli and for the presence of mitotic figures and apoptotic
bodies. The Gleason scores of the cases were 6 (86%), 7 (9%), and 8 to 10 (5%).
For comparison, the same parameters were evaluated in mimickers of cancer on
needle biopsy from other cases, including partial atrophy (n = 135), fully
developed atrophy (n = 89), adenosis (n = 50), prostate glands with acute
inflammation (n = 50), and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (n =
100). Findings were recorded under high dry magnification (x40) using hematoxylin
and eosin-stained sections. Although the number and position of nucleoli did not 
discriminate between cancer and benign mimickers, mitotic figures and apoptotic
bodies were more commonly seen in cancer. Apoptotic bodies in particular were
seen fairly frequently (34%) in prostatic adenocarcinoma (also seen in 13% of
high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), yet rarely in benign mimickers
on needle biopsy. Our findings indicate that the presence of apoptotic bodies
should be added to the list of histological features that are helpful in the
diagnosis of challenging cases of prostate cancer on needle biopsy.

patients with prostate cancer.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Izmir,

The aim of the study was to investigate immunohistochemically the expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in untreated and androgen-deprived
patients with prostate cancer. The study included 20 patients with prostate
cancer who had undergone transurethral prostatectomy due to infravesical
obstruction. All patients had been receiving androgen deprivation therapy for at 
least 3 months. Transurethral prostatectomy specimens were examined for VEGF
expression after androgen deprivation, and the biopsy samples of the same
patients were used for the evaluation of VEGF expression before androgen
deprivation. VEGF expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Staining
patterns determined by the staining scores were compared before and after
treatment. The correlation of VEGF expression with PSA, Gleason score, and the
percent change in PSA after treatment was also investigated. Eligible biopsy
specimens were available in 15 of the 20 patients, allowing for the evaluation of
VEGF expression before treatment. All prostate cancer specimens were positive.
VEGF was localized mainly in the cytoplasm or on the membrane of carcinoma cells.
Staining was strong in 86.7% of patients before androgen deprivation.
Heterogeneous staining (strong in 25%, moderate in 35%, and weak in 40%) was
observed after treatment. Staining scores were significantly higher in patients
before androgen deprivation and showed a significant decrease after androgen
deprivation (p = 0.007). Tumor staining correlated with Gleason score. No
significant correlation was determined between VEGF expression and pre-treatment 
PSA and percent change of PSA after treatment. Immunohistochemical results
indicate that VEGF expression is downregulated by androgen deprivation therapy.
VEGF may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer.

Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare neoplasm that most often involves the pleura.
The increasing numbers of this neoplasm have also been reported to date in
extrapleural sites. We report a case of a twenty-four-year-old female with right 
frontal mass. Histologically, the tumor composed of spindle cell proliferation.
Tumor cells were found to be positive for CD34 and CD117 with immunohistochemical
studies. Ten months follow-up was uneventful. Seventy seven cases of meningeal
solitary fibrous tumor from the literature are analysed and pathological,
immunohistochemical and clinical features are discussed. Solitary fibrous tumor
has a slight female predominance, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.5. Age
distribution is similar to meningioma ranging from 7-81 years. Approximately 23% 
of cases originate in the spine which is the most common meningeal location.
Histopathologic examination shows uniform spindle cell proliferation with various
amount of collagen. CD34-positivity usually allows discrimination from
schwannomas, meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas. A differential diagnosis is
important because most of the solitary fibrous tumors usually behave in a benign 
fashion. In this study, we also showed CD117 (Kit) expression in a case of
meningeal SFT. CD117-positivity can be a good strategy for treatment in malignant
and recurrent cases. Further investigations are necessary for therapeutic
implication of CD117-positivity in SFT.

Skull metastasis must be kept in mind when considering the differential diagnosis
of a skull tumor. Skull metastases cause local swelling that is usually painless,
and rarely they lead to neurologic dysfunction. Despite the fact that
hematogenous skull metastases can be caused by nearly all types of tumors (lung, 
prostate, thyroid carcinoma, malignant melanoma), breast cancer is associated
with the highest rate of metastatic skull lesions. We report an extremely rare
case of skull metastasis from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in a 65-year-old
woman, presented with painless frontoparietal scalp swelling which developed
within three months. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case
involving the skull secondary to a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and the first case 
when skull metastasis was the first evidence of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Determination of apoptosis through bax expression in cryptorchid testis: an
experimental study.

Author information:

The aim was to determine the expression of Bax in germ cells of rats with
unilateral experimental cryptorchidism, and to evaluate the role of apoptosis in 
germ cell loss. Twenty-one prepubertal rats were randomly subdivided into three
groups after the execution of the left cryptorchidism model. Group 1 (n=8), group
2 (n=6) and group 3 (n=7) rats were killed at the end of the first, second and
third month, respectively. Bax expression was assessed in Sertoli cells,
spermatogonia and spermatocytes by immunohistochemistry. Percentages of Bax
expression in spermatocytes and spermatogonia were decreased in the left
testicles in the 2nd and 3rd months compared to results obtained in the 1st month
(p<0.05). Percentage of Bax expression in the left testicles of group 1, at the
level of both spermatogonia and spermatocytes was higher than that in the right
one (p<0.05). However, in groups 2 and 3, the higher Bax expression on the left
side was only seen in the spermatocytes (p<0.05). In all groups, the mean weight 
of the left testicle was lower than that of the scrotal counterpart where the
difference was significant only in groups 1 and 3 (p<0.05). The weight of the
left and right testicles was increasing with time. In this model of
cryptorchidism, the affected testis had a decreased weight compared to the normal
one. Based on the increased Bax expression, we think that apoptosis may play a
role in the germ cell loss.

Accuracy and diagnostic yield of stereotactic biopsy in the diagnosis of brain
masses: comparison of results of biopsy and resected surgical specimens.

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the diagnostic yield and
accuracy of stereotactic biopsy in patients harboring brain mass. Stereotactic
biopsy was performed in 130 patients between 1995 and 2000 in an educational and 
research hospital in Turkey. The results of histological analysis were compared
to the resected specimens in 23 patients. The lesions were lobar in 62% of cases 
and deep-seated in 38% of cases. During the biopsy procedures, the pathologist
was in the operating theatre and a very small fragment was used for cytological
examination. No frozen section was used in any of the cases. Samples were
diagnostic in 122 cases. The overall diagnostic yield of the procedure was 94%. A
definitive histological diagnosis was not made in eight patients. The
histological diagnoses of the two procedures were identical (complete agreement) 
in 16 cases. In three cases, the histological diagnoses between the two
procedures were slightly different without impact on patient care (minor
disagreement). The diagnosis of the stereotactic biopsy was completely changed
after craniotomy in four cases (major disagreement). The accuracy of the
histological diagnosis was 83%. There was only one major complication, which
involved intracerebral hemorrhage. Despite the limited number of patients who
underwent resection, our data suggest that stereotactic biopsy of brain masses is
a safe and accurate technique that can obtain adequate tissue for histological
diagnosis, thus providing the best avaible treatment for patients. Cytological
evaluation of the streotactic biopsy also is a highly effective tool for
obtaining sufficient material during the procedure in many cases.

The incidence of tuberculosis in Western countries is rising, and continued
vigilance together with an awareness of its protean manifestations is essential. 
Cutaneous tuberculosis is a relatively rare manifestation of the disease,
accounting for only 1% of extrapulmonary cases of tuberculosis and 0.14% of all
reported cases of tuberculosis. A 19-year-old male patient was admitted to our
clinic with skin lesions both at the front and at the back of his body. With
clinical findings, histopathology, polymerase chain reaction, PA lung graph, and 
computerised tomography, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic tuberculosis
abscess associated with lung tuberculosis and Pott's disease. Antituberculosis
drugs were administered. An increased awareness of the re-emergence of cutaneous 
tuberculosis will allow for the proper diagnosis and management of this
increasing common skin disorder.

We presented a polypoid leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei having atypical endometrial
stromal cells adjacent to the leiomyoma. Although atypical stromal cells of the
female genital tract have been described, to our knowledge, no lesion identical
to ours has been reported thus far. These atypical cells may be mistaken for
malignant cells on histologic examination, especially in small endometrial
samples. To differentiate these kinds of atypical-featured lesions from sarcoma
is important, especially in curettage materials. The etiology and precise nature 
of multinucleated giant cells and atypical stromal cells in the endometrium are
unclear. To prevent radical surgery, pathologists must be familiar with these
atypical cells in the female genital tract.

Diagnosis of oligodendroglioma from other clear cell neoplasms of central nervous
system (CNS) is still challenging despite advances in neuroradiology and
molecular diagnostic tools. Herein, we present a 44-year-old male patient who had
a diagnosis of right parietal oligodendroglioma grade II in 1994 which recurred
in 2002. He presented with intratumoral hemorrhage and he underwent radical
resection of tumor in 2003. Histopathological examination of the recurrent tumor 
showed anaplastic progression with confusing immunohistochemical (IHC) results;
the tumor was positive for NeuN and synaptophysin staining. The question arisen
was whether the recurrent tumor was an oligodendroglioma with neuronal
differentiation or an extraventricular neurocytoma initially misdiagnosed as
oligodendroglioma. Repeated IHC staining showed negative results for NeuN and
synaptophysin. Chromosomal analysis revealed 1p/19q deletion, which led to the
diagnosis ofanaplastic oligodendroglioma grade III. Accurate diagnosis of
oligodendroglioma is crucial due to recent advances and promises in its
treatment. Current diagnostic methods of oligodendroglial tumors are discussed in
context of differentiating oligodendrogliomas from other clear cell neoplasms of 
CNS, especially from extraventricular neurocytomas.

Correlation between histological grade and MIB-1 and p53 immunoreactivity in
meningiomas.

Ozen O(1), Demirhan B, Altinörs N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara,
Turkey. ozlemo@baskent-ank.edu.tr

OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas for the most part are slow-growing benign tumors, but
complete removal can be difficult and recurrence is an issue. The aim of this
study was to re-evaluate tumors diagnosed as meningioma previously in our
hospital, according to the latest World Health Organization classification. We
also examined the relationships among parameters such as brain invasion,
histological grade and Ki-67 and p53 expression in these tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Meningioma biopsy specimens numbering 60 (48 grade I, 11
grade II, and 1 grade III tumors) were examined immunohistochemically using
monoclonal antibodies for Ki-67 (MIB-1) and p53 protein. The MIB-1 labeling index
(LI) for each tumor was calculated as a percentage based on the number of stained
cells per total cells counted. The level of p53 expression in each sample was
semiquantatively evaluated as < 1%, 1 - 10%, 10 - 70%, or > 70%. Any value > 1%
was accepted as presence of p53 expression.
RESULTS: Of the 60 meningiomas, 7 (11.7%) exhibited brain invasion. The mean
MIB-1 LI values for the grade I and grade II tumors were 1.1% and 2.3%,
respectively. The corresponding levels of p53 protein expression in these groups 
were 54.1% and 72.7%. The MIB-1 LI and the level of p53 expression in the one
grade III meningioma were 6.7% and 10 - 70%, respectively. Histological grade was
significantly correlated with MIB-1 LI and with p53 expression (p < 0.01 for
both). Brain invasion was not correlated with histological grade, MIB-1 LI, or
p53 expression.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that MIB-1 LI and p53 protein expression are
good indicators of histological grade in meningioma and may be particularly
valuable for distinguishing borderline atypical meningiomas. The number of cases 
was limited, but the findings also suggest that brain invasion is a prognostic
parameter independent of grade, MIB-1 LI and p53 expression.

A relationship between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and the pathogenesis
of colorectal cancer has been reported in recent studies. Moreover, it has been
indicated that COX-2 expression may have a prognostic role in colorectal cancer
patients. In this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of COX-2
expression in 83 patients with colorectal cancer. COX-2 expression was assessed
using immunohistochemical methods and was evaluated by grading both staining
intensity and staining extension. The relationships between COX-2 expression and 
clinicopathological features of the patients and patient survival were evaluated.
There was no relationships between COX-2 expression and tumor size (tm < 3 cm or 
tm > or = 3 cm), tumor histopathological differentiation (poorly differentiated
or moderately + well differentiated), number of metastatic lymph nodes (< 4 or 3 
> or = 4), histopathology of the tumor, localization of the tumor (colon or
rectum), distant metastasis, and vascular invasion of the tumor. In the
multivariate analysis, COX-2 expression was not found as an independent
prognostic factor. We demonstrated that COX-2 expression was not correlated with 
clinicopathological characteristics of colon carcinoma and disease outcome.

Among the epithelial renal tumours with eosinophilic cytoplasm, the main
differential diagnostic problem arises between renal oncocytomas (ROs) and
eosinophilic variants of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). We
investigated the possible role of anti-mitochondrial (AMA), anti-caveolin 1
(CAV1), anti-CD63 (CD63) and anti-cytokeratin 14 (CK14) antibodies in the
differential diagnosis of eosinophilic epithelial tumours and applied the Muller 
and Mowry modification of Hale's colloidal iron stain (HCI). Thirty-five ROs and 
77 eosinophilic RCCs (27 chromophobe, 28 clear cell and 22 papillary RCCs) were
included in this study. Apical and/or polar CD63 immunostaining (94%) and diffuse
AMA (91%) and CAV1 (88%) immunostainings were the characteristics of ROs, whereas
diffuse CD63 immunostaining (96%) and diffuse-peripheral AMA (96%) and CAV1 (92%)
immunostainings were characteristic immunohistochemical features of eosinophilic 
chromophobe RCCs. We showed CK14 antibody not to be useful in the differential
diagnosis of the eosinophilic epithelial renal tumours. The staining
localisations with AMA, CAV1 and CD63 antibodies were significantly different
between tumour groups. AMA had 96% sensitivity and 94% specificity, whereas CAV1 
had 92% sensitivity and 97% specificity in diagnosing chromophobe RCCs. With HCI 
staining, ROs, showing apical and/or polar staining, could be differentiated from
chromophobe RCCs, showing diffuse cytoplasmic staining. HCI had fairly low (69%) 
sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas CD63 had 95% sensitivity and 100%
specificity to diagnose ROs. We recommend using CD63 as the best marker of choice
for distinguishing ROs from eosinophilic chromophobe RCCs when standard
diagnostic criteria are not helpful.

AIM: To investigate the morphology and function of platelets in nephropathic
cystinosis (NC).
METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 6.5 years; SD, 20 months) with NC were
investigated. Their platelets were examined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and the characteristics of the dense granules (DGs) were determined by
mepacrine labelling and the uranaffin reaction. Bleeding time, turbidometric
aggregation, and luminescence aggregation were studied and intraplatelet cystine 
was measured.
RESULTS: Increased intraplatelet cystine, primary and secondary aggregation
defects, and the absence of ATP release were demonstrated. TEM revealed DGs of
various shapes and sizes and lamellary or amorphous cytoplasmic inclusions.
Viscous material had been released into the vacuolar spaces and enlarged open
canalicular system. Mepacrine labelling revealed that the numbers of DGs/platelet
were comparable between the patients and the controls (mean, 2.9 (SD, 0.22) v
3.32 (0.18); p = 0.34). The uranaffin reaction revealed that the numbers of type 
1, 3, and 4 DGs were comparable between the patients and the controls, but that
there were fewer type 2 DGs in the patients (mean, 8.5 (SD, 1.95) v 17.22 (1.58);
p = 0.01). TEM for platelet aggregation revealed a lack of induction and/or
defective execution and/or delayed transmission. The patients' intraplatelet
cystine concentrations were higher than the controls (mean, 1.56 (SD, 0.84) v
0.08 (0.01) nmol/mg protein; p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to demonstrate raised intraplatelet
cystine, abnormal platelet ultrastructural findings, and defective aggregation in
NC.

AIMS: To investigate the value of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), an
indicator of stellate cell activation, in predicting fibrosis in chronic
hepatitis B (CHB) patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The liver biopsy specimens of 30 patients with a clinical
diagnosis of CHB were obtained before treatment and scored by Knodell's
histological activity index. The specimens were then immunohistochemically
stained with alpha-SMA and semiquantitatively evaluated. Fibrosis and the
immunoreactivity of alpha-SMA in the periportal, perisinusoidal and pericentral
areas were compared. Fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity in CHB patients were
significantly correlated (P =0.022). Furthermore, the degree of alpha-SMA
expression and the scores of fibrosis (in periportal, perisinusoidal and
pericentral areas) were highly correlated (P =0.000, 0.001, 0.000, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In liver biopsy samples, alpha-SMA may prove to be a valuable marker
in the evaluation of stellate cell activation and fibrosis progression and an
early indicator of the development of fibrosis.

Large cell carcinoma of the lung with a rhabdoid phenotype is very rare. We
present a 55-year-old man with multiple nodules in his lung. He had an emergency 
operation because of abundant hemoptysis. The microscopic appearance was a large 
cell carcinoma with a pure rhabdoid phenotype. There were no foci of any other
carcinomatous components. Tumor cells had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmic
globules and eccentric nuclei and did not adhere to each other. Histochemically, 
these cells were periodic acid-Schiff-negative. Immunohistochemically, vimentin
and neuron-specific enolase were positive. Epithelial membrane antigen was
focally and weakly positive, p53 was positive in 60% of tumoral cells, and Ki-67 
(MIB-1 labeling index) was 50%. The patient died of disseminated disease 2 months
after the operation.

Malignant struma ovarii is a rare form of the ovarian germ cell tumors. Hence,
diagnosis and management of malignant struma ovarii have not been clearly
defined. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman with papillary carcinoma
arising in struma ovarii. The malignant component of this tumor was detected
after laparoscopic removal, and a re-staging operation was performed afterwards. 
There was no evidence of clinical malignancy or metastases. In this paper,
clinical features, treatment guidelines, diagnostic features, and
immunohistochemical characteristics of this tumor are reviewed.

Aspects of oxalosis associated with aspergillosis in pathology specimens.

Inciralti-Izmir, Turkey. ugur.pabuccuoglu@deu.edu.tr

Oxalosis (calcium oxalate deposition) is associated with various conditions,
including aspergillosis. Some Aspergillus species produce oxalic acid, which
reacts with blood or tissue calcium to precipitate calcium oxalate. Calcium
oxalate crystals exhibit various shapes and are strongly birefringent. These
occur in cytological specimens, as well as in tissues of patients with
Aspergillus infection. Aspergillus species are hyaline septate moulds, and they
can be accurately recognized in pathology specimens only if conidial heads
(fruiting heads) are present. When these structures are not observed, detection
of associated oxalosis in a mould infection supports the pathological diagnosis
of aspergillosis. The presence of oxalosis is helpful when microbiological
identification or immunohistological techniques for fungi are not available.
Calcium oxalate crystals can induce cellular injury by several mechanisms, and
there is increasing evidence that oxalosis-induced tissue damage may occasionally
lead to a poor clinical outcome. This review discusses the diagnostic value and
the potential clinical significance of oxalosis associated with aspergillosis.

Reactive nodular fibrous pseudotumor involving the pelvic and abdominal cavity: a
case report and review of literature.

Saglam EA(1), Usubütün A, Kart C, Ayhan A, Küçükali T.

There are several entities that can present with multiple nodular lesions within 
the peritoneal cavity, such as "disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis,"
"peritoneal fibrosis," "calcifying fibrous pseudotumor," and the recently
described lesion of "reactive nodular fibrous pseudotumor of the gastrointestinal
tract and mesentery." Here we present one such lesion in a 28-year-old woman with
a history of dysmenorrhea and ergotamine use for migraine attacks. Intraoperative
exploration of our patient disclosed numerous nodules located throughout the
pelvic and abdominal peritoneum. Histopathologically, these lesions were
fibrocollagenous nodules composed of sparse wavy spindle cells within hyalinized 
"keloid-like" collagen surrounded by an inflammatory infiltrate. Some of the
nodules were associated with small foci of endometriosis. We believe this lesion 
is best described by the term "reactive nodular fibrous pseudotumor" and that
endometriosis and the use of ergotamine derivatives may be contributing factors.

The role of cytokeratin 19 in the differential diagnosis of true papillary
carcinoma of thyroid and papillary carcinoma-like changes in Graves' disease.

Turkey. serk52@yahoo.com

Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease predominantly seen in females. All types
of thyroid cancers may co-exist with Graves' disease but papillary carcinoma is
the most frequent. Vesicular nuclei, nuclear grooves, and papillary formations
that may be seen in Graves' disease may lead the pathologist to an overdiagnosis 
of papillary carcinoma. The differential diagnosis between a true papillary
carcinoma and foci mimicking papillary carcinoma in Graves' disease may be
challenging by light microscopic features only. This study is designed to
determine whether CK19 is effective in the discrimination between the true
papillary carcinoma of thyroid and foci resembling papillary carcinoma in Graves'
disease. Twenty-five cases with papillary carcinoma and 25 cases with Graves'
disease containing foci resembling papillary carcinoma were included in the
study. All 25 cases with papillary carcinoma stained positive with CK19, whereas 
only six of 25 cases with Graves' disease showed weak staining, and the remaining
19 cases were completely negative. It is known that CK19 may show faint staining 
in benign thyroid lesions such as adenomas. Staining pattern with CK19 together
with histopathological findings may be helpful in the differential diagnosis
between foci mimicking papillary carcinoma and true papillary carcinoma in
Graves' disease.

Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for renal damage due to its effects
on small interlobular arteries. We investigated the effects of long-term passive 
smoking on renal vascular structures in healthy rats exposed to smoke soon after 
birth. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats (21 males and 21 females) exposed to passive
smoking comprised the experimental group and 33 non-exposed rats (17 males and 16
females) comprised the control group. The number of renal vessels, as well as the
level of glomerular capillary sclerosis, hyalinosis of arterioles, and myointimal
hyperplasia of arteries was assessed in renal biopsy specimens. The mean number
of renal vessels in male and female rats exposed to passive smoke (21.71 and
13.81, respectively) did not significantly differ from the mean number of renal
vessels in male and female control rats (22.47 and 13.06, respectively) (p>0.05).
Levels of glomerulosclerosis, hyalinosis, and myointimal hyperplasia also did not
differ between the experimental and control groups (p>0.05). Histopathologic
evidence of renal vascular damage was not found in young rats exposed to passive 
smoke for 4 months. A longer or higher degree of exposure to cigarette smoke
components may be required before such changes manifest, and aging and primary
renal disease may play a role.

The effect of tumor invasion patterns on pathologic stage of bladder urothelial
carcinomas.

Author information:

The aim of this study was to investigate tumor invasion pattern, its
heterogeneity and association with histopathological features and stage in
invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. We studied 62 cases of invasive
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. World Health Organization (WHO) 1973,
WHO/ISUP 1998 and WHO 1999 systems were used for tumor grading. Pathologic
staging of each case was done according to 1997 TNM system. During evaluation of 
the slides three main tumor invasion patterns were detected: "nodular",
"trabecular" and "infiltrative". In addition, homogeneity or heterogeneity of
invasion patterns was also recorded for each case. Of sixty-two invasive cases,
17 (27%) had nodular, 36 (58%) trabecular, and 9 (15%) infiltrative invasion
pattern. There was a statistically significant difference between invasion
patterns in relation to pathologic stage (pT) (p=0.001), but not to grade. Of the
17 cases with nodular invasion pattern and 36 tumors with trabecular invasion
pattern, 13 (77%) and 26 (72%) were pT1, respectively, whereas 8 of 9
infiltrative cases (89%) were advanced stage (pT2-3). According to heterogeneity,
forty-two cases (68%) had homogeneous, while the remaining 20 (32%) had
heterogeneous invasion pattern. Of the 42 homogeneous cases 34 (81%) were pT1,
whereas 14 of 20 heterogeneous cases (70%) were advanced stage (p=0.000). The
different invasion patterns seem to have a large impact on pathologic stage,
especially the infiltrative pattern. In addition, invasion heterogeneity appears 
to be of value in determination of biologic aggressiveness in urothelial
carcinoma.

The FHIT and WWOX genes encompass the FRA3B and FRA16D fragile sites at
chromosomes 3p14.2 and 16q23.3, respectively. Reduced Fhit and Wwox expression
has been reported in approximately two-thirds of invasive breast tumors.
Expression of these fragile gene products, as well as ErbB2 and p53, were
evaluated immunohistochemically in 44 pure and 31 adjacent-to-invasive ductal
carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) cases. Reduced Fhit and Wwox expression were observed in
(i) 70% and 68% of pure DCIS; (ii) 52% and 55% of DCIS adjacent-to-invasive tumor
cases; and (iii) 20% and 50% of adjacent normal tissue in pure DCIS cases.
Reduced Wwox expression in adjacent normal tissue was observed in 30% of cases in
the DCIS adjacent-to-invasive group. Reduced Fhit and Wwox expression was
observed in 61% of adjoining invasive tumors. In all normal, pure DCIS, and DCIS 
adjacent-to-invasive lesions, Fhit and Wwox expression was positively associated 
(P = 0.034, P = 0.042, P = 0.004, respectively) and in the invasive component
there was a positive trend toward association (P = 0.075). Fhit and Wwox were
more frequently reduced in high-grade lesions in the DCIS adjacent-to-invasive (P
= 0.025, P = 0.004, respectively). In the pure DCIS group, there was a
statistically significant negative association between Fhit and ErbB2 expression 
in DCIS (P = 0.035). In summary, reduced Fhit and Wwox expression in in-situ
breast cancer was associated, which may contribute to the high-grade
DCIS-invasive tumor pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To detect whether there is a relationship between the presence
ofActinomyces-like organisms (ALOs) and cytologic findings.
STUDY DESIGN: Papanicolaou-stained smears from 2290 women were examined
cytologically. Nineteen (0.83%) of the 2290 were diagnosed with ALOs and became
the study group. Patients without infectious agents (n=1792) were the control
group. Statistical analyses were conducted with the chi2 test using the SPSS
program (Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.).
RESULTS: The study and control groups were compared statistically. There was a
significant correlation between the presence of ALOs and other cytologic
findings, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, cocci, pseudoeosinophilia, endocervical 
cells, superficial cells, lactobacilli and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (p <
0.05), but there was no statistically significant difference between the presence
of ALOs and metaplastic cells, parabasal cells or nuclear changes (p > 0. 05).
CONCLUSION: ALOs in cervicovaginal smears might provide a milieu for growing some
infectious agents, such as Trichomonas vaginalis and cocci. Lactobacilli were
less plentiful in these cases. Vaginal discharge and abdominal pain were also
important clinicalfindings for the detection ofALOs. Another finding was
long-term usage of intrauterine contraceptive devices, which can cause the
overgrowth of ALOs in vaginal mucosa.

Elevated amounts of cell-free nucleic acids are detected in the circulation of
cancer patients. The type and pattern of these may vary depending on the origin. 
Recently, we described the presence of circulating fragmented nucleosomal DNA. In
the present study, our aim was to investigate the association between nucleosomal
DNA, caspase-3 expression and circulating caspase-3 mRNA, the primary activator
of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by gel
electrophoresis, and caspase-3 was analyzed by RT-PCR. Plasma samples from 65% of
patients were positive for nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, whereas none of the
healthy controls showed DNA fragmentation (P = 0.0004). Expression of caspase-3
differed significantly between the cases and controls (P < 0.0001). However, we
observed no direct correlation between nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and
caspase-3 expression in lymphocytes (P = 0.145). Circulating plasma caspase-3
mRNA was detected by nested RT-PCR, and no significant difference was observed
between the patients and the control group (P = 0.5). Our results indicate that
caspase-3 expression is increased in lymphocytes from patients. When compared to 
healthy individuals, no differences were observed in the amount of circulating
mRNA. These findings suggest that nucleosomal DNA fragmentation is not correlated
with elevated levels of apoptosis and circulating caspase-3 mRNA in circulating
tumor cells.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis ( JHF ) is a rare autosomal recessive disease
characterized by papulonodular skin lesions, gingival hyperplasia, joint
contractures, and bone lesions. The skin lesions may consist of multiple large
tumors, commonly on the scalp and around the neck, and small pearly, pink papules
and plaques on the trunk, chin, ears, and around the nostrils. Here, we report a 
2-year-old boy with characteristic stiffness of the knees and elbows and pink
confluent papules on the paranasal folds, and periauricular and perianal regions.
He also had hard nodules all over the scalp and around the mouth, and severe
gingival hyperplasia. The lesions were totally excised and clinicopathological
diagnosis was JHF.

The role of calcium independent inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in breast 
carcinoma is controversial, and the implications of iNOS expression on prognosis 
are not known. In this study, we aimed to investigate the significance of
immunohistochemical iNOS expression in 100 invasive ductal carcinomas. In
addition, 11 normal breast tissues, 20 cases of usual ductal hyperplasias (UDHs) 
and 20 fibroadenomas were included. We found that 78% of malignant and 75% of
benign cases showed iNOS immunoreactivity. However, the intensity and the
quantity of iNOS expression were significantly higher in the cancer group when
compared with benign breasts (P<0.001), suggesting a role of iNOS in breast
carcinogenesis. We were unable to show a correlation between iNOS expression and 
tumor grade, axillary lymph node status, and estrogen receptor expression. In 50 
axilla negative cases having 5--12 years follow-up, disease free survival (DFS)
rate was significantly lower in cases showing strong iNOS expression (P=0.05). As
strong iNOS expression was correlated with short DFS, we concluded that further
studies would be necessary to elucidate if iNOS expression might be a useful
prognostic marker in breast carcinoma, especially in the axilla negative group.

Violence is a significant public health problem. Thus, so as to prevent this
problem, homicide, the severest form of violence depriving a human being of his
right to live, deserves a detailed examination. This study is a retrospective
research examining the 2951 cases of medicolegal autopsies in Adana during a
period of 5 years (1997-2001). Among these cases, 620, which were determined to
be homicidal, were taken into the scope of this study. The cases were examined
with respect to sex, age groups, the method used during the act of homicide, the 
number and the localization of the wounds on the body. A total of 620 (21%) of
the medicolegal autopsies conducted within this period were homicides. Of these
cases, 515 (83.06%) were male and 105 (16.94%) female, and the rate of the males 
to females was 4.9; 72.74% of the victims were between the ages of 21 and 50. It 
was seen that 54.83% of the homicides involved firearms, while 35.16% of the
victims were stabbed to death with a cutting object. It was also determined that 
the victims suffered a single wound in 47.35% of firearm-related murders and
29.35% of stabbings resulted in death. Alcohol was found in the blood of 7.58% of
the homicide victims, while none had any illicit drugs.

Spontaneous infarction of a pleomorphic adenoma in parotid gland: diagnostic
problems and review.

Author information:

and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. kbehzatoglu@hotmail.com

Although infarction of parotid gland pleomorphic adenoma (PA) following
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has been well-documented, spontaneous infarction of 
PA has remained as an uncommon entity in the literature. To our knowledge, we
report the second case of spontaneous infarction occurring in a parotid gland PA.
A 44-yr-old man presented with a 2-yr history of slowly enlarging right parotid
mass, which had become painful 1 mo before performing FNA biopsy. Smears revealed
abundant necrotic debris, atypical squamous cells, and small cells with dark
nuclei suggestive of a carcinoma. Histologic examination of the tissue fragments 
demonstrated degenerated clusters of cells and chondromyxoid matrix. The
parotidectomy specimen had features consistent with those of an infarcted PA.
Although appears to be rare, spontaneous infarction of PA should be considered in
the differential diagnosis, since necrosis may mimic carcinoma and cause
misinterpretation of necrosis as an indication of malignancy, in an otherwise
benign salivary gland neoplasm.

onguruo@yahoo.com

Desmoplastic ganglioglioma is a rare, markedly desmoplastic variant of
ganglioglioma that usually presents in the first year of life. It is a mixed
glial and neuronal cerebral tumor. A few cases of desmoplastic ganglioglioma have
been reported in non-infantile patients. We report a case of desmoplastic
ganglioglioma in a 14-year-old boy. The patient presented with a large solid
cystic mass with mild peritumoral edema in the right posterior parieto-occipital 
region with direct contact to the falx cerebri. Histopathological examination
revealed a low-grade glial tumor with prominent desmoplasia including
hypocellular collagenous areas. The tumor was well demarcated with respect to the
surrounding brain. Ganglion cells with dysplastic features were present in the
tumor and clustered in some areas. Focal lymphocytic infiltration was also
observed. Mitotic activity was very low. Immunohistochemistry revealed glial
fibrillary acidic protein positivity in the astrocytic cells hidden in the
desmoplastic tissue. Synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase were positive in
ganglion-like neuronal cells. The MIB-1 labeling index was less than 1%. This
present case confirms that desmoplastic ganglioglioma can be present in young
adult patients with its characteristic radiologic features.

Ovarian ependymoma.

Erdoğan G(1), Ozel E, Peştereli HE, Salar Z, Tirak B, Karaveli S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya,
Turkey.

A 76-year-old woman presented with a large calcifying mass behind the bladder.
The tumor contained solid areas of a yellowish white color. Microscopic
examination revealed highly cellular solid areas with many typical ependymal
perivascular pseudorosettes. The cells contained uniform round-to-oval nuclei,
some of which had irregular contours, clumped chromatin and occasional prominent 
nucleoli. There was widespread geographic necrosis and there were 5 atypical
mitotic figures per 10 high power fields. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
immunopositivity was observed in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Based on the
histopathologic and immunohistochemical features, the tumor was diagnosed as an

Fungal infections have increased dramatically in recent years and candidemia is a
major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs).
Candidemia has been considered to be a nosocomial infection that is strongly
associated with neutropenia, recent surgery or presence of intravascular lines,
and previous colonization is an independent risk factor. We evaluated the in
vitro efficacy of fluconazole and amphotericin B against yeasts isolated from
various clinical specimens of colonized or infected patients treated in the ICUs 
of the Institute of Cardiology, Istanbul University. A total of 1397 ICU patients
were treated at the Institute of Cardiology between January 2000 and December
2002. A total of 117 yeasts isolated from 97 patients were included in this
study. These ICU patients were hospitalized for a mean of 29 days. All yeasts
were identified by conventional methods and using the API (20C AUX, ID 32C)
system (Bio Meriéux, France). Susceptibility to fluconazole and amphotericin B
was evaluated using the E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The most commonly
isolated yeast was Candida albicans (72.6%), followed by Candida tropicalis
(16.2%), Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Trichosporon
mucoides and Geotrichum spp. Fluconazole and amphotericin B MIC90 values were
0.75 microg/ml; 0.19 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml; 0.38 microg/ml for C. albicans
and C. tropicalis, respectively. All Geotrichum spp. were found to be
susceptible-dose dependent (SDD) (MIC=16-32 microg/ml) to fluconazole. Two C.
albicans, two C. tropicalis, one C. krusei and one Geotrichum spp. had a MIC
value of > or = 0.38 microg/ml for amphotericin B. The rate of colonization was
3.36% (47/1397). Only 10 (0.71%) patients out of a total of 1397 developed
candidemia during the period of the investigation. Of these, 7 (70%) were caused 
by non-albicans Candida spp.

Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.

Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) was evaluated for its ability to enhance the
antibody response to diphtheria toxin and its fragment A and fragment B subunits.
BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with 1 Lf of diphtheria toxoid in the
presence of 25 microg of MPL on days 0 and 14. Two weeks after the second
immunization, sera were obtained from the mice and analysed for antibody response
to diphtheria toxin and its subunits. A new ELISA method, developed in our
laboratory, was used to measure antibody levels against the toxin, fragment A,
and fragment B. It was observed that MPL significantly enhanced antibody
responses to diphtheria toxin and its subunits. However, there was no statistical
difference between anti-A and anti-B responses. The results indicated that MPL
seems to be a potential candidate as an adjuvant for future diphtheria vaccine
formulation.

Cystic nephroma (CN) and pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) are rare tumors. In the
cases presented here, a 13-month-old boy underwent right radical nephrectomy for 
CN. From the family history we learned that four years ago the patient's older
sister underwent left radical nephrectomy for CN at a different center when she
was 4 years old. A lung tumor was detected in the sister one year after
nephrectomy. Biopsy from the lung tumor revealed PPB, and the sister died within 
one year after biopsy. To the knowledge of the authors, these cases represent the
second reported familial occurrence of CN and the fourth of CN and PPB.

Primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the breast is a rare pathology, and bilateral
involvement is exceptional. We report a case of bilateral primary non-Hodgkin
lymphoma of the breast in a 40-year-old woman. Predominantly atypical lymphocytes
and rare plasma cells were found in the microscopic evaluation of the fine-needle
aspiration biopsy of the right and left breasts. Microscopic findings of the
incisional biopsy of the left breast were in accordance with non-Hodgkin diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma. The patient received systemic chemotherapy and is alive
with no evidence of recurrence for 2 years.

Oropharyngeal chordoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration: a case report.

Köybaşioğlu F(1), Simşek GG, Onal BU, Han U, Adabağ A.

Author information: 
(1)Cytology Unit, Department of Pathology, Social Security Foundation Training
Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Due to its rarity, chordoma may be difficult to differentiate from
other neoplasms with a similiar myxoid background. We describe a case of chordoma
involving the oropharynx inferiorly that was diagnosed by transoral fine needle
aspiration (FNA) cytology (FNAC) and confirmed by histologic studies. This
appears to be 1 of the few reported applications of FNA in the diagnosis of
chordoma of the oropharynx in the English-language literature.
CASE: A 50-year-old male presented with nocturnal dyspnea and rare hemoptysis for
6 months. A hypodense mass was located in the left posterior side of the
oropharynx. FNAC of the mass showed classic physaliferous cells with a bubbly
appearance and myxoid fibrillary background. The aspirate was reported as "myxoid
tumor suggestive of chordoma," as confirmed by histopathologic investigation of
the excisional biopsy.
CONCLUSION: The cytologic features of chordoma are quite characteristic,
especially on May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG)-stained slides. The cytoplasmic vacuoles 
of the physaliferous cells and the mucoid matrix of the tumor become conspicuous 
on MGG staining. When Papanicolaou staining is used as the only staining
procedure, the cytoplasmic vacuoles of the physaliferous cells and mucoid matrix 
of chordomas may be overlooked. The differential diagnosis of myxoid tumors is of
utmost importance for therapy and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration cytology
(FNAC) in ovarian lesions.
STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-two fine needle aspirations of varied ovarian masses were
performed between January 2000 and February 2003. Aspiration material was
obtained from fresh tissues at the time of frozen section before dissection of
the specimens. The slides were evaluated by a pathologist who was blinded to the 
gross findings and histopathologic diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 62.9% of cases were assessed as malignant and 30.6% as
benign. Two false positive and 2 false negative cases occurred. In our series the
overall sensitivity and specificity were 95.1% and 90.4%, respectively. Seven
benign and 15 malignant lesions could be subclassified specifically.
CONCLUSION: We studied excised specimens, but since ovarian masses are reachable 
by laparoscopically and ultrasonographically guided aspiration, FNAC can be used 
for diagnoses of these lesions. If a multidisciplinary approach can be carried
out in patients with ovarian lesions, cytopathologic interpretation can provide
optimum benefits.

Interdigitating dendritic cell tumor with breast and cervical lymph-node
involvement: a case report and review of the literature.

Interdigitating dendritic cell tumor (IDCT) is an extremely rare malignancy. It
occurs primarily in lymph nodes, but extranodal involvement has also been
reported. A 38-year-old woman with IDCT with breast and cervical lymph-node
involvement is reported in this paper. To our knowledge, this is the first case
of IDCT originating from the breast. In the breast and lymph node, the tumor
displayed diffuse sheets, fascicles and storiform growth pattern. It was composed
of oval to spindle cells with pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm, ill-defined cell
outlines, oval nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent eosinophilic
nucleoli. Mitotic activity was three per ten high-power fields. The neoplastic
cells were intermingled with small mature lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor cells were strongly and
diffusely positive for vimentin, CD68, S-100 protein, CD45/leukocyte common
antigen and fascin and focally positive for lysozyme, alpha-1 antitrypsin and
CD4. Ki-67 labeling index was 10%. The patient was treated with combined
therapeutic approaches, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. IDCT
has the potential for an aggressive clinical course. However, 32 months after the
initial diagnosis, the patient is still alive and being followed with a stable
tumor burden.

Cerebral fat embolism: pulmonary contusion is a more important etiology than long
bone fractures.

Lipid embolism is a serious and life-threatening problem and usually arises as a 
complication of severe trauma associated with long bone or pelvic fractures. It
is generally thought that fat droplets enter the circulation at the site of
fracture. In the systemic circulation, they become emboli to brain, kidney and
other areas. Lipids are absorbed from the intestinal tract and transported into
pulmonary tissue via thoracic duct and exposed to first catabolic procedures in
the lungs. We have predicted that systemic lipid embolism may not occur unless
bone fractures lead to pulmonary injury. This study was planned to investigate
this hypothesis with respect to the role of pulmonary contusion and long bone
fractures in the formation of cerebral fat embolism. Twenty male hybrid rabbits
were included in this study. Pulmonary contusion was performed on half of the
rabbits (n = 10) and femur fracture was applied to the remaining ones (n = 10).
Ten days after procedure, all rabbits were sacrificed. Brain specimens were taken
by frozen-section method and stained with Sudan black. Intraarteriolar lipid
particles in the brain were examined microscopically. Cerebral fat embolism was
detected in seven animals exposed to pulmonary contusion and only in one animal
exposed to femur fracture. The mean number of branches of middle cerebral artery 
at midparietal level occluded with fat particles were higher in the pulmonary
contusion group than in the long bone fracture group. In conclusion, we found
that pulmonary contusion had more deleterious effects than long bone fracture in 
the formation of cerebral fat embolism.

Spinal neurenteric cysts are rare congenital lesions of endodermal origin that
lead to spinal cord compression or tethering. These cysts are usually lined by
mucus-secreting epithelium resembling that of the gastrointestinal tract. A
31-year-old man presented with low back and bilateral limb pain of three-year
duration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intradural extramedullary 
heterogeneous mass lesion at L4 - L5 disc level causing severe compression and
displacement of terminal portion of conus medullaris to the left side.
Additionally, tethered cord, syringohydromyelia and spina bifida were present. He
had also polysyndactyly on the left foot. The patient underwent laminoplasty and 
partial excision of the lesion through a posterior approach. Neurosurgical
exploration revealed a large intradural, extramedullary solid lesion with cystic 
component, compressing the spinal cord. Histopathology confirmed a neurenteric
cyst with mucin-producing cuboidal or columnar epithelium lining the cystic
cavity. Clinical suspicion is important for an early diagnosis, and their early
preplanned surgical removal should be the goal of treatment, which leads to a
better outcome. This case is reported in view of rare congenital abnormality in
an adult with peculiar presentation.

BACKGROUND: Regulation of nucleolus organizer region (NOR) expression in trisomy 
21 (Down syndrome [DS]) cells is not fully explained. This work compared NOR
expression on metaphase chromosomes in gradiently stimulated lymphocytes from DS 
patients with those from healthy controls.
METHOD: Conventional peripheral blood culture (72 h) and chromosomal preparation 
procedures were used except that blood samples from each individual were
cultivated in the same but gradiently increasing concentrations (0.37, 0.75,
1.48, and 2.21 ml) of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) per 100 ml of medium. One hundred 
consecutive metaphases per concentration were analyzed for scoring the means of
the active NORs bearing chromosomes (AgNOR+ chromosome) per individual and per
concentration.
RESULTS: In contrast to healthy controls (n=24), AgNOR+ chromosomal number in
lymphocytes from 30 DS patients increased in concordance to the gradient of PHA
concentration in the culture medium.
CONCLUSION: DS lymphocytes do not downregulate their NOR expression in the limit 
of control cells. This in vitro result may serve as a clue for the explanation of
the DS phenotype due to the wasted energy in producing unnecessary rRNA
transcripts and AgNOR proteins in utero during organogenesis. These results also 
indicate that precautions must be used in routine work of NOR
evaluation/interpretation in DS lymphocytes.

To evaluate the role of c-jun and c-myc proto-oncogenes in normal, hyperplastic
and neoplastic endometrium in relation to estrogen receptor (ER) status and to
investigate whether these genes can be related to other histopathological
features of endometrial carcinoma, 32 endometrial carcinomas, 38 endometrial
hyperplasias and 22 cyclic endometria (10 proliferative and 12 secretory) were
evaluated histologically. Endometrial hyperplasia cases were classified as simple
and complex hyperplasia without atypia, and atypical hyperplasia. Endometrial
carcinoma cases were subtyped according to the International Society of
Gynecological Pathologists. Modified FIGO system was used for both grading and
staging. Immunohistochemical examination was performed using antibodies to
ER-alpha, c-myc and c-jun with streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. The mean
percentage of ER-alpha positive cells changed cyclically during the menstrual
cycle, and it was the highest (96%) and the lowest (31.6%) in proliferative and
carcinomatous endometrium, respectively. There was a statistically significant
difference between proliferative and secretory phases and proliferative and
carcinomatous endometrium in relation to ER-alpha staining (p<0.05). There was
also a statistically significant difference with respect to ERalpha reactivity
between secretory phase and each hyperplastic group, as well as between the
carcinoma group and each hyperplastic group (p<0.05). Although not significant,
the mean percentage of c-myc expressing cells in the carcinoma group was higher
(15.3%) than that of proliferative phase and hyperplastic groups. The mean
percentage of c-jun positive cells in proliferative endometrium was slightly
higher than in secretory endometrium, and it was the highest in atypical
hyperplastic endometrium (28.3%), but there was no statistically significant
difference between the groups. In carcinoma cases, a positive correlation was
observed between c-jun positivity and tumor grade (p=0.027, r=0.3908), but such a
correlation with c-myc was not found. A positive correlation was detected between
ER-alpha and c-myc expression (p=0.038, r=0.3686). A progressive loss of ER seems
to be correlated with increasing malignant transformation. C-myc expression might
play a role in the development of endometrial carcinoma via ER. The association
between c-jun and ER appears to be lost in endometrial carcinoma. The
relationship between c-myc, c-jun and ER appears to be altered in endometrial
carcinoma compared to that of menstrual endometrium.

Inherited polymorphisms in the genes controlling the cell cycle or functioning in
the DNA repair mechanisms may impair their function and contribute to genetic
susceptibility. Abnormalities in the DNA repair have been reported in head and
neck cancer. The XRCC1 gene functions in singlestrand break and base excision
repair processes. In this study, two polymorphisms of the XRCC1 gene, Arg194Trp
and Arg399Gln were investigated in 95 patients with head and neck carcinoma. The 
polymorphic regions were amplified by PCR followed by digestion with
methylation-specific restriction enzymes, and analyzed electrophoretically.
Genotype and allele frequencies were calculated, and association with cancer risk
or clinical parameters was investigated. No association was observed between the 
genotypes and head and neck cancer for either polymorphism. Distribution of the
alleles did not significantly differ between the patients and the control group. 
A significant association was only found for the Trp194 allele among the smoking 
individuals. Our data indicate that the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms do 
not confer a significant risk for head and neck carcinogenesis.

The complement system is part of the host defence response. However, considerable
evidence suggests that complement plays an important role in the pathophysiology 
of ischemic heart disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate complement
activation in patients with all forms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and to
examine the relationship between the degree of complement activation and
myocardial injury. The study population included 152 subjects (26 females): 82
with ACS (35 acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 22 non-Q wave MI (NQMI), 25
unstable angina (UAP)) (Group A), 35 stable angina (SA) (Group B), and 35 healty 
control subjects (Group C). Complement 3 (C3), Complement 4 (C4), C-reactive
protein (CRP), troponin I (TnI) as well as creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) were
evaluated. Patients' blood samples were taken on admission (day 1) and after 2, 3
and 7 days in group A. However, only one measurement was performed in the groups 
B and C. Plasma C3 and C4 peak levels were significantly higher in patients with 
AMI (141+/-29 and 35+/-11 mg/dl) and NQMI (136+/-13 and 35+/-7 mg/dl) than in
patients with SA (128+/-14 and 27+/-10 mg/dl) and the control subjects (114+/-22 
and 22+/-7 mg/dl) (p<0.03). Also, C3 and C4 serum levels in patients with SA and 
UAP (126+/-16 and 31+/-7 mg/dl) were significantly higher than those in control
subjects (p<0.01, p<0.03, respectively). At 1-week follow-up, there were no
significant differences between the plasma levels of C3 and C4 in patients with
UAP (p>0.05). However, plasma levels of C3 and C4 were significantly different
between days in patients with AMI and NQMI (p<0.0001). Plasma C3 and C4 levels in
ACS showed a relationship with peak CK-MB and Tn I levels (p<0.01). Plasma CRP
level in ACS showed positive correlation with C3 (p<0.01) and C4 (p<0.001). In
this study, we determined that plasma C3 and C4 levels were elevated in ACS and
SA. Although C3 and C4 were higher in ACS and SA, the systemic levels of
inflammatory markers in patients with SA and UAP were lower than those found in
the AMI and NQMI groups. The relationship between C3, C4 levels and ACS further
suggests that the complement activation is related to necrosis within the
myocardium.

Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder
characterized by splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and circulating atypical lymphocytes
with circumferential cytoplasmic projections. We investigated the specificity and
the sensitivity of anti-TRAP antibody immunoreactivity in 57 cases of HCL. We
found that there is a statistically highly significant difference between TRAP
immunoreactivities of the study and the control groups, and HCL can be diagnosed 
by TRAP immunoreactivity in bone marrow trephine biopsy materials with a
specificity of 98.27 % and a sensitivity of 100%.

Contribution of morphometry in the differential diagnosis of fine-needle thyroid 
aspirates.

(1)Department of Pathology, Gülhane Military Medical Academy and Medical Faculty,
Ankara, Turkey. ykarslioglu@superonline.com

BACKGROUND: Cytologic discrimination of cellular nodules, follicular adenoma, and
follicular carcinoma in the thyroid is problematic. Methods are needed to achieve
a reliable diagnosis. Some sophisticated tools, such as microarrays, offer great 
potential but lack accompanying morphologic information.
METHODS: One hundred twelve samples obtained from patients with lesions
histopathologically diagnosed as nodular goiter, follicular adenoma, follicular
carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma were used. Eight geometric features, such as
nuclear area and circular form factor, were measured. The dataset was divided
into six overlapping groups to represent the frequently encountered situations in
routine practice. Multivariate analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant
differences test, and discriminant analysis were performed. Statistical analysis 
was carried out with two conceptually different approaches. In the first, data
from all measured nuclei were used. In the second, a subset of data representing 
the most extreme values of variables was extracted from the entire dataset to
simulate the "selection procedure" performed during conventional morphologic
examination.
RESULTS: When the selected dataset instead of data from all measured nuclei was
used, the correct classification rates in discriminant analysis improved
considerably.
CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic examination is based primarily on selection. Using data 
obtained from all of the cells in morphometry may cause a dilution effect in
diagnostically important features. Morphometric studies may also be planned with 
a proper selection "bias." This may be particularly helpful when isolated
abnormal cells carry most of the diagnostic information.

Secretory breast carcinoma is a rare entity. It was first reported in pediatric
patients in 1966, and was named juvenile breast carcinoma. Incidences of
pediatric and adult patients are similar. Prognosis is favorable in both groups, 
but distant metastases have been reported. The authors describe a case of
secretory breast carcinoma with extensive intraductal component.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a "slow" bacterial pathogen, which induces
several gastroduodenal diseases. Varying degrees of inflammation can be present
in the gastric mucosa of patients infected with H. pylori. The case presented
here is a male patient suffering from dyspepsia and nausea. His upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed pan gastritis. Histological examination of
multiple gastric biopsies taken from the body and antrum showed a rare
morphological expression of H. pylori gastritis characterized by diffuse plasma
cell infiltration with extensive Russell body formation. Diffuse infiltration of 
plasma cells with Russell bodies in gastric mucosa can cause difficulties in
differentiation from neoplastic processes. However, immunohistochemically, the
infiltrating cells in the gastric mucosa stained negatively with cytokeratins
while they expressed both kappa and lambda light chains showing their polyclonal 
nature. The presence of diffuse plasma cells with Russell bodies in the gastric
mucosa may represent a different presentation of H. pylori gastritis. There are
only two case reports of similar presentation and both have been called "Russell 
body gastritis".

The health personnel working in the autopsy rooms and laboratories are considered
among the professional groups carrying a high risk of contamination with
infection. In this study, we have investigated the prevalence of Demodex, which
provides a convenient environment for bacteria and acts as a vector for certain
microorganisms, in the health personnel working in autopsy rooms. The study,
which was cross-sectional, was conducted on 58 health personnel working in
autopsy rooms. A questionnaire was administered to the individuals. Specimens
were obtained from 4 different regions of the face using the standard
skin-surface biopsy technique. The data obtained were then evaluated
statistically. This study group consisted of 76% males and 24% females. The
prevalence of Demodex was 26%. Demodex was found to occur more frequently in
women. The most frequent occurrence of Demodex was seen among people with darker 
complexion and in cheek localizations. We believe that Demodex, which has a role 
in the pathogenesis of dermatologic diseases, provides a convenient environment
for bacteria, and acts as a vector for some pathogenic microorganisms, poses a
risk as far as individuals working in the autopsy room are concerned.

fyeren@superonline.com

A 48-year-old woman with a 14 cm left ovarian mass had total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. On cut section the tumor had a 
solid and a cystic component. There was a 2.5 cm nodule attached to the cyst
wall. Sections taken from the solid component revealed a tumor composed of
interlacing bundles of fusiform cells, resembling a leiomyoma. Smooth muscle
actin positivity confirmed the diagnosis. Sections taken from the nodule in the
cystic part revealed an adenofibroma. There was an SMA positive area in the cyst 
wall which we think is the possible origin of the leiomyoma. As far as we know,
this is the first case of a co-existing leiomyoma and serous cystadenofibroma in 
the ovary, and we think it will broaden the histological spectrum of primary
ovarian leiomyomas.

Role of fine needle aspiration cytology in the preoperative presumptive diagnosis
of ameloblastoma.

Uçok O(1), Doğan N, Uçok C, Günhan O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oral Diagnosis and Radiology, Gülhane Military Medical Academy, 
Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) on the
preoperative presumptive diagnosis of ameloblastoma.
STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-three patients, diagnosed preoperatively and postoperatively 
with ameloblastoma, were evaluated between 1990 and 2003. The patients were
classified according to whether they were diagnosed with ameloblastoma
preoperatively or postoperatively, on histologic examination.
RESULTS: The accuracy rate for ameloblastoma was 0.95% for all biopsy methods,
while the incisional biopsy rate was 75.00%. Concerning clinical diagnosis,
ameloblastoma was mistaken mostly (56.41%) for odontogenic cysts (22 of 39).
CONCLUSION: FNAC should be utilized more commonly on intraosseous and soft tissue
lesions in the oral and maxillofacial regions, to obtain sufficient material. It 
is convenient, inexpensive and noninvasive as compared with other biopsy methods.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between corneoconjunctival calcification 
and conjunctival squamous metaplasia in patients with chronic renal failure
(CRP).
STUDY DESIGN: We studied impression cytology in 45 CRF patients on regular
hemodialysis and 30 age- and sex-matched controls. Specimens were obtainedfrom
the temporal bulbar conjunctiva using cellulose acetate filter paper. The samples
were fixed in a mixture of 70% ethyl alcohol, 37% formaldehyde and glacial acetic
acid and then stained with a combination of periodic acid- Schiff and Gill's
modified Papanicolaou stain and graded by a masked observer. Corneoconjunctival
calcification was graded by the Porter-Crombie classification.
RESULTS: Of 45 study patients, 4 (9%) disclosed grade 0, 23 (51%) grade 1, 14
(31%) grade 2 and 4 grade 3 (9%) impression cytology changes. There was a
statistically significant difference between the patient and control groups (p < 
0.001). Calcium deposits were more frequent and extensive in CRF patients than in
controls (p = 0.01). There was no correlation between impression cytology and
calcium deposit grades (p = 0.128). However the presence of conjunctival
inflammation correlated with the existence of extensive squamous metaplasia (p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: The severity of conjunctival changes in CRF patients on regular
hemodialysis are not related to calcium deposition but to acute conjunctival
inflammation.

In this study, a survey was conducted to investigate the possible effects of long
term usage of mobile phone (MP) on eyes. The studied symptoms are blurring of
vision, redness on the eyes, vision disturbance, secretion of the eyes,
inflammation in the eyes and lacrimation of the eyes. There is no effect on
redness on the eyes and vision disturbance, but some statistical evidences are
found that MP may cause blurring of vision, secretion of the eyes, inflammation
in the eyes and lacrimation of the eyes. These results suggest an awareness of
the symptoms and sensations.

Juvenile non-hyaline fibromatosis: juvenile hyaline fibromatosis without
prominent hyaline changes.

ranaanadolu@hotmail.com

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare autosomal recessive disease of the 
connective tissue. It is characterized by papulonodular skin lesions, soft tissue
masses, gingival hypertrophy, osteolytic bone lesions and flexion contractures of
the large joints. Here, we report a 14-year-old girl with characteristic clinical
features of JHF with early fatal outcome. Dermatopathologic examination of the
early lesions however constantly lacked the so-called hyalin changes in multiple 
skin biopsies. According to our experience; dermatopathological features of this 
entity is not often and always consists of classical hyalinisation. Only larger
lesions with long duration should expected to be exhibiting those features.
Therefore we suggest that; JHF may often present itself as Juvenile Non-Hyaline
Fibromatosis: JHF without prominent hyaline changes. And thus this fact should
not change the actual diagnosis and prognostic implications.

Giant axonal neuropathy in two siblings: clinical histopathological findings.

Hergüner MO(1), Zorludemir S, Altunbasak S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Neurology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine,
Adana, Turkey. oherguner@hotmail.com

OBJECTIVE: Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare, severe autosomal-recessive
neurologic disease affecting both the peripheral and the central nervous system. 
In this article, we describe a detailed clinicopathological report of two
affected sibs from a consanguineous Turkish family.
PATIENTS: The index patient was a 6.5-year-old girl. Her intellectual development
was normal. At the age of 3, her parents noticed progressive lack of balance and 
deterioration of motor skills. On examination, she had paresis and sensory loss
more marked distally. Her mental status was normal. Her older brother had similar
findings.
RESULTS: Electrophysiological studies of young patients showed decreased median
and ulnar nerve conduction velocities, absent peroneal motor potential, absent
sensory nerve potentials and an EMG suggesting a neurogenic pattern. MRI showed
mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. The nerve biopsy showed moderate myelinated
nerve fibres loss, several regenerative clusters and multiple giant axons. Focal 
demyelination, hypertrophic "onion pulp" changes and endoneural fibrosis were
also seen. Immunohistochemically, neurofilament protein accumulation was
detectable in giant axons.
CONCLUSIONS: This consanguineous family with two affected siblings and healthy
parents complies with autosomal-recessive inheritance in GAN. In the majority of 
reported GAN cases, CNS involvement is described early in the course of the
disease, but these patients did not present any sign of CNS involvement. GAN is a
rare genetic disease of childhood involving the central and peripheral nervous
systems. The diagnosis is easy with clinical, electrophysiological, and
histopathological features, if it has been done. Early diagnosis is important,
because of possible prenatal diagnosis.

Author information: 
(1)The Council of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpaşa, 34300, Istanbul, Turkey.

Paternity tests are carried out by the analysis of hypervariable short tandem
repeat DNA loci. These microsatellite sequences mutate at a higher rate than that
of bulk DNA. The occurrence of germline mutations at STR loci posses problems in 
interpretation of resulting genetic profiles. We recently analyzed 59-159
parent/child allele transfers at 13 microsatellite loci. We identified 12
mutations in 7 microsatellite loci. No mutations were occurred in other 6 loci.
The highest mutation rate was observed with 5 mutations at D8S1179 locus at
different alleles. The event was always single repeat related. The mutation rate 
was between 0 and 1.5 x 10(-2) per locus per gamete per generation. The mutation 
event is very crucial for forensic DNA testing and accumulation of STR mutation
data is extremely important for genetic profile interpretation.

The frequency and the distribution of HLA-B27 subtypes in spondylarthropathy
(SpA) patients and controls were investigated in a sample Turkish population. B27
subtyping was performed by PCR-SSP method in two groups: 49 unrelated HLA-B27
positive Turkish patients with the diagnosis of SpA according to the European
Spondyloarthropathy Study Group Criteria, and 55 HLA-B27 positive healthy
controls. The frequency of HLA-B*27 was 2.6% in the Turkish population, and
B*2705 was the predominant allele among patients with SpA. The difference was
mainly between male patients and male controls The proportion of B*2705 among
B27-positive patients and controls was significantly different (P=0.02). Our
study supports other reports from different populations which showed that B*2705 
and B*2702 were more frequent in Caucasian patients with SpA.

Coexistence of lactating adenoma and invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast
in a pregnant woman.

Saglam A(1), Can B.

Author information:

A 36 year old pregnant woman was admitted to hospital complaining of an enlarging
mass in her left breast. Histopathological examination of the mastectomy specimen
revealed a high grade infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma intermixed with a
lactating adenoma. Lactating adenomas are rare entities but are the most common
masses that occur during pregnancy. Although they are not thought to carry an
increased risk of cancer there are two other case reports in the literature of a 
lactating adenoma associated with an infiltrating carcinoma. In this case, areas 
where the lactating adenoma and the infiltrating carcinoma were intermixed could 
be identified. This case could simply be a collision tumour, although the
possibility of an invasive carcinoma arising within a lactating adenoma cannot be
ruled out. Because of the relative lack of experience with lactating adenomas,
the question of an increased association with carcinoma development remains
unclear.

(1)Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylül University School of Medicine, Inciralti,
Izmir 35340, Turkey.

AIMS: The assessment of desmoplasia by traditional semiquantitative methods does 
not provide reliable prognostic data. The aim of this study was to quantify
desmoplasia by computerised image analysis in primary colorectal carcinomas and
to investigate its ability to predict overall survival.
METHODS: In total, 112 colorectal adenocarcinomas, with a median follow up of 66 
months, were studied. The representative tumour sections were stained by the van 
Gieson method, which stains collagen rich stroma red. For quantitative
histochemical measurement, digital images were analysed by a computerised image
analysis program to calculate the percentage of red stained tissue area. The
percentage of desmoplasia (PD) was related to conventional clinicopathological
prognostic factors and overall survival.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) PD was 4.85 (3.37). PD was found to be significantly
associated with lymph vessel and venous invasion. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, PD
was associated with survival-patients with PD > 4 had a shorter survival than
those with PD </= 4. In multivariate analysis, tumour stage, distant metastasis, 
and PD emerged as independent prognostic factors.
CONCLUSION: Desmoplasia measured by image analysis seems to be a significant
prognostic indicator in patients with colorectal carcinoma and the improved
method described in this study would be useful for routine prognostication.

Turkey. nculhaci@hotmail.com

Abscess of the spleen is a very rare lesion. In this study, 4 cases of splenic
abscess are presented and discussed along with the literature. The cases were
between 16 and 55 years-old and two of them had hematologic malignancy. All of
them had been operated on because of acute abdomen, and in two cases splenic
rupture was present. Only in one of the cases was salmonellosis detected by
microbiological methods. By histological examination, expansion and congestion in
splenic sinusoids, and foci of abscess including wide areas of necrosis and
inflammatory infiltration by neutrophils were seen in all cases. The most
frequent cause of splenic abscess is septic embolism arising from bacterial
endocarditis. There are also a few splenic abscess cases seen with malignancies. 
While splenic abscess is seen rarely, it has a high rate of mortality when it is 
diagnosed late.

Primary lung adenocarcinomas and metastatic adenocarcinomas may show a great
morphologic resemblance to malignant mesothelioma. There are numerous
immunohistochemical markers being used, but none of them were proved to be
effective enough to reach a certain diagnosis. The current study was performed to
evaluate the utility of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and surfactant
protein-B (SP-B) expression in the differential diagnosis between lung
adenocarcinomas and pleural mesotheliomas. In this retrospective study, TTF-1 and
SP-B were applied to 30 cases with adenocarcinoma and 15 cases with pleural
mesothelioma, immunohistochemically, using an avidin-biotin detection system.
Twenty percent of adenocarcinomas and 13.3% of pleural mesothelioma stained
positive for SP-B. TTF-1 stained 24 of the 30 adenocarcinomas (80%) and none of
the 15 mesotheliomas (0%). TTF-1 positivity in adenocarcinomas was found to be
statistically significant, while SP-B had no important practical value either
used alone or in combination with TTF-1. There was no statistically significant
correlation between the differentiation level of adenocarcinomas and TTF-1
staining pattern. In conclusion, we believe that TTF-1 may be helpful in
distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma from pleural mesothelioma.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of azithromycin on 
mucocutaneous manifestations, oral health and immune response in Behçet's disease
(BD).
METHODS: Eight BD patients with active mucocutaneous symptoms were treated with
azithromycin for 4 weeks. Oral health, clinical manifestations and in vitro
interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-10 and monocyte chemotactic
protein (MCP)-1 responses were evaluated before and after treatment.
RESULTS: The number of folliculitic lesions, healing time of oral ulcers and
scores of plaque indexes (PLIs) were lower after azithromycin treatment (P<0.05).
Scores of PLIs correlated positively with the healing time of oral ulcers
(P=0.02). Although a trend towards increased stimulated IL-10 responses with
azithromycin was observed, no statistically significant difference was found.
Stimulated and unstimulated MCP-1, IFN-gamma and IL-12 responses were similar
before and after treatment (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Azithromycin was observed to be effective in decreasing folliculitic 
lesions and fastening the healing time of oral ulcers in BD.

The levels of plasma and salivary antioxidants in the patient with recurrent
aphthous stomatitis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Turgut Ozal 
Medical Center, Malatya, Turkey. ykarincaoglu@inonu.edu.tr

BACKGROUND: Despite plenty of research, the cause of recurrent aphthous
stomatitis (RAS) remains obscure. It has been proposed that, the aetiological
factors such as local trauma, smoking, vitamin deficiencies and viral infections 
lead to aphthae formation via final common pathway based on increased oxidative
stress. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antioxidant enzyme
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx)
alterations in plasma and saliva, and in addition uric acid (UA) in saliva, in
patients with RAS and healthy controls.
METHODS: Thirty-two patients with RAS and 30 healthy controls were included into 
the study. The SOD, CAT, GSHPx and UA levels were measured in plasma and saliva
in study and control groups.
RESULTS: In the RAS group, although the mean SOD (P<0.001) and CAT (P<0.05)
levels of plasma were lower, GSHPx (P<0.001) levels were higher than control
group. The salivary concentrations of the SOD (P<0.001), CAT (P<0.05) and GSHPx
(P<0.001) in RAS group were entirely opposite to plasma concentrations. UA were
not significant between RAS group and controls.
CONCLUSION: Since we found salivary SOD and CAT levels were high whereas plasma
levels were low, it has been thought that, salivary defence mechanisms via
antioxidant agents may be stimulated against to the ulcerous lesion. We consider 
that the organism might mobilize the antioxidant potential to the sites where
they were needed. At this point, decrease of SOD and CAT levels in the plasma may
be related to this shift. It is also thought that GSHPx secretion in the saliva
may also be increased but the increase in its turnover may be responsible for the
diminished activity.

Effects of selenium on histopathological and enzymatic changes in experimental
liver injury of rats.

Ozardali I(1), Bitiren M, Karakilçik AZ, Zerin M, Aksoy N, Musa D.

Author information:

The most important antioxidant aspect of selenium is its function in the active
site of selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione peroxidase not only
allows the removal of the toxic radicals but also permits the regeneration of
lipid molecules through reacylation in the cellular membrane. Thus, GSHPx may
prevent the harmful effects of free radicals and may reduce the formation of the 
reactive metabolites of carbon tetrachloride. Carbon tetrachloride is a
hepatotoxic agent which generates haloalkane radicals during its
biotransformation in the liver and is widely used to make the experimental model 
of hepatic damage. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the 
possible protective role of selenium on the experimental liver cirrhosis and some
enzyme activities in blood plasma from rats. While the activities of aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) were significantly increased (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01,
respectively), gamma-glutamyle transferase (GGT) activity was not statistically
affected (p < 0.05) with carbon tetrachloride-injection. The levels of AST, ALT
and GGT in carbon tetrachloride-group decreased to nearly the enzyme values in
control-group after the selenium-injection but the ALP was increased (p<0.01). On
the other hand, it was noticed that selenium significantly decreased the hepatic 
injury. In conclusion, our results showed that carbon tetrachloride caused an
increase in the activities of liver enzymes in plasma and selenium application
decreased the hepatic injury. Plasma levels of the liver enzymes were decreased
after selenium-injections. Based upon these results, selenium may play an
important role in the preventive indication of hepatic cellular injury inducted
by carbon tetrachloride.

Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML), also known as
Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), is an idiopathic histiocytic proliferation affecting
lymph nodes. It is typically characterized by painless cervical lymphadenopathy, 
fever and weight loss. Although extranodal involvement has been reported in
diverse sites, intracranial presentation, particularly in the absence of nodal
disease is uncommon. To the best of our knowledge, 48 patients with intracranial 
masses have been reported previously. A 31-year-old man was admitted to our
clinic with a 4-month history of progressive headache. His medical history was
unremarkable except for occasional fever. There were not any neurological deficit
and weight loss. No lymphadenopathy (particularly bilateral cervical) and
extranodal involvement in diverse sites were revealed by physical and
radiological examinations. Routine hematological and biochemical studies were
normal except for mild leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing that revealed an
enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe. Preoperative diagnosis was meningioma. 
The patient underwent a left frontotemporal craniotomy with complete resection of
the mass. Histopathology was compatible with RDD. Extranodal RDD is rarely found 
intracranially. Prognosis is benign especially in the absence of nodal disease.
It is clinically and radiologically difficult to distinguish from meningioma, and
histological examination is essential for a definitive diagnosis.

Sialometaplasia, squamous metaplasia of salivary gland lobules, is a benign
condition occasionally presenting with lesions clinically simulating malignancy. 
"Necrotising sialometaplasia", recognised by lobular infarction, necrosis, and
simultaneous squamous metaplasia of ducts and acini is a well known condition.
There are only a few reports of the "proliferative type of sialometaplasia",
which is recognised by a more mature morphology of larger and more irregular
metaplastic nests, lacking necrosis. This report describes a unique case of
"proliferative sialometaplasia of multiple intraparotid lymph nodes" occurring in
a 55 year old woman, presenting with multiple parotid lumps. This interesting
case points to the importance of intraparotid lymph nodes as sites for multiple
lesions of the parotid region.

Recent evidence supports a critical role of neurotrophins in the regulation of
both neuronal survival and synaptic transmission during epileptogenesis. We have 
examined the immunohistochemical expression of high- (tyrosine kinase receptors, 
trk) and low-affinity (p75) neurotrophin receptors (NTRs) in the hippocampal
specimens from 18 patients with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy [TLE; 14 patients 
with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and four with focal lesions (tumours) not
involving the hippocampus proper]. Nonepileptic autopsy brains (n = 6) and
surgical specimens from tumour patients without epilepsy (n = 3) were used as
controls. Immunoreactivity (IR) for the trk receptors (trkA, trkB, trkC) was
detected in normal human brain within the pyramidal neurones of hippocampal
cornus ammoni (CA) regions and in the dentate gyrus. There were no detectable
differences in the neuronal trk IR patterns in the hippocampus between control
and TLE cases with HS, except for a decrease in neuronal density in regions where
cell death had occurred (CA1, CA3 and CA4). In contrast, a consistent increase in
trkA IR was observed in reactive astrocytes in CA1 and dentate gyrus. The
low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) was expressed in low levels in 
postnatal normal hippocampus. In contrast, neuronal p75(NTR) IR was detected in
10/14 cases of HS in spared neurones within the CA and hilar regions of the
hippocampus. Double labelling revealed that p75(NTR)-positive neurones also
contain trk receptor IR. In six cases with prominent glial activation strong
p75(NTR) IR was observed in microglial cells within the sclerotic hippocampus.
The present results indicate that changes in NTR expression are still detectable 
in the hippocampus of patients with chronic TLE and involve both glial and
neuronal cells. Reactive astrocytes were immunoreactive for trkA, whereas
activated microglia cells were reactive for p75(NTR), suggesting different
functions for specific NTRs in the development of reactive gliosis. Moreover, the
increased expression of p75(NTR) in hippocampal neurones of TLE patients may
critically influence the neuronal survival during the epileptogenic process.

Hypercholesterolemia impairs angiogenesis in patients with breast carcinoma and, 
therefore, lowers the risk of metastases.

Comment in
    Am J Clin Pathol. 2004 Nov;122(5):675-7.

Our aim was to study the effect of hypercholesterolemia on angiogenesis induced
by breast carcinoma. Of 51 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, 28 had
hypercholesterolemia and 23 had normocholesterolemia. The intratumoral
microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated by using anti-CD31 antibody. The
expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) on endothelial and tumor cells was examined and graded
semiquantitatively. Patients with normocholesterolemia had a higher MVD (76.4 +/-
8.2) than those with hypercholesterolemia (54.6 +/- 5.1) (P < .01). The risks of 
recurrence and distant metastasis were higher in patients with
normocholesterolemia than in patients with hypercholesterolemia (P < .01).
Patients with hypercholesterolemia showed lower expression of endothelial VEGF
and bFGF than patients with normocholesterolemia (P < .05 and P < .01,
respectively). In addition, tumoral bFGF and VEGF expression showed negative
correlation with the presence of hypercholesterolemia (P < .01). We suggest that 
hypercholesterolemia impairs angiogenesis by suppressing endothelial and tumoral 
bFGF and VEGF expression and, therefore, lowers the risk of metastases in cases
of invasive breast carcinoma.

Turkey. ozlemo@baskent-ank.edu.tr

Chordoid meningioma is a rare variant of meningioma that bears a striking
histological resemblance to chordoma and has greater likelihood of recurrence.
Although most meningiomas occur in the intracranial, orbital and intravertebral
cavities, rare meningiomas have been reported in extracranial organs; thus, it is
important to be able to distinguish them from other neoplasms that have similar
histology but different biological behavior and therapies. A case of chordoid
meningioma in a 48-year-old woman who did not have Castleman's syndrome is
described in the present report. The patient presented with a mass in her left
frontoparietal region, and had been suffering from headaches for many years.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated an expansive lytic lesion in
the squamous portion of the left temporal bone. The lesion extended in both
directions. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a tumor
composed of cords and nests of eosinophilic vacuolated cells embedded in a myxoid
matrix. A typical meningiomatous pattern was observed focally, and positive
staining of the tumor cells for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen
confirmed the diagnosis of chordoid meningioma.

Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disease that can affect almost any
organ of the body. The clinical aspects of systemic sclerosis on the reproductive
system have been studied in large series, and an increased rate of cesarean
section has been reported. For this reason, in the present study the
histopathological features of cervical specimens of hysterectomyzed women with
systemic sclerosis were evaluated. An increased frequency of vascular and stromal
abnormalities in cervical specimens of women with systemic sclerosis were
observed. Vascular medial hypertrophy, intimal thickening, and fibrosis were more
often encountered in the cervical specimens of the patients with systemic
sclerosis. Some of the histopathological features also showed correlation with
the clinical profile of the disease. The patients with vascular medial
hypertrophy in their cervical specimens were older, had a higher Rodnan score,
and had longer duration of the disease. In contrast to vascular medial
hypertrophy, periadventitial edema was found in the cervical specimens of the
patients who were younger, had a lower Rodnan score, and had shorter duration of 
the disease. It was concluded that the problems that are seen in common obstetric
and gynecological practices in patients with systemic sclerosis may be explained 
by these tissue abnormalities.

Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon low-grade malignancy of the salivary
glands. Most cases occur in the major salivary gland, but a few cases affecting
the minor salivary gland have also been described. Although various growth
patterns have been reported in the literature, a few cases have been diagnosed as
ACC with follicular pattern. We present a rare case of ACC with follicular
pattern of the soft palate in a 60-year-old man. The occurrence of ACC in this
area is extremely rare, and its striking thyroid-like appearance may cause
confusion in the differential diagnosis.

The purpose of this study is to determine and to compare histopathologic
alterations of hernia sacs obtained from patients with inguinal hernia with those
of the peritoneal tissue from patients operated on for other abdominal disorders.
Samples were obtained from 42 pediatric patients with uni- or bilateral hernias, 
and from 30 pediatric control patients without hernia. Sections were stained with
hematoxylin-eosin, Gomori's trichrome, and Gomori's reticulin. Furthermore, they 
were immunohistochemically stained with anti-synaptophysin for the quantification
of neural structures. All the slides were examined for six parameters, including 
variations in tissue and collagen types, the presence of inflammation and
proliferation of vessels, neural plexus, and mesothelial cells. The results were 
evaluated statistically using the independent T-test and the Mann-Whitney-U test.
Parametric tests revealed a higher presence of large neural plexus (p = 0.003),
increased proliferation of mesothelial cells (p = 0.009), and
hypervascularization (p = 0.003) in sacs of the hernia group. There were also
major changes that were dependent on the sex of the patients. Most part of hernia
sacs tissue was found to be fibrous and adipose in most boy patients, but was
fibro-muscular in girls with inguinal hernia (male/female p = 0.03), while the
tissues were fibro-adipose in both sexes in the control group (inguinal
hernia/control p = 0.016). Similarly, vascular proliferation was mainly
encountered in hernia sacs of girls (p = 0.013). These features were not observed
in the control groups. Therefore, on the basis of sex, we determined whether or
not these findings could indicate the difference between the etiopathologic
mechanisms of inguinal hernias. Furthermore, we went into the question of whether
or not the comprehensive examination of hernia sacs sufficed to enlighten the
etiology of hernias.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether quantitative assessment of
cytologic anaplasia and angiogenesis may predict the clinical prognosis in
medulloblastoma and stratify the patients to avoid both undertreatment and
overtreatment. Medulloblastomas from 23 patients belonging to the Pediatric
Oncology Group were evaluated with respect to some prognostic variables,
including histologic assessment of nodularity and desmoplasia, grading of
anaplasia, measurement of nuclear size, mitotic cell count, quantification of
angiogenesis, including vascular surface density (VSD) and microvessel number
(NVES), and immunohistochemical scoring of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) expression. Univariate and multivariate analyses for prognostic indicators
for survival were performed. Univariate analysis revealed that extensive
nodularity was a significant favorable prognostic factor, whereas the presence of
anaplasia, increased nuclear size, mitotic rate, VSD, and NVES were significant
unfavorable prognostic factors. Using multivariate analysis, increased nuclear
size was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for survival.
Neither the presence of desmoplasia nor VEGF expression was significantly related
to patient survival. Although care must be taken not to overstate the importance 
of the results of this single-institution preliminary report, pathologic grading 
of medulloblastomas with respect to grading of anaplasia and quantification of
nodularity, nuclear size, and microvessel profiles may be clinically useful for
the treatment of medulloblastomas. Further validation of the independent
prognostic significance of nuclear size in stratifying patients is required.

The effect of betaine treatment on triglyceride levels and oxidative stress in
the liver of ethanol-treated guinea pigs.

We investigated the effect of betaine supplementation on ethanol induced
steatosis and alterations in prooxidant and antioxidant status in the liver of
guinea pigs. Animals were fed with normal chow or betaine containing chow (2%
w/w) for 30 days. Ethanol (3 g/kg, i.p.) was given for the last 10 days. We found
that ethanol treatment caused significant increases in plasma transaminase
activities, hepatic triglyceride and lipid peroxide levels. Significant decreases
in glutathione (GSH), alpha-tocopherol and total ascorbic acid (AA) levels were
also observed, but hepatic superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and
glutathione transferase activities remained unchanged as compared with those in
controls. Betaine treatment together with ethanol in guinea pigs is found to
decrease hepatic triglyceride, lipid peroxide levels and serum transaminase
activities and to increase GSH levels. No changes in alpha-tocopherol and total
AA levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were observed with betaine treatment 
in alcohol treated guinea pigs. In addition, histopathological assessment of
guinea pigs showed that betaine reduced the alcoholic fat accumulation in the
liver. Based on these data, betaine treatment has a restoring effect on the
alterations in triglyceride, lipid peroxide and GSH levels following ethanol
ingestion.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova
University, Balcali, Adana, Turkey. umete@mail.cu.edu.tr

This study was designed to investigate the preventive effect of melatonin on
doxorubicin's most important side effect, cardiotoxicity. Forty male albino
Wistar rats were utilized and the rats were divided into five groups: group I,
0.9% NaCl for 4 days; group II, doxorubicin 3 mg/kg/day for 4 days; group III,
2.5 % ethanol for 15 days; group IV, melatonin 6 mg/kg/day for 15 days; and group
V, a doxorubicin and melatonin combination were administered intraperitoneally.
At the end of the experiment, tissue samples obtained from the cardiac muscle of 
the left ventricle of the rats were processed for measurement of malondialdehyde 
and for electron microscopic examination. Malondialdehyde, a product of lipid
peroxidation, was found to be significantly higher in the doxorubicin group.
However, in the doxorubicin and melatonin combination group the level of
malondialdehyde was decreased statistical significant. The histological
examination revealed destruction of myofibrils, disorganization of sarcomeres,
mitochondrial degeneration and formation of giant mitochondria and lipid
accumulation in the doxorubicin group. Also, accumulation of filamentous
structures in the sarcoplasma in some of the cells, structural changes in
capillaries and an increase in collagen fibers forming bundles were observed.
When melatonin was added to the doxorubicin treatment all structural changes were
reduced. The cardiotoxic side effect of doxorubicin used as a chemotherapeutic
agent and was probably developed as a result of suppression of the antioxidant
system and lipid peroxidation. Therefore, it could be assumed that the addition
of melatonin in the treatment of doxorubicin could prevent the cardiotoxicity of 
doxorubicin.

drufukusta@superonline.com

Intramuscular lipoma (IML) is a relatively common variant of lipomas. The most
important sites for IML are the large muscles of the extremities. Spindle cell
lipoma (SCL) is a rare and distinct variant of lipoma. Most SCL arise in the
neck, shoulders or back. It has also been described in unusual sites, such as the
oral cavity, larynx, bronchus, breast, orbit and extremities. However,
localization of a SCL in an IML has not been described yet. Thus, we present the 
first SCL located in an IML, which was localized underneath the fascia and
embedded within the left sartorius muscle of a 55-year-old man. Microscopically, 
the SCL component of the tumor was sharply circumscribed by a fibrous capsule and
clearly separated from the IML in which it was localized. The collagen-forming
spindle cells of the SCL showed neither atypia nor pleomorphism. These cells
stained positive for CD34, while the mature fat tissue component of the SCL was
positive for S-100 protein and negative for CD34. Spindle cells were negative for
S-100 protein. Vimentin stained both components of the SCL, as well as the
striated muscle fibers and mature fat tissue of the IML. In conclusion, careful
morphological observation along with immunohistochemistry for CD34 and S-100
protein are essential to differentiate this rare tumor from lesions that enter
the differential diagnosis.

Heat shock proteins 60 and 70 expression of cutaneous lichen planus: comparison
with normal skin and psoriasis vulgaris.

BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are expressed by most living cells and
play fundamental roles in many biological processes. Their synthesis increases by
a variety of stresses in order to enable cellular survival. Although it is known 
that they play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses of the
skin, the role of HSPs in the pathogenesis of skin diseases has been studied in
only limited skin diseases. Lichen planus (LP) is a relatively common
papulosquamous dermatosis, and cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in 
its pathogenesis. Although an altered expression of certain HSPs was reported in 
oral LP lesions, the expression of HSPs in cutaneous lesions of LP has not been
investigated. In this immunohistochemical study, we aimed at investigating the
role of HSPs in the pathogenesis of LP by studying whether there is any
difference in HSP expression in cutaneous lesions of LP when compared to normal
skin and psoriasis vulgaris (PV).
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimen blocks from LP
patients (n = 39), patients with psoriasis (n = 20), and normal skin controls (n 
= 20) were used in the study. Antibodies to HSPs 60 and 70 were applied
immunohistochemically by using streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase
complex. An immunoreactivity intensity distribution index (IRIDI) was calculated 
to express the proportion of the immunoreactive cells as well as the staining
intensity in different layers of the epidermis.
RESULTS: The mean IRIDI scores for HSP60 expression in the basal, suprabasal, and
superficial epidermal layers of cutaneous LP were moderately higher than those of
normal skin, but not different from those of PV skin. These scores for HSP70 in
lesions of LP were moderately lower than those for normal skin in the basal
layer, but not significantly different from normal in the other two layers.
Scores for HSP70 in PV lesions were markedly lower in all three layers. In the
cells of the inflammatory infiltrates (mostly lymphocytes), HSP60 scores for LP
were moderately higher, compared to those for PV, whereas scores for HSP70 were
much lower for LP and very much lower for PV.
CONCLUSIONS: Significantly altered levels of HSP proteins were found in cutaneous
LP lesions in comparison with normal skin and psoriasis, suggesting the role of
HSPs in the pathogenesis of LP.

Benign glandular cells in posthysterectomy vaginal smears: the incidence is
higher than expected.

Author information:

In this study, we have investigated the frequency and clinical significance of
glandular cells in posthysterectomy vaginal smears. The slides of vaginal cuff
smears of 290 patients were reviewed. The glandular cells were categorized into
three groups: (1) squamous metaplastic-like cells; (2) columnar endocervical-like
cells; and (3) small round cuboidal cells. Glandular cells were found in 39 (13%)
of the 290 vaginal smears. Group 1 type cells were seen in 76% (n = 30), group 2 
type cells in 38% (n = 15) and group 3 type cells in 47% (n = 19) of the smears. 
In 19 (48%) of the smears combination of two or three groups were seen. The
presence of glandular cells showed a strong association with inflammation/repair 
as a background finding in the smears. No correlation could be found between the 
presence of atrophy and history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Apart from these
there was a prominent increase in reporting benign glandular cells after the
application of the current Bethesda 2001 reporting criteria in our laboratory. As
a result our study showed that the finding of glandular cells in posthysterectomy
vaginal smears is more frequent than expected and most of them could be related
to inflammatory and regenerative processes in the absence of a clearly identified
underlying cause.

akocak@inonu.edu.tr

Retained bullets and fragments following a civilian gunshot injury are quite
frequent in practical neurosurgery. It is usually possible to extract the foreign
body surgically, while rare cases are conservatively treated because of technical
reasons. Conservative treatment may present complications, and a rare form of
this presentation is migration of the bullet. A 20-year-old man presented with
migrating bullet from a supratentorial to opposite infratentorial area. We
consider that in the migrating bullet fragment cases, if there is no
contraindication, the most reasonable treatment is its urgent surgical removal.
This report reveals a supratentorial bullet migrating to the infratentorial
contralateral area, and related literature considering the different mechanisms
of migration is discussed.

Class I human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 is well known to be associated with
Behcet's disease in many ethnic groups. However, there has been no published
paper with respect to its association with HLA class I and class II among the
Turkish people who live in the eastern region of Turkey. Moreover, as it is known
that B51 antigen is encoded by 21 alleles, B*5101-5121, HLA-B51 allele typing was
performed, as well as HLA class I and class II genotyping of 75 patients with the
disease and the 54 individuals in the matched control group. The result shows
that the HLA-B51 frequency was significantly higher (58.66%) in the patient
group, compared to that in the control group (18.51%) (OR = 6.245). In the
subtyping of B51 alleles, 44 B51-positive patients possessed B*5101 (45.5%),
B*5108 (25%), B*5105 (9.1%) and B*5104 (4.5%). There was no significant
difference in the HLA-B51 allelic distribution between the patient group and the 
control group. However, homozygous carriers of HLA-B51 showed considerably high
risk (OR = 2.647) in the patient group, compared to that in the control group. In
the genotyping of class II HLA alleles, while HLA-DRB1*04 (45.3%) and HLA-DRB1*07
(24%) were the predominant alleles in the patient group, DRB1*11 (50%) appeared
to be more common in the control group.

This report describes the pathological and immunohistochemical findings in
naturally infected lambs from three outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants in
Mugla and Aydin provinces of the Ege district of Turkey. At necropsy, ulcerative 
stomatitis, catarrhal or fibrinous bronchopneumonia, and acute catarrhal
enteritis were observed. Histopathologically, syncytial cells containing
inclusion bodies were seen in the tongue and in the buccal, labial and soft
palate mucosae. In pneumonic lungs, syncytial cells were present in the alveolar 
lumina, and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in epithelial cells of the bronchi and
bronchioli. Immunohistochemically, viral antigen was strongly labelled in the
lung, oral tissues and small intestine.

Lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphism and lipid profile in coronary artery
disease.

Büyükdevrim AS.

Istanbul, Turkey. bsusleyici@khas.edu.tr

CONTEXT: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a central role in lipid metabolism,
hydrolyzing triglyceride in chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins. The
PvuII polymorphic variant of LPL gene is common and might affect risk of coronary
artery disease (CAD).
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether LPL- PvuII polymorphism can be
considered to be an independent risk factor or a predictor for CAD in Turkish
subjects.
DESIGN: We used polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion to
determine the distribution of the previously described C-->T transition that
causes a PvuII polymorphism in intron 6 among healthy blood donors of Turkish
origin and among angiographically confirmed CAD patients with comparable ethnic
backgrounds.
RESULTS: For the PvuII genotypes, within the CAD group (n = 80), the +/- genotype
was found in 39 individuals (48.8%), whereas 25 (31.3%) carried the +/+ genotype,
and 14 (17.5%) carried the -/- genotype. Within the control group (n = 49), the
-/- genotype was found in 19 individuals (38.8%), 16 (32.7%) carried the +/-
genotype, and 14 (28.6%) carried the +/+ genotype. The genotype frequency
distribution was significantly different (P =.049) in the CAD and control study
groups. The most frequent genotype among CAD patients was +/-; this genotype was 
more frequent in patients than in control subjects. However, the -/- genotype was
more prevalent in the control group. Lipoprotein lipase-PvuII polymorphism was
found to be associated with fasting total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels. The +/+ genotype was found to have higher levels of total
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both the CAD and control
groups.
CONCLUSION: There was a difference in the distribution of LPL-PvuII genotypes
between the healthy subjects and the patients with CAD. Lipoprotein lipase-PvuII 
polymorphisms were not detected as independent risk factors for CAD in this study
group, but had associations with lipid levels.

Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the tunica vaginalis of the testis with an adjacent 
uterus-like tissue.

tulunay@medicine.ankara.edu.tr

Testicular and paratesticular neoplasms that resemble the common epithelial type 
of ovarian tumor are quite rare. Paratesticular clear cell carcinoma is very
uncommon in the testis, with no reported cases of a tumor arising from the tunica
vaginalis in the literature to our knowledge. The present case shows that it is
highly malignant and metastatic. The differential diagnosis of the tumor was made
after thorough clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical investigations,
from the mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis, paratesticular serous papillary
carcinoma, carcinoma of the rete testis, epididymal adenocarcioma, yolk sac tumor
of the testis and metastatic carcinoma. The tumor showed Bcl-2 and Her-2/neu
immunoreactivity, but was non-reactive for p53. This tumor, with a uterus-like
structure as a paratesticular tumor-like mass, was composed of endometrial-type
glands and stroma surrounded by bundles of smooth muscle, and is the third
example of this kind of structure in English written literature. The patient,
having normal external genitalia and fertility, represents the first reported
case of paratesticular malignant differentiation of müllerian-type epithelium in 
the normal gonadal state. Müllerian-type epithelium located in the vicinity of
the testis and/or endometriotic metaplasia of the mesothelium of the tunica
vaginalis might be the possible origins for this uterus-like structure, and as a 
result, for this tumor.

Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis is an uncommon disorder. In 
its original description, the presence of linear inflammatory indurations on the 
lateral aspects of the trunk (the rope sign) in association with arthritis were
considered the pathognomonic clinical features. Later cases presenting with
plaques and papules have been reported. Herein we describe a case of interstitial
granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis without the rope sign. The present case
supports the idea that interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis may
have variable clinical appearances.

Human leukocyte antigen-A, -B and -C alleles and human leukocyte antigen
haplotypes in Turkey: relationship to other populations.

Uyar FA(1), Dorak MT, Saruhan-Direskeneli G.

Istanbul, Turkey.

In this study, we present, for the first time, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
class I allele and haplotype frequencies at the DNA level in a sample of 142
donors from Turkey. HLA typing was performed by medium-to-high resolution
polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes method. The
most frequent HLA alleles at class I locus were A*0201(0.257), -B*35(0.204) and
-Cw*04(0.173). A*0201-B*35-Cw*04(0.056) was the most common three-locus
haplotype. Allele and haplotype frequency comparisons and neighbour-joining
dendrograms, constructed using DA genetic distances and correspondence analysis
using HLA-A, -B and -C, and -DRB1 allele frequencies, revealed similarities with 
other Mediterranean and European populations, but not with Mongol populations.
These results agree with previous studies and confirm that the present day
Turkish population is genetically more similar to its geographic neighbours than 
its historical neighbours in central Asia. The comprehensive HLA data on the
Turkish population at the DNA level including up to six-locus putative haplotypes
generated in this study will be useful for further studies.

The importance of cyclin D1 and Ki67 expression on the biological behavior of
pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of cyclin D1 and Ki67 proteins
involved in cell-cycle control as a prognostic factor in pancreatic carcinomas.
We examined formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material from 59 pancreatic
adenocarcinomas, for which appropriate clinical and prognostic data were
available. The standard streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method was used for 
immunostaining with cyclin D1 and Ki67. The extent of positive nuclear and
cytoplasmic cyclin D1 staining was graded semiquantitatively. Ki67 reactivity was
quantified and expressed as the percentage of stained nuclei. Staining with
cyclin D1 and Ki67 was compared with histopathological prognostic features, and
their relation with survival was also tested statistically. Patients whose tumors
were cyclin D1-positive showed perineural invasion significantly more frequently 
than did patients with cyclin D1-negative tumors at the immunohistochemical
level. In addition, tumors with lymphatic vessel invasion and without showed a
significant difference in terms of cytoplasmic cyclin D1 staining. Ki67 indices
were statistically different in stage groups. There was a significant and direct 
correlation between Ki67 index and nuclear cyclin D1 staining scores. No relation
with survival was found. Our results suggest that cell-cycle proteins do not
directly affect the prognosis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Conversely, cyclin D1-positive tumors tend to have perineural invasion more
frequently. In addition, lymph vessel invasion is another factor related to
cyclin D1 reactivity of the cells. Ki67 indices differ statistically in stage
groups.

Prognostic significance of matrix metalloproteinase-2, cathepsin D, and
tenascin-C expression in colorectal carcinoma.

Sis B(1), Sağol O, Küpelioğlu A, Sokmen S, Terzi C, Fuzun M, Ozer E, Bishop P.

Author information:

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and cathepsin D (CD) play a significant role
in degrading the components of basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM), 
whereas tenascin-C (TN-C) is a glycoprotein of the ECM related to cell adhesion
and detachment. These proteins have been implicated in tumor invasion and
metastasis. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the prognostic significance of
MMP-2, CD, and TN-C expressions in primary colorectal cancer. Overall, 112
colorectal adenocarcinomas were included in the present study. MMP-2, CD, and
TN-C expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with
clinicopathologic prognostic parameters and survival. Diffuse stromal TN-C
immunostaining was found to be significantly correlated with advanced stage and
shorter survival time (p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). MMP-2 expression was
found to correlate with lymph vessel invasion (p = 0.006) and stage (p = 0.03).
CD expression was related to depth of invasion (p = 0.005). No significant
relationship was found between survival and MMP-2 and CD expression (p > 0.05).
In multivariate analysis, stage and vascular invasion were independent prognostic
factors, whereas TN-C did not retain a clear independent relationship to survival
(p > 0.05). Our findings suggest that TN-C expression may be a potential
prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma. However, MMP-2 and CD do not appear to
be significant indicators of survival.

Immunohistological comparison of the World Health Organization (WHO) and
Ljubljana classifications on the grading of preneoplastic lesions of the larynx.

Sengiz S(1), Pabuççuoğlu U, Sarioğlu S.

Author information: 
(1)Gölcük State Hospital, Gölcük-Kocaeli, Turkey.

There is still controversy about the classification of laryngeal preneoplastic
lesions. In this study, we compared the World Health Organization (WHO) and
Ljubljana histological classifications with regard to laryngeal epithelial
hyperplastic-dysplastic lesions in a single series to determine their relation to
statistically significant criteria when the mechanisms of neoplastic progression 
are considered. Emphasis was put on p53 expression, proliferative activity, and
angiogenesis. Fifty-four laryngeal biopsies with preneoplastic changes were
re-evaluated and classified according to both classifications. The
streptavidin-biotin method was used for immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67,
p53, and CD34 antibodies. A positive correlation was obtained between the
histological categories and Ki-67, p53, and CD34 expressions using both
classifications (Spearman's Correlation test). There was a significant difference
between the histological categories of both the WHO and the Ljubljana
classifications, when the expression of the three markers was compared (Kruskal
Wallis test, p = 0.000 for each). Further evaluation revealed a statistically
significant difference between all categories of both classifications, excluding 
the p53 overexpression scores and vessel counts in mild and moderate dysplasia
categories (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.209, and 0.091 respectively), and the p53 
overexpression scores in severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ categories
(Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.249) of the WHO classification. Similarly, no
significant differences were found between severe dysplasia and carcinoma in
situ, as well as between atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ categories
using both classifications for the Ki-67 expression (Mann-Whitney U-test, p =
0.806, and 0.111, respectively). Our results suggest that regarding the
mechanisms of neoplastic progression such as p53 expression and angiogenesis, the
histological categories of the Ljubljana classification seem to depend on
additional evidence. Therefore, we support the use of the Ljubljana
classification.

Mazabraud's syndrome: intramuscular myxoma associated with fibrous dysplasia.

The association of fibrous dysplasia and intramuscular myxoma is a rare disease
known as Mazabraud's syndrome. Both lesions tend to occur in the same anatomical 
region. The relationship between fibrous dysplasia and myxoma remains unclear,
where an underlying localized error in tissue metabolism has been proposed to
explain this occasional coexistence. Another example of this syndrome in a 52
year-old woman is reported. The patient presented with a soft tissue mass at the 
anteromedial mid part of the left thigh. After excision of the mass, three
separate bone lesions were detected in her control MRI. The soft tissue mass was 
misdiagnosed as liposarcoma in another center, and the bone lesions were
interpreted as metastasis. The hypocellularity and the indistinct vascular
pattern of the lesion were consistent with myxoma. The Jam-Shidi needle biopsies 
of the osseous lesions were diagnosed as fibrous dysplasia. The recognition of
this entity is important for appropriate management of the patient. Patients with
soft tissue myxomas should be thoroughly examined for fibrous dysplasia. The
greater risk of sarcomatous transformation in fibrous dysplasia with Mazabraud's 
syndrome should also be kept in mind.

Significantly decreased P27 expression in endometrial carcinoma compared to
complex hyperplasia with atypia (correlation with p53 expression).

P27 expression was examined on paraffin-embedded specimens in proliferative,
secretory, hyperplastic and neoplastic human endometrium by immunohistochemistry.
The results of p27 immunoreactivity in endometrial carcinomas were compared with 
clinicopathological indicators as well as with p53 expression. Thirty-eight cases
of endometrial carcinoma, 30 normal functional (15 proliferative, 15 secretory), 
24 hyperplastic endometrium (12 without atypia, 12 with atypia) specimens were
studied by using monoclonal p27 and p53 antibodies. The
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system was used and the intensity and
the distribution of immunoreactivity was evaluated semiquantitatively. p27
expression was present both in the proliferative and secretory phases; the
expression being stronger in the secretory period. In complex hyperplasia with
atypia, p27 expression was even higher and it was significantly reduced in the
endometrial carcinoma group (p<0.05). No significant correlation was found
between p27 expression and any of the clinicopathologic prognostic parameters
(p>0.05). Nuclear p53 expression was detected in 13 (34.2%) patients with
endometrial carcinoma and was higher in non-endometrioid carcinomas and in tumors
with increasing FIGO grade (p<0.05). High expression of p53 was not found to be a
significant prognostic indicator of survival (p>0.05). No p53 expression was
detected in the endometria with proliferation, secretion or hyperplasia either
simple without atypia or complex with atypia. Surprisingly, tumors with
absent/low p27 expression showed absent/low p53 expression. Our data suggest that
p27 is necessary to control the proliferation of endometrium and its loss of
expression seems to play a role in some aspects of endometrial carcinogenesis.

Estrogen receptor codon 594 and HER2 codon 655 polymorphisms and breast cancer
risk.

Akisik E(1), Dalay N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Basic Oncology, Oncology Institute, Istanbul University, 34390
Capa, Istanbul, Turkey.

The estrogen receptor (ER) and the human epithelial growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) genes have been implicated in the development and prognosis of breast
cancer. Several genetic polymorphic sites in these genes have been identified and
associated with the risk of breast cancer. We have investigated the association
between the estrogen receptor codon 594 (ACA to ACG) and HER2 codon 655 (ATC to
GTC) polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. Genomic DNA from breast cancer
patients and control subjects was analyzed by polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). When allelic
frequencies of the ER codon 594 and HER2 codon 655 gene were compared, no
significant differences were observed between the patient and control groups. (P 
= 0.063, OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.25-9.41 and P = 0.949, OR = 1.01, 95% CI =
0.55-1.88, respectively). In conclusion, our results support the view that both
the ER codon 594 and HER2 codon 655 polymorphisms are not associated with
increased risk of breast cancer.

Protective effects of melatonin on the ionizing radiation induced DNA damage in
the rat brain.

Undeger U(1), Giray B, Zorlu AF, Oge K, Baçaran N.

Author information:

University, Ankara, Turkey.

Melatonin is an endogenously produced antioxidant with radioprotective actions
while ionizing radiation is a well-known cytotoxic and mutagenic agent of which
the biological results are attributable to its free radical producing effects.
The effect of melatonin on the DNA strand breakage and lipid peroxidation induced
by ionizing radiation in the rat brain were investigated in order to clarify its 
radioprotective ability. The DNA strand breakage in rat brain exposed to 1000 cGy
ionizing radiation was assessed by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis and
the lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS) concentrations. A significant increase in DNA damage (p <
0.05) and TBARS concentrations (p < 0.01) was found in the radiation treated rat 
brain. Pre-treatment of rats with intraperitoneal doses of 100 mg/kg melatonin
provided a significant decrease in the DNA strand breakage and lipid
peroxidation. Our results indicate that melatonin can protect brain cells from
oxidative damage induced by ionizing radiation.

Hospital, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnostic problems and present our findings in 2
uncommon tumors, malignant myoepithelioma and small cell undifferentiated
carcinoma, by examining fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies of parotid gland
masses.
STUDY DESIGN: The study group consisted of 34 females and 41 males 12-80 years
old, with an average of 44. Excluding inflammatory results, all adequate
aspirates were confirmed histologically to determine the correlation.
RESULTS: Sensitivity of FNA cytology was 91%, with specificity of 98%. We
encountered some difficulties, and therefore misdiagnoses, in evaluating specific
neoplasms, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma and Warthin's tumor, which have
well-established cytologic diagnostic criteria. Two cases of uncommon neoplasms
of salivary glands, small cell undifferentiated carcinoma and malignant
myoepithelioma, were cytologically found to be malignant but not further
classified. In addition, tuberculous parotitis, with its well-defined features,
should to be referred since unnecessary surgery can be avoided by using FNA
cytology.
CONCLUSION: FNA is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for parotid gland
masses. However, specific classification of neoplasms may sometimes be difficult.
Pathologists should be aware of specific entities, such as malignant
myoepithelioma, when evaluating high grade neoplasms.

Our purpose was to determine the reliability of the Pap smear in making the
diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and to examine the characteristics of Pap smear 
vs vaginal culture in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, with the vaginal Gram
stain used as the diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective, blinded study 
involving 245 women who referred to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics
in our hospital for routine genital examination between September 2001 and
September 2002. Exclusion criteria included vaginal bleeding and pregnancy. Each 
patient had standard Pap smear, Gram-stained vaginal smear and culture of vaginal
swab. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and diagnostic value of Pap smear and vaginal culture results
were determined with Gram stain used as the standard for diagnosis of bacterial
vaginosis. Using Gram stain diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as the standard, Pap
smear and vaginal culture test results had sensitivity of 43.1 and 77.8%,
specificity of 93.6 and 97.7%, positive predictive value of 73.8 and 93.3%,
negative predictive value of 79.8 and 91.4%, diagnostic value of 78.8 and 91.8%, 
respectively, for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Compared to the
microbiological test results, Pap smear is not sensitive enough for screening of 
bacterial vaginosis. However, because of its high specificity, it may be an
adequate diagnostic criteria when it is positive.

Differentiation pathways in duodenal and ampullary carcinomas: a comparative
study on mucin and trefoil peptide expression, including gastric and colon
carcinomas.

Gürbüz Y(1), Klöppel G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Kocaeli, Turkey.

Duodenal carcinomas, such as ampullary tumors, may be a heterogeneous group of
neoplasms that share differentiation features with gastric or colorectal
carcinomas. Because of the cell- and tissue-specific expression patterns of
mucins and trefoil peptides, these markers were used to investigate the
differentiation status of duodenal and ampullary carcinomas in comparison with
gastric and colorectal carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas (14 duodenal, 10 gastric, 11
ampullary and 10 colorectal) were examined immunohistochemically for the mucin
gene products MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6 and the trefoil peptides TFF1 and TFF2.
The tumors' expression profile for MUC5AC, MUC6 and TFF1 was used to distinguish 
between gastric- and intestinal-directed differentiation. The mucins that were
most often expressed in the individual tumor types were MUC1 (duodenal and
ampullary carcinomas), MUC2 (colorectal carcinomas) and MUC5AC (gastric
carcinomas). Further classification focusing on the expression profile for
MUC5AC, MUC6 and TFF1 revealed that 21% of the duodenal and 45% of the ampullary 
carcinomas demonstrated mainly gastric differentiation (positivity for all three 
markers or only two of them). The remaining duodenal and ampullary carcinomas
showed nongastric, i.e., intestinal differentiation (all three markers negative
or only one marker positive). The gastric differentiation pattern characterized
60% of gastric carcinomas. Colorectal carcinomas showed intestinal
differentiation in 100% of cases. Duodenal carcinomas have a heterogeneous mucin 
expression pattern that is mainly related to either gastric differentiation or
intestinal differentiation. This also holds for ampullary carcinomas. Among the
markers used, MUC5AC, MUC6 and TFF1 are most useful for revealing differentiation
pathways in duodenal and ampullary carcinoma.

Recent studies have examined the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression in
normal pituitaries and pituitary adenomas and have suggested a role for Cox-2 in 
the regulation of angiogenesis in the pituitary. Thromboxane synthase (TBXAS),
which catalyzes the synthesis of thromboxane A2, is one of the downstream enzymes
in Cox metabolism and appears to play a role in the regulation of invasiveness
and angiogenesis in some neoplasms. To analyze the role of Cox-2 and TBXAS in
pituitary tumor progression, we examined normal pituitaries (n = 8), pituitary
adenomas (n = 174), and pituitary carcinomas (n = 7) for expression of Cox-2 and 
TBXAS by immunohistochemistry. Weak Cox-2 and moderate TBXAS expression was
present in normal pituitary cells. Most pituitary adenomas showed increased
expression of both Cox-2 and TBXAS. Pituitary tumors as a whole, but particularly
carcinomas, showed greater Cox-2 expression than did normal pituitaries.
Pituitary adenomas and carcinomas also showed greater staining for TBXAS when
compared to normal pituitary. Nonfunctional adenomas had significantly higher
levels of TBXAS expression compared to functional adenomas (p = 0.017). Adenomas 
and carcinomas showed similar degrees of staining for TBXAS. In summary, TBXAS
appears to be one of the up-regulated downstream enzymes of Cox metabolism in
pituitary tumors. Both Cox-2 and TBXAS may play an important role in pituitary
tumor development and progression.

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) typically arises as a firm nodule on the extremities of 
young men. The tumor is remarkable for diagnostic difficulties both clinically
and histopathologically resulting in a high frequency of initial misdiagnosis. ES
is also known to have a high rate of recurrence and high rate of metastasis
predominantly to the lymph nodes, lungs, and scalp. Herein, the second case of ES
with metastasis to the tongue is reported.

(1)Suleyman Demirel University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Histology and 
Embryology, Isparta, Turkey.

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of thyroidectomy on the
histology of rat sublingual gland. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats, aged 4
weeks and weighing between 45-55 g, were used. The rats were divided into two
experimental groups (control and thyroidectomy), each containing 14 animals.
Total thyroidectomy of rats was performed under ether anesthesia in thyroidectomy
group. The rats in the control group were sham operated without having the
thyroidectomy. Seven rats randomly selected from both groups were fixed using the
perfusion fixation technique 2 and 6 weeks after thyroidectomy, and their
sublingual glands were harvested for histological investigation. No histological 
difference was observed between the two groups 2 weeks after thyroidectomy.
However, 6 weeks after thyroidectomy considerable cytoplasmic vacuolization of
the epithelial cells of the mucous tubules was seen in the thyroidectomy group
compared to the controls. Enlargement of mucous tubules was also observed, and
the lumina in most of the tubules was quite dilated. In the stroma surrounding
the parenchymal tissues, increased lipid tissue mass was observed. In addition,
increased connective tissue mass and mononuclear cell infiltrations were evident.
Furthermore, the number of mast cells was significantly higher in the
thyroidectomy group than in the controls 6 weeks after thyroidectomy. It was
concluded that the thyroid gland and hormones might have an influence on the
histology of the sublingual gland.

Turkey. eryetkin@ttnet.net.tr

BACKGROUND: Adhesion molecules are expressed on vascular endothelium and on
immune and inflammatory cells. Recently increased levels of adhesion molecules
have been shown in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. This study examined
the serum levels of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1
(ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin in patients 
with rheumatic mitral stenosis and the effects of percutaneous mitral balloon
valvuloplasty (PMBV) on these adhesion molecules.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty five patients (3 men, 32 women, mean age 39+/-5
years) with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis who underwent percutaneous balloon
mitral valvuloplasty, and 35 age and sex matched healthy control subjects were
included in the study. Serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were
measured in all patients who underwent PMBV and in all control subjects. Blood
samples were taken for measurement of adhesion molecules immediately before and
24 h after the mitral balloon valvuloplasty.
RESULTS: The plasma levels of soluble adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1 and
VCAM-1 were significantly elevated in patients with mitral stenosis compared to
control subjects: E-selectin, 97+/-59 vs. 45+/-24 ng/ml (P=.001), sICAM-1,
874+/-301 ng/ml vs. 238+/-82 ng/ml (P<.0001); sVCAM-1, 3056+/-763 ng/ml vs.
985+/-298 ng/ml (P<.0001). Plasma levels of VCAM-1 significantly increased 24 h
after the valvuloplasty procedure (3056+/-763 ng/ml vs. 3570+/-1225 ng/ml
P=.013). Plasma levels of E-selectin showed a significant decrease after PMBV
(97+/-59 vs. 70+/-58 ng/ml, P=.043) and plasma levels of ICAM-1 did not show any 
change after PMBV (874+/-301 vs. 944+/-377 ng/ml, P=.356).
CONCLUSION: Cellular adhesion molecules, sICAM-1, E-selectin, sVCAM-1 have shown 
changes in different directions in response to PMBV. These results necessitate
further studies to clarify the mechanism underlying the association between
adhesion molecules and PMBV as well as rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Neuroendocrine differentiation in gastric adenocarcinomas; correlation with tumor
stage and expression of VEGF and p53.

Studies on neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in conventional gastric
adenocarcinomas and its significance on tumor behavior are limited. Our aim was
to search for the expression of neuroendocrine differentiation in conventional
gastric adenocarcinomas and correlate it with tumor type, stage and expression of
VEGF and p53. Forty-two gastrectomy specimens with gastric adenocarcinoma were
stained with chromogranin A to detect neuroendocrine differentiation and 45% of
the cases were found to be NED (+). No significant correlation was found between 
NED and tumor type. However, NED was more frequent in advanced stage cases
independently of tumor type. VEGF expression was also considerably more frequent 
in NED (+) tumors compared to NED (-) ones (84% vs. 56%). Moreover, we found a
significant correlation between NED and the presence of lymph node metastases.
P53 expression in NED (+) tumors was 68%. There was no significant correlation
between VEGF and p53 in NED (+) cases. In conclusion, neuroendocrine
differentiation is a frequent finding in conventional gastric adenocarcinomas,
and although it does not seem to play a specific role in tumor progression, it
seems that neuroendocrine cells are one of the factors contributing to
angiogenesis by expressing VEGF, especially in advanced stage cases, affecting
the incidence of lymph node metastases. Further studies with larger series should
be performed to confirm this observation.

Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation type 4 and aneurysm of the vein of
Galen: a rare coincidence or possibly related association.

As far as the prognosis is concerned, it is important to diagnose the exact type 
of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) in order to exclude
associated anomalies, as well as the risk of development of malignancies in later
life. The frequency of associated malformations of CCAM type 4 is unknown. We
report a 4-month-old boy with CCAM type 4 and aneurysmal malformation of the vein
of Galen (AVG). Although AVG is the most frequent arteriovenous malformation
during childhood, this is the first case report, to our knowledge, of CCAM type 4
in association with an anomaly. In addition, we speculate that the relation
between CCAM type 4 and AVG appears to be more likely a possibly related
association rather than a rare coincidence, as both malformations develop at the 
same stages of embryonic life, and pathogenetically, apoptosis play a significant
role in both entities. However, further studies are needed to validate this
speculation placing emphasis on the association of the two anomalies, otherwise a
rare coincidence cannot be excluded.

Chorioangioma is the most frequent nontrophoblastic tumor of the placenta with a 
incidence ranging from 0.01 to 1.3%. Vascular anomalies of the placenta
coincidental with infantile hemangioendothelioma (IH) of the liver are rarely
described. Here we report a case of a large chorioangioma of the placenta
associated with cutaneous hemangiomatosis and IH of the liver. The relationship
between hemangiomas and placental chorioangioma is discussed.

Expression of IGR-IR and VEGF and trophoblastic proliferative activity in
placentas from pregnancies complicated by IUGR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir,
Turkey.

Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is recognized as an important cause of low
birth weight and elective preterm delivery. IUGR is associated with multiple
causative factors, including placental dysfunction. The aim of this prospective
study was to investigate the role of trophoblastic proliferative activity and
type I insuline-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) expressions in the pathogenesis of IUGR.
Immunohistochemistry using VEGF, IGF-IR, and Ki-67 antibodies was performed on
formalin-fixed placental tissues of third-trimester pregnancies complicated by
IUGR (n = 19) and pregnancies with appropriately grown fetuses (n = 27). In
addition, histopathological examination of the placentas was performed, and
histological findings were categorized into three groups: utero-placental
vascular pathologies (UPVP), coagulation-related pathologies, and chronic
inflammation. Statistical analysis revealed that villous trophoblastic IGF-IR
immunostaining was significantly weaker in placentas with IUGR (p < 0.001),
whereas trophoblastic Ki-67 proliferative index and VEGF immunoscoring did not
show any significant difference. Histologically, UPVP and chronic inflammation
were significant findings in placentas with IUGR (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04,
respectively). In addition, placentas were significantly smaller in the IUGR
group (p < 0.001). We conclude that villous trophoblastic IGF-IR expression may
play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IUGR, and histopathological
examination of placentas in pregnancies complicated by IUGR may yield significant
findings. In contrast, based on our findings, trophoblastic proliferation and
VEGF expression are unlikely to be significant parameters in the pathogenesis of 
IUGR.

Tenascin C and cathepsin d expression in adipocytic tumors: an
immunohistochemical investigation of 43 cases.

Author information: 
(1)Dokuz Eylül University School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Izmir,
Turkey.

Cathepsin D (CatD) and tenascin C (Tn-C) have been implicated in invasion and
metastasis of carcinomas. However, little is known about CatD and Tn-C
distribution in mesenchymal tumors. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the
expression of Tn-C and CatD in adipocytic tumors. Tn-C and CatD expressions in 27
lipomas, 5 atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcomas (ALT/WDLS) 
and 11 liposarcomas (LS) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and scored
semiquantitatively. CatD expression was higher in ALT/WDLS than in lipomas
(p<0.001), and higher in LS than in ALT/WDLS (p=0.009). Stromal Tn-C expression
was higher in ALT/WDLS than in lipomas (p=0.02), but no difference was observed
between ALT/WDLS and LS (p>0.05). These results indicate that Tn-C and CatD may
be markers of locally aggressive or malignant behavior in adipocytic tumors.

AIMS: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast is an aggressive and
distinctive variant of breast cancer. These tumours have a characteristic
histological appearance and have been associated with a high incidence of
axillary lymph node metastases and a poor clinical outcome. The aims of this
study were to investigate the immunohistochemical profile of invasive
micropapillary carcinoma of the breast, to compare it with invasive ductal
carcinoma, and to identify the morphological parameters which predict its poor
outcome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-three (2.6%) invasive micropapillary carcinomas of the
breast from 2022 cases of infiltrating breast carcinomas were identified by
retrospective review. The patient age at presentation ranged from 33 to 78 years 
(mean 52.5 years). The tumour size ranged from 5 to 70 mm (mean 27 mm).
Eighty-two percent (43 of 53) were of high histological grade; 69% (33 of 48) of 
cases with axillary lymph node dissections had positive lymph nodes; and 75.5%
(40 of 53) had lymphatic invasion: 46% (22 of 48) of cases had extranodal
extension. Of lymph node-positive cases, 61% had four or more metastatic lymph
nodes. Of tumours with tumour size >10 mm, 77% had positive lymph nodes. The
percentages of cases positive for oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone
receptor (PR) were 68% and 61%, respectively. These values were significantly
higher than the values for invasive ductal carcinomas. p53 and c-erbB-2 were
detected in 48% and 54% of cases, respectively. The mean value of Ki67 was 26%.
Follow-up was available in 36 patients. Eight patients had local recurrences,
nine patients had distant metastases, and 10 patients died of disease within a
follow-up period of 9 years.
CONCLUSION: Lymphotropism and an unfavourable prognosis are the hallmarks of this
distinct entity. Prognostic markers such as ER, PR, p53, and c-erbB-2 failed to
provide new criteria to allow discrimination of these tumours from other breast
cancers.

University, Sivas, Turkey. ozdemiro@cumhuriyet.edu.tr

The aim of the present study was to investigate high dose and long-term effects
of a common industrial agent, N'-ethyl-N'-nitrosourea (ENU), on soft tissues in a
rat model. ENU, which was dissolved in polyethyleneglycol (PEG) was injected
intra-peritoneally once a week (300 mg/kg) in the first experimental group. The
second group received only PEG. The control group was free of any agent
administration. Only rats treated with ENU for a period of 45 weeks developed
large subcutaneous tumours (approximately 5-9 cm in size). Tumoral tissues were
examined radiologically, histopathologically and immunohistochemically. There was
no bone destruction beneath the soft tumoral tissues in direct X radiograms.
Computed tomographic (CT) images showed heterogeneous soft tissue masses with a
density ranging from 50 to 65 HU. Macroscopically, all tumors were circumscribed 
with a gray-white surface in the cross-sections. The histopathological and
immunohistochemical examination of the subcutaneous tumoral tissues showed a
spindle cell type of sarcoma. Lymphatic and skeletal muscle invasion, atypical
mitoses and necroses were determined in all tumoral tissues in the experimental
group. A somatic point mutation was detected in exon 2 of KRAS oncogene in
sarcoma tissues using the single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis. In conclusion, the activated KRAS oncogene might contribute to the
progression of subcutaneous sarcoma in experimentally ENU induced rats due to
point mutation.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been associated with an increased generation
of nitric oxide (NO). Different authors have shown that NO in IBD can be either
harmful or protective. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of
intrarectal (i.r.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) application of
N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a non-specific nitric oxide synthase
inhibitor, in experimental acute colitis in the rats. Acute colitis was induced
in rats by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol. Twenty-eight
rats were divided into four groups. L-NAME (50 mg/kg/day) was administered i.p.
(Group 1) and i.r. (Group 2) for 7 days following the day when colitis was
induced. Group 3 rats were not given any treatment after induction of colitis.
Control group rats were given saline solution i.r. instead of TNBS. The presence 
of hyperemia, inflammation and ulcer was evaluated to score of macroscopic
morphologic damage. The severity of colitis was assessed by microscopic criteria 
including ulceration, mucus cell depletion, crypt abscesses, inflammatory cysts, 
mucosal atrophy, edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular dilatation. 
Rectal tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and serum-rectal tissue nitrite
levels were measured. Serum and rectal tissue nitrite levels increased in Group 3
rats. Both i.p. and i.r. L-NAME treatment significantly reduced serum and rectal 
tissue nitrite levels, but no effect on MPO activity and histologic damage score 
was observed. Under the present conditions we concluded i.r. and i.p. L-NAME
treatment, applied at the dosage of 50 mg/kg/day, does not have any protective
effect on the colonic injury.

We present the case of a 45-year-old man who presented with medication-resistant 
chronic bilateral nasal obstruction. The patient had no known history of allergy 
or any other disease. Nasal septoplasty was performed to relieve his symptoms.
Histologically, thick collagen bundles were seen, characteristically whorling
around vessels in a fibrotic stroma. Inflammatory cells, rich in eosinophils,
were scattered throughout the lesion. No granulomas, necrosis, or vessel
destruction were present. A diagnosis of eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis was
made. This neoplasm, which has very characteristic histologic features, is a rare
entity of the sinonasal tract.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the localization of
endothelin-1 (ET-1) immunoreactivity differs in human placental tissues from
third-trimester normal and intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) pregnancies.
Immunohistochemistry for ET-1 was performed on human placentas from 30 IUGR and
30 uncomplicated pregnancies matched for gestational age. The distribution and
intensity of ET-1 immunoreactivity was assessed by a semiquantitative scoring
system. Doppler flow velocity waveform analysis of the umbilical artery was
performed in each patient before delivery. ET-1 was localized diffusely in
placental specimens from normal and IUGR pregnancies. The localization of ET-1
immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the capillary endothelial cells of
villi as well as in the endothelial, decidual, and trophoblastic cells of the
basal plate in placentas from normal pregnancies than from IUGR pregnancies.
There was no significant difference in placental ET-1 immunoreactivity between
IUGR pregnancies with normal and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler flow velocity 
waveforms. Placental ET-1 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the
decidual and trophoblastic cells of the basal plate and the capillary endothelial
cells of villi in normal pregnancies than in IUGR pregnancies with normal
umbilical artery Doppler flow velocity waveforms. However, only the decidual and 
trophoblastic cells of the basal plate demonstrated significantly higher abundant
localization of ET-1 immunoreactivity in normal pregnancies than in IUGR
pregnancies with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler flow velocity waveforms. In
conclusion, our findings suggest that the lower expression of ET-1 in placental
tissues from IUGR pregnancies might be secondary to an adaptive mechanism to
reduce the vasoconstrictor effect of ET-1.

Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma of unknown histogenesis and occurs
predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults. The head and neck is a
relative rare location. There are about 10 cases with laryngeal localization in
the literature. We present a 24 year-old male with an endolaryngeal mass.
Incisional biopsy and the hemilaryngectomy material revealed a biphasic synovial 
sarcoma. One year later a local recurrence occurred. Tumor excision and neck
dissection were performed. Radiotherapy was added. Six months later lung
metastases was discovered on thoracic CT. The patient received chemotherapy for 6
courses. The metastases responded well to chemotherapy and the patient is now
alive without tumor on radiological and clinical examination after 3.5 years of
follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the sputum smear cytology and cell block methods for
specimen adequacy, cytology quality and diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of
lung cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: We assessed 2,524 sputum specimens from 768 patients. The specimens
were prepared as smears and cell blocks for cytopathologic examination between
March 1, 1992, and December 31, 1998. The smear and cell block slides were
evaluated both separately and together, and the results were compared with
radiologic and histopathologic diagnoses.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the smear method was 69.4% and specificity was 99.5%.
The sensitivity of the cell block method was 84.4% and specificity, 100%. The
sensitivity of the smear and cell block together was 87.6% and specificity,
99.5%.
CONCLUSION: The cell block method increases the sensitivity and specificity of
sputum cytology, and when smear and cell block slides are evaluated together,
sensitivity reaches its highest value. Therefore, application of smear and cell
block methods together seems most useful in the diagnosis of lung cancer.

The identification of prognostic parameters in ependymomas remains an important
but controversial issue in particular to the significance of histopathological
features. Intracranial location is a rare presentation for adult ependymomas. DNA
ploidy status and nuclear morphometric features of ependymomas are not
well-established. We retrospectively studied the clinicopathologic features of 12
adult intracranial ependymomas and performed image cytometric DNA analysis with
nuclear morphometry. The overall survival rate was 75%. Two cases were anaplastic
ependymomas. Statistically, histology failed to demonstrate a correlation with
clinical outcome or overall survival. DNA ploidy (p = 0.033), DNA index (p =
0.016) and 5c exceeding rate (p = 0.017) were statistically correlated with
clinical outcome, but not correlated with overall survival. Nuclear morphometric 
features measured using 3 different data selection methods were not correlated
with clinical outcome or overall survival. It is difficult to identify prognostic
factors in a series of cases with limited number. The problem is complicated by
the fact that the common criteria used for recognizing malignancy in gliomas are 
not completely reliable in ependymomas. Nuclear morphometric findings support the
general impression that ependymomas are morphologically highly variable tumors.
In spite of the small sample size of our series and other factors influencing
survival such as the extent of resection and malignant histology, aneuploidy can 
be suggested as a promising factor, which may reflect potential aggressiveness of
the tumor in adult intracranial ependymomas.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Forensic Medicine of the Medical Faculty of Suleyman Demirel
University, Isparta, Turkey.

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the relationship between skull
fractures and intracranial lesions following head injury. For this purpose, 500
cases, which were referred to the Third Committee of Council of Forensic Medicine
in Istanbul due to traffic accidents by the courts of laws between 1998 and 2000,
were examined retrospectively. They were categorized in 3 groups based on
findings of their cranium x-rays and brain tomographies. 1- The cases who have
fractures in skull bones with brain lesions 2- The cases who have fractures in
skull bones with no brain lesions 3- The cases who have brain lesions with no
skull fractures. They were examined in detail according to age, sex, localization
of skull fractures and brain lesions, and if surgery was applied or not. Of the
cases, 152 (30.4%) had only linear fractures, 69 (13.8%) had depressed fractures,
92 (18.4%) had linear fractures plus intracranial lesions, 49 (9.8%) had
depressed fractures plus intracranial lesions and 138 (27.6%) had only
intracranial lesions. The rate of intracranial lesion among the cases with the
skull fracture was 38.9% (141/362), while the rate of skull fracture among the
cases with the intracranial lesion was 50.3% (141/279) (P < 0.001). Male to
female ratios were 2.4/1 for linear fractures, 5.2/1 for depressed fractures, and
3.5/1 for intracranial lesions. Linear fractures were more frequent among females
whereas depressed fractures were often among males (chi2: 9.68, df: 4, p: 0.046).
The mean age was 26.3. The rate of depressed fractures was higher the age groups 
of 0-30 years. (chi2: 16.28, df: 4, p: 0.003). Depressed fractures in the regions
of frontal and parietal and, linear fracture in the regions of temporal and
occipital were found at higher rates (P < 0.001). In conclusion, we reviewed
skull fractures and/or intracranial lesions due to traffic accidents, and found
depressed fractures to be more common among males whereas linear fractures to be 
more common among females and young males. In the male, the skull architecture is
thicker and stronger than females and young males. We can state that presence of 
skull fractures lowers the incidence of intracranial lesions by lowering the
intracranial pressure.

The effects of sodium phosphate and polyethylene glycol-electrolyte bowel
preparation solutions on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis in
the rat.

Turkey.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of sodium phosphate (NaP)
and polyethylene glycol-electrolyte (PEG-EL) colon cleansing solutions on
histopathology of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol
(E)-induced colitis in the rat and normal rat colon. The presence of hyperemia,
inflammation and ulcer was evaluated to score of macroscopic morphologic damage. 
The microscopic criteria including ulceration, mucus cell depletion, crypt
abscesses, inflammatory cysts, mucosal atrophy, edema, inflammatory cell
infiltration, and vascular dilatation were evaluated to determine the extent of
inflammatory reaction. Colitis findings were determined on the rats which were
administered TNBS-E. Aphthoid lesions were seen 30% and 20 % of rats,
respectively, by NaP and PEG-EL solutions in healthy group. Microscopic
examination of aphthoid lesions revealed edema within the lamina propria and
lymphoid hyperplasia in the mucosa and submucosa without erosion, ulceration and 
inflammatory cell infiltration. No significant difference was statistically found
either macroscopically or microscopically in terms of the effects of saline, NaP 
and PEG-EL solutions in healthy rats and rats with colitis (p > .05). Under the
present conditions, we concluded administration of NaP and PEG-EL solutions did
not cause evident morphological changes on the rectal mucosa macroscopically and 
microscopically, although in a proportion of rats aphthoid lesions seem as a
marker of mucosal damage macroscopically.

Anti-fibrogenic effects of captopril and candesartan cilexetil on the hepatic
fibrosis development in rat. The effect of AT1-R blocker on the hepatic fibrosis.

Tuncer I(1), Ozbek H, Ugras S, Bayram I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gastroenterology, Yuzuncu Yil University Medical Faculty, Van,
Turkey. iltuncer@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND/AIM: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II (AT-II)
have been suggested to play an important role in liver fibrogenesis. There is a
significant relationship between inheritance of hightened expression of
transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and AT-II and the development of
progressive hepatic fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
effects of captopril, an ACE inhibitor and candesartan cilexetil, an AT-II type 1
receptor (AT1-R) blocker, on liver fibrosis induced in rats by carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4) administration.
METHODS: rats were divided into 4 experimental groups: The first group was given 
CCl4 alone; the second was given both CCl4 and captopril (100 mg x kg(-1) x
day(-1)); the third was given both CCl4 and candesartan cilexetil (8 mg x kg(-1) 
x day(-1)); fourth group was given 0.9% NaCl only. Seven weeks after initiating
the treatment, indices of fibrosis were assessed.
RESULTS: Candesartan cilexetil treatment significantly reduced the fibrosis
development. These inhibitory effects were not observed in the captopril-treated 
group. The mean fibrosis score was significantly lower in the CCl4/candesartan
group compared with the group applied to CCl4 alone and the group applied to
CCl4/captopril. Similarly, the number of alpha-smooth muscle actin positive cells
was markedly suppressed by candesartan treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that AT-II plays a pivotal role in hepatic
fibrogenesis and candesartan significantly attenuates the progression of liver
fibrosis. This drug may provide an effective new strategy for prevention of liver
fibrosis. Its effectiveness should be investigated in chronic liver disease
associated with progressive fibrosis.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the diagnostic agreement and intra- and
inter-observer reproducibility of the World Health Organization/International
Society of Urologic Pathology Consensus Classification of Urothelial Neoplasms
(1998 WHO/ISUP classification) and the 1973 WHO classification.
METHODS: A teaching set with 5 slides of each papillary neoplasm of low malignant
potential, low-grade papillary carcinoma, high-grade papillary carcinoma, and a
guideline, as well as a study set of 30 slides containing ten cases of each
category, were sent to participants. Six pathologists expert in urological
pathology reviewed the 30 slides of non-invasive papillary urothelial tumors in
the study set. Diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility were evaluated using
intra- and inter-rater techniques (kappa statistic).
RESULTS: A moderate to substantial intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was 
achieved for both the 1998 WHO/ISUP and 1973 WHO classification. The results of
the two classification systems were not different statistically ( P>0.05).
Reproducibility was lower in low-grade tumors for both classifications.
CONCLUSIONS: The new proposed classification system for non-invasive urothelial
neoplasms does not increase the reproducibility. There is still a need for
uniformity in grading in order to compare the different studies and therapies and
to provide more accurate information for management.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type
1.

Bilgic B(1), Ates LE, Demiryont M, Ozger H, Dizdar Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Medicine Faculty, Capa,
Istanbul, Turkey.

We report 4 cases of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) with
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mean age was 29.5. Two of them had a family
history. Three of them were male. All of them had enlarging mass and pain in the 
background of neurofibromas. Locations were popliteal, thigh and forearm. The
masses were greater than 5 cm in diameter in each case. In two cases the mass was
showing continuity with a nerve. One patient had a nonossifying fibroma as well
as a MPNST. Wide excision and radiotherapy were applied to three of the patients.
One of them did not take any therapy after surgical resection. Two of the
patients died of lung metastases after a mean period of 12.5 months. In a
majority of NF1 patients MPNST emerges from a preexisting neurofibroma. The
patients with NF1 are at greatest risk for developing sarcomas, so they should be
followed closely.

Syringoma is a benign tumors of eccrine sweat gland. They appear as multiple,
tiny, firm, skin-colored papules. Vulvar involvement of syringoma is rare. Only
24 cases with vulvar syringoma have been previously reported in the literature.
The majority of patients with vulvar syringomas are asymptomatic. A case of
syringoma of the vulva exacerbated during pregnancy is presented. The case
appears remarkable for the experienced aggravated pruritic symptoms of the
patient during her pregnancy.

Both squamous cell carcinoma and carcinosarcoma of the renal pelvis are uncommon.
We report on two cases, one carcinosarcoma and one squamous cell carcinoma of the
renal pelvis. In the patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the left kidney, the
tumor was neither detectable on preoperative radiological evaluation nor grossly 
visible in the surgical specimen. This patient, a 56-year-old man, presented with
left lumbar pain, hematuria, fever, 4-5 kg weight loss, and untreated
nephrolithiasis of the left kidney that had been diagnosed 20 years earlier. The 
second patient, an 87-year-old woman, also had a long history of left kidney
nephrolithiasis and presented with left lumbar pain and hematuria. Both patients 
underwent nephrectomy for removal of the non-functioning hydronephrotic left
kidney. In both cases, microscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed 
squamous metaplasia and dysplasia in the pelvicalyceal mucosa, and islands of
atypical squamous cells in the renal parenchyma. In the second case, the kidney
also showed sarcomatous changes in the pelvis.

Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN): a new tool in the diagnosis of central
neurocytoma.

Soylemezoglu F(1), Onder S, Tezel GG, Berker M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara,
Turkey. fsoyleme@hacettepe.edu.tr

The use of neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) as a reliable neuronal marker in the
differential diagnosis of clear cell neoplasms of the central nervous system was 
determined in a biopsy series of 23 cases. Immunohistochemical analyses were
carried out by antisera against neuronal nuclear antigen, synaptophysin,
neuron-specific enolase, microtubule-associated protein 2, and glial fibrillary
acidic protein. All eight central neurocytomas were characteristically
immunolabeled by NeuN. NeuN immunoreactivity was uniformly strong and basically
located in the nuclei of neurocytes. Despite this uniform staining pattern of
central neurocytomas, 12 cases of oligodendrogliomas and three cases of
ependymoma were negative for NeuN. As the diagnostic criteria for central
neurocytoma include immunohistochemical and/or ultrastructural evidence for
neuronal differentiation, NeuN as a sensitive and specific neuronal marker in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues may greatly facilitate the differential
diagnosis of central neurocytomas.

Comment in
    Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord. 2003 Jul-Sep;17(3):137-8.

The objective is to study risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) in Istanbul,
Turkey. This is a population-based case-control study. We screened people over
age 70 in the community for cognitive impairment. The screen positives and a
proportion of screen negatives underwent neurologic examination in the second
phase. Cases were 57 "probable" AD patients and controls were 127 cognitively
normal individuals identified by neurologic examination. Odds ratios (OR) were
calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Having a
university/college degree had a protective effect on AD risk (OR = 0.10, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.02-0.50). Exposure to occupational electromagnetic
field had an OR of 4.02 (95% CI = 1.02-15.78). Use of electricity for residential
heating also showed elevated risk (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.12-6.85). Our results
suggest that having a higher education is protective from AD and that
electromagnetic field exposure at work or at home is a significant risk factor.

We report herein a case of a 61-year-old woman who was found to have a mass
adjacent to the left atrium. The tumor was resected giving least damage to the
left atrium on cardiopulmonary bypass with a subsequent histological diagnosis of
a schwannoma. Neurogenic tumors comprise 10% to 34% of mediastinal tumors. Nerve 
sheath tumors are more common in adults than in children, and these are equally
malignant in children and adults. Nerve sheath tumors of the heart are extremely 
rare. Although there are many malignant cardiac neurilemomas reported, only a few
cases of benign schwannomas have been reported. We describe a rare primary benign
schwannoma of the left atrium.

sayeste@hacettepe.edu.tr

To review the cytologic criteria used in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis
cases [Bv (+)], 2,841 Papanicolaou-stained vaginal smears were examined
cytologically. Clue cells and other cytologic findings were observed in 94 of
2,841 (3.30%) vaginal smears. To detect Bv(+) cases, 94 vaginal smears were
screened again. Clue cells, profuse free cocci among cornified type epithelial
cells, absence of PMNLs, and vaginal Lactobacilli were detected in 43 of 94
(45.74%). The observation of free cocci which resembled a nebulous appearance was
detected first in this study. These four cytologic criteria strongly suggested
Bv(+) cases (n = 43). Although clue cells were seen in 51 of 94 (54.25%) vaginal 
smears, due to the presence of abundant PMNLs, metaplastic cells, vaginal
Lactobacilli, and some infectious agents, mainly Trichomonas vaginalis and
yeasts, they were considered bacterial vaginosis negative [Bv(-)]. It was
postulated that 51 vaginal smears might be aerobic vaginitis. In conclusion, if
vaginal smears contain profuse PMNLs, some infectious agents, and metaplastic
cells, and even clue cells have been observed they are not accepted as Bv(+)
cases.

Yil, Zeve Kampusu, 65080 Van, Turkey. mygulbahar@hotmail.com

A female 8-month-old Simmental calf was presented with a history of a gradually
enlarging mass in the ventral abdominal skin since 4 months of age. The mass was 
well circumscribed, lightly pigmented, and rough surfaced with many fine fissures
and was attached to the skin by a relatively broad pedicle. On cut section, there
was a border between the reddish-black stroma and overlying epithelium, including
hemorrhagic foci of variable sizes. Histologically, the tumor was papillomatous
with angiokeratomatous features and irregular hyperplasia with epidermal rete
ridges and dilated vascular channels filled with blood in the superficial dermis.
In the epidermis, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, variably sized keratohyalin
granules, and many koilocytes, some of which had papillomavirus (PV)
genus-specific structural antigen-positive nuclei, were also observed. Cells
lining the dilated vascular spaces were positive for vimentin and alpha-smooth
muscle actin but negative for factor VIII-related antigen, desmin, and PV. The
lesion was regarded as an angiokeratomatous papilloma and was similar to other
angiomatous lesions.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the importance of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 17 cytologic and 5 architectural features in a series
of 320 FNACs from HCC and compared them with 73 FNACs from benign lesions and
with 705 FNACs from metastatic carcinomas. One thousand ninety-eight patients who
were diagnosed by liver FNAC between December 1988 and July 1998 and had adequate
follow-up were included in the study. The specimens were evaluated according to
the presence or absence of the cytologic features and cellular arrangement. A
stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed on the data to determine the 
variables predictive of HCC.
RESULTS: Multinucleated tumor giant cells, cytoplasmic hyaline and central
sinusoidal pattern were selected as the 3 most predictive parameters for
differentiated reactive hepatocytes from HCC (P < .0001), while bile, centrally
located nucleus in an atypical cell and intranuclear inclusion were selected as
the 3 most predictive parameters for differentiated metastatic carcinoma from HCC
(P < .0001-< .001) by stepwise logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: In the 1,098 patients suspected of having hepatic malignancy, a
correct diagnosis was made by a combination of the above features. The
sensitivity of this procedure for hepatic malignancy was 99.5%, and the
specificity was 100%.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, Ministry of Health, Ankara Research Hospital, Ankara,
Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Miyoshi myopathy is an autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy. It is
characterized by distal muscle involvement, especially the gastrocnemius and
soleus. The disease starts with weakness and atrophy of the calves.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we report on 2 patients, brother and sister, from a
Turkish family. Onset of the disease was at the age of 20 and 26 years of age,
respectively. In both siblings, there was an early and predominant involvement of
the distal muscles of the lower limbs. Creatine kinase activity was elevated 50- 
to 100-fold above normal values.
RESULTS: Electromyography revealed a myopathic pattern. Histology of the biceps
muscles indicated some myopathic changes consistent with muscular dystrophy.
Occurrence in only these 2 siblings with no other family members was indicative
of an autosomal recessive inheritance.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the distinctive clinical features in 2 siblings of a
Turkish family with MM as differential diagnosis and histological change.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of p53 and mdm2 and to
determine whether they may be used as additional predictors of recurrence in
superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Paraffin sections of 80
patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, who were
treated with transurethral resection, were stained with p53 and mdm2 antibodies
using the standard avidin biotin immunoperoxidase method. Nuclear staining for
both p53 and mdm2 was calculated as the percentage of labeled nuclei out of a
total number of tumor cells counted. The percentage of p53- and mdm2-positive
cells showed a significant relationship with tumor grade and recurrence (p =
0.002 and p = 0.016; p = 0.01 and p = 0.003, respectively). In addition, a weak
inverse relationship was found between p53 and mdm2 values (r = -0.184). p53 and 
mdm2 reactivities are valuable parameters in predicting recurrence in superficial
bladder cancer. Thus, mdm2 expression appears to play a role in predicting
biologic behavior in superficial transitional carcinoma of the bladder.

During educational dissections we observed a phrenic ganglion on the nerve of the
phrenic artery originating from the upper pole of the right coeliac ganglion,
which accompanied the right inferior phrenic artery on a female cadaver at the
age of 34. In our case the left coeliac ganglion, the inferior phrenic artery,
the right and left greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves were present and
normal. However, the left nerve of the phrenic artery and the phrenic ganglion
were absent. We consider that this rarely reported neural formation may be of
importance for anatomists and clinicians.

Turkey. saitsen@med.ege.edu.tr

Early diagnosis and classification of amyloid deposition and differentiation from
other glomerular fibrillar deposits relies on routine Congo red (CR)
histochemistry. Congo red fluorescence (CRF) is an alternative method based on
examination of the CR-stained section by ultraviolet (UV) light. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the usefulness of CRF, especially when applied to frozen 
kidney sections. Congo red fluorescence was applied to sections of frozen kidney 
biopsies prospectively and to paraffin sections retrospectively. The findings of 
CRF were compared to CR staining in bright light. Prospectively, 15 cases of
amyloidosis were diagnosed on frozen sections and identical CR staining was found
in all of the paraffin-stained sections. There were no false positives or
negatives. Retrospectively, 146 renal biopsies previously stained with CR were
re-evaluated with CRF. Eighty-seven CR positive cases were confirmed by CRF, and 
one new case was identified. Congo red fluorescence is simple to perform and more
pronounced, therefore easier to evaluate than CR in bright light. Congo red, when
combined with immunohistochemistry, is still visible under UV whereas CR is
masked in bright light. Although not widely used, the CRF method for detecting
amyloid is simple to use with a high specificity and sensitivity, and may be
applied successfully to frozen sections.

BACKGROUND: Long-term preservation of immunofluorescence is important for
re-examinations. We investigated whether the storage of direct immunofluorescent 
(DIF)-positive slides at room temperature was reliable in daily practice.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five DIF-positive slides from the skin of 52
patients were evaluated. Sections were examined for the presence of
immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen using fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated antisera and mounted with a ready-to-use permanent
mounting medium containing an antifading reagent and sodium azide (DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark, S3023). The slides were stored at room temperature for 16-24
months. Changes in diagnostic pattern, fluorescence intensity, and the form and
location of accumulation of immunoreactants and technical deformation were
investigated.
RESULTS: Over the entire observation period, 49.6% of the slides faded away; the 
median length of survival was 16 months. Before 12 months, the survival rate of
slides was 92.0%, whereas after 20 months it was 28.0%. In the early faded
slides, which faded away before 16 months following the first examination, C3 and
IgA were the most frequently observed immunoreactants. The technical deformations
did not prevent the diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The preservation of fluorescence in DIF-positive slides using
mounting media with an antifading reagent is possible for 2 years at room
temperature. However, in daily practice, storage for longer than 11 months
prevents a reliable diagnosis.

Is Nothingham Prognostic Index correlated with apoptosis and p53 expression in
infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast?

ebodur@ada.net.tr

The role of p53 as a prognostic factor is not clear. P53 named as "guardian of
the genome" plays an important role in many intracellular regulatory systems, one
of which is apoptosis, having an impact on tumor kinetics. A retrospective study 
was undertaken to assess the relationship of the Nothingham Prognostic Index
(NPI) to p53 expression and apoptotic cell counts. To conduct the study, 160
successive cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast were included.
P53 was assessed on AP-AAP stained sections. Apoptotic cell counting (ACC) was
done on the HE stained routine sections in 10 HPFs. Clinical data were derived
from the hospital files. Apoptotic cell counts were higher in the p53 positive
group but the difference was not significant (p=0.079). P53 positivity was found 
to be related to the disease-free survival (DFS) (p=0.008). NPI was significantly
higher in apoptotic cell containing group (p=0.006). There was a positive linear 
correlation between ACC and NPI scores (p=0.004). This correlation was not
present between apoptosis and disease free survival. P53 expression was found to 
be related with DFS but not with the NPI which is a score composed of the best
prognostic indicators known today. In contrast to this, ACC was found to be
closely and linearly associated to the known prognostic factors. This may suggest
that the apoptotic cell counts done on routine sections may be used as a part of 
prognosis assessment in infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

Glycogen rich clear cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare neoplasm with
different morphological characteristics to ordinary breast carcinomas. However,
it has some common features with clear cell carcinomas of other organs. This
report describes a case of clear cell carcinoma of the breast with a solid
papillary pattern centrally localised in the left breast of a 45 year old woman. 
Antibodies directed against cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK10, CK14, CK17, CK18, CK19,
CK20, CK5/6/18, CK8/18, high molecular weight cytokeratin AE3, high molecular
weight cytokeratin 34betaE12, the oestrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, 
chromogranin, S-100 protein, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and
carcinoembryogenic antigen were applied to analyse the immunophenotypical profile
of this rare neoplasm.

The place of fine-needle aspiration in the preoperative diagnosis of the
congenital sublingual teratoid cyst.

The term "teratoid cyst" was first used by Meyer in his classification of
dysontogenetic cysts of the cervicofacial region, which was based on the type of 
germinative layers included in the cyst wall. Sublingual location of a dermoid
cyst is not common, with an incidence of 1.6%. The teratoid cyst is the least
common, accounting for 1.8% of sublingual dermoid cysts, and such lesions are
extremely rare in infancy. In our case, a 7-mo-old male infant was referred with 
a sublingual mass. Ultrasonography yielded a cystic mass with internal echoes but
no specific diagnosis. The smears obtained from fine-needle aspiration (FNA)
displayed sheets of large, benign-appearing, anucleated and nucleated squamous
cells. There were a number of neutrophils, which had no significant importance.
No atypical cells were observed. According to the clinical picture and FNA
findings, it appeared to be a cystic structure of keratogenous origin and could
have been any type of dermoid cyst. The cyst was excised completely by the oral
approach. On histopathological examination, the presence of skin appendages along
with mature cartilage and respiratory epithelium confirmed the final diagnosis of
a teratoid cyst. In conclusion, although FNA is not comparable with computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it might be valuable for
the diagnosis of lesions occurring in this anatomical location. It is safe,
cost-effective, and reliable. FNA is not only able to help selecting the most
appropriate surgical method, but also be used as a therapeutic modality in some
emergencies or during surgery.

Angiogenesis, p53, and bcl-2 expression as prognostic indicators in endometrial
cancer: comparison with traditional clinicopathologic variables.

We investigated the relation of expression of tumor-suppressor gene product p53, 
apoptosis-regulator gene product bcl-2, and CD34 (as a measure of microvessel
density [MVD]) with traditional clinicopathologic prognostic variables in
endometrial carcinoma (histologic type, grade, depth of myometrial invasion,
angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node involvement). In specimens from 63 patients
with endometrial carcinoma, the mean MVD (64.38+/-28.71 microvessels per 200x
field) was not related to any clinicopathologic variables. Nuclear p53 expression
was detected in 15 (23.8%) patients and was higher in nonendometrioid carcinomas 
(p<0.05) and in tumors with increasing histologic grade (p<0.001). Cytoplasmic
bcl-2 staining was seen in 79.3% of the tumors. There was a negative correlation 
between bcl-2 expression and histologic type and tumor grade (p<0.05). In
survival analysis, patient age, FIGO stage, high expression of p53, low
expression of bcl-2, and high and intermediate MVD values were found to be the
most significant prognostic indicators of survival (p<0.05). In multivariate
regression analysis, FIGO stage and low bcl-2 expression were found to be the
only independent indicators of prognosis (p<0.05).

Ultrastructural evaluation of the effect of endosulfan on mice kidney.

Caglar Y(1), Kaya M, Belge E, Mete UO.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology-Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, 
Adana, Turkey. ycaglar@cu.edu.tr

In this study, the effect of the endosulfan on mice kidney was investigated at
ultrastructural level. Moreover, biochemical analyses (G6PD, CAT, SOD, GSH and
MDA) were determined in supernatant of kidney tissue. Endosulfan (13mg/kg/day
body weight) was administered orally to mices via intragastric-during 10 days.
The presence of mitochondrial degeneration in cytoplasm of proximal convoluted
tubule cells were a striking feature. Furthermore, there was lipofuscin granules 
and membranous structures in some of proximal convoluted tubule cells. In some
glomeruli, ultrastructural changes such as fusion in pedicels and focal
thickening at glomerular basal membrane were seen. There were cytoplasmic bulges 
in some distal convoluted tubule cells. The biochemical results of the
experimental group were significant when compared to the control. The effect of
the endosulfan was mainly on the proximal convoluted tubule cells. Morever, the
other parts of the nephron were effected. Thus, this degeneration in kidney may
be thought that oxidative stress may play a role to the mediator in changing
configuration of cell membrane and seem to account for the morphologic alteration
of kidney.

Expression of heat-shock proteins hsp27, hsp70 and hsp90 in malignant epithelial 
tumour of the ovaries.

Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the role of the small
heat-shock protein group hsp27, hsp70 and hsp90 in the clinical outcome of
several malignancies. However, conflicting data exist regarding the prognostic
role of hsp27 expression in ovarian carcinoma, and the prognostic significance of
hsp70 and hsp90 expression still remains unknown in these tumours. The purpose of
this study was to investigate immunohistochemically whether hsp27, hsp70 and
hsp90 expression was associated with clinicopathological parameters and survival 
in 52 epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier and Cox
regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Among clinicopathological
parameters, hsp27, hsp70 and hsp90 expression was only correlated with FIGO
stage; hsp70 and hsp90 positivity failed to detect survival. However, the overall
survival rate of patients with hsp27 expression was 13%, which was significantly 
worse than that of patients without hsp27 expression (47%) (p<0.01). The
prognosis was also adversely affected by FIGO stage (p<0.01) and presence of
ascites (p<0.01). In multivariate analysis, hsp27 expression and FIGO stage were 
independent prognostic variables. Our results indicate that hsp70 and hsp90
expression had no prognostic relevance in epithelial ovarian carcinomas. However,
hsp27 expression and FIGO stage in these tumours could be reliable indicators of 
prognosis.

Comamonas testosteroni, a lesser-known member of the genus, has shown little
apparent capacity for causing infections in humans. We here present a case of
purulent meningitis due to C. testosteroni, which occurred in a patient who had
recurrent cholesteatoma. Ceftriaxone treatment was not effective in this patient 
even though in vitro the bacteria were susceptible to the drug. The patient
responded well to meropenem therapy.

Metastatic spread of malignant astrocytomas is rare and documented in very few
patients with this tumor. Both pathologists and clinicians may confront more of
these cases as the patients live longer. We present a 40-year-old-man with
glioblastoma multiforme metastasizing to the supraclavicular lymph node after
surgery. The tumor was located at the parietal convexity and several
lymphadenopathies occured after surgery.

Diyarbakir, Turkey. sgoren@dicle.edu.tr

Despite the well-documented increases in the rate of completed suicide among
children, accurate knowledge of the characteristics of these suicides is limited.
We examined all suicides by children and adolescents in Diyarbakir during 1999
and 2001. All of the cases were analyzed regarding the age, sex, method and
location of suicide, time of year, and predictive factors. There were 56 children
aged 11 through 19 years. Adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age constituted 
the overwhelming number (87%) of all the childhood suicides. Female children and 
adolescents predominated among the suicide victims (71%). The most frequent means
of suicide were firearms (43%), hanging (28%), and jumping (16%), respectively.
The majority of suicides occurred at the decedent's home (88%). Reasons
identified were mainly psychiatric disorders, followed by troubles within the
family. A prior suicide attempt or a note that was left by the decedent and
elucidated the reason for the suicide was rare. There was no seasonal difference 
in rates of suicides.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major regulator of angiogenesis
and may be produced by some cancer cells. Several recent reports have documented 
that increased expression of VEGF is associated with risk of recurrence or
decreased recurrence-free survival in papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). The aims
of this study were to determine whether immunohistochemical expression of VEGF is
related to local and distant recurrence of PTC and to evaluate the relationship
between hypervascularization and VEGF expression in papillary thyroid carcinomas.
VEGF expression was examined immunohistochemically in 48 papillary carcinomas.
Ten normal thyroids were used as controls. Patients were followed for 61.7 (range
24-143) months. Twelve of the patients had local and distant recurrences. VEGF
immunostaining, blinded for clinicopathological data, was evaluated
semiquantitatively by two pathologists. The difference between the recurrent
(n:12) and nonrecurrent (n:36) carcinomas was statistically significant
(p:0.001). VEGF expression was also stronger in papillary thyroid carcinomas than
in normal thyroid tissues. The mean microvascular densities were significantly
higher than in normal thyroid tissues. These data indicate that VEGF staining is 
strongly associated with increased frequency of local and distant recurrence in
PTC and that the immunohistochemical profile of the expression may be used as a
marker for predicting which tumors have metastatic potential.

School of Medicine, 07070 Antalya, Turkey. dilara@med.akdeniz.edu.tr

AIM: We evaluated the performance of Helicoblot 2.1 which differentiates the
reactivity to each of the various Helicobacter pylori antigens, and compared the 
results with those obtained by standard techniques (rapid urease test and
histological examination of gastric biopsy) in symptomatic children of different 
ages living in Antalya, Turkey.
METHODS: Eighty-eight children (mean age, 9.15 years) were divided into two
groups. The first group included 66 children who were found to be infected with
H. pylori. The second group included 22 children who were negative for H. pylori.
Serum samples collected from all patients were tested for H. pylori IgG
antibodies by immunoblot assay (Helicoblot 2.1).
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
for detection of H. pylori infection were 80%, 100%, 100% and 85%, respectively. 
In children under 7 years of age, the sensitivity of the test was found to be
lower than other age groups (P<0.05). No relationship was found between peptic
ulcer and cagA antibody positivity (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Helicoblot 2.1 is a useful non-invasive diagnostic tool for H. pylori
infection in children over 6 years of age.

Primary lung tumors mimicking the salivary gland-type neoplasms are extremely
rare. These types of tumors originate from submucosal bronchial glands.
Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma is an uncommon tumor in this group, and only 7
cases have been reported. It is considered to be a low-grade malignant neoplasm. 
We report a case of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of bronchial gland origin 
in a 73-year-old man who presented with coughing and dyspnea. The bronchus of the
left lower lobe contained a tumor mass that had a polypoid growth pattern. The
tumor also extended into the pulmonary parenchyma, forming a well-circumscribed
mass with a pushing margin. The tumor consisted of epithelial and myoepithelial
cells. The epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratins and epithelial
membrane antigen, while the myoepithelial cells were positive for S100 protein
and muscle-specific actin. According to these findings, we diagnosed
epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. After undergoing pneumonectomy, the patient
has been disease free for 34 months.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Hand Surgery Division,
Istanbul University, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.

Twenty-five patients with irreversible leprotic ulnar nerve palsy having
undergone lumbrical replacement with two different tendon transfer techniques
were assessed 6-120 months after surgery. Nineteen patients were reconstructed
with the flexor digitorum four-tail procedure (FDS-4T), and six with Zancolli's
lasso procedure (ZLP). Mean paralysis times were 103 months for FDS-4T, and 68
months for ZLP. Mean age of the patients was 36 years (21-57). Grip strength
measurements, improvement in active range of motion at the PIP joints, patients' 
ability to open and close their hands fully, as well as sequence of phalangeal
flexion, were noted. Mean grip strength measurements during follow-up were 76% of
the contralateral extremity in the FDS-4T group and 82% in the ZLP group.
Comparison of the follow-up grip strength with the preoperative value revealed 1%
improvement in the FDS-4T group and 20% in the ZLP group. Claw hand deformity was
completely corrected in 12 patients in FDS-4T group, and in five patients in the 
ZLP group. Residual flexion contracture remained in five patients after surgery. 
Swan-neck deformity subsequently developed in seven fingers. Age, sex, mean
follow-up and surgical technique did not relate statistically to the functional
outcome. However, preoperative extensor lag of the PIP joint and mean paralysis
time significantly affected the functional outcome. ZLP was found to be a more
effective procedure in restoring grip strength, whereas FDS-4T was more effective
in correcting claw hand deformity.

The number of reports on the effects induced by electromagnetic radiation (EMR)
from cellular telephones in various cellular systems is still increasing. Until
now, no satisfactory mechanism has been proposed to explain the biological
effects of this radiation except a role suggested for mast cells. Merkel cells
may also play a role in the mechanisms of biological effects of EMR. This study
was undertaken to investigate the influence of EMR from a cellular telephone (900
MHz) on Merkel cells in rats. A group of rats was exposed to a cellular telephone
in speech position for 30 min. Another group of rats was sham-exposed under the
same environmental conditions for 30 min. Exposure led to significantly higher
exocytotic activity in Merkel cells compared with the sham exposure group. This
finding may indicate the possible role of Merkel cells in the pathophysiology of 
the effects of EMR.

CD44 and hyaluronate in the differential diagnosis of dermatofibroma and
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

Calikoglu E(1), Augsburger E, Chavaz P, Saurat JH, Kaya G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, Fatih University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.

The histological distinction between dermatofibroma (DF) and dermatofibrosarcoma 
protuberans (DFSP) may be extremely difficult. CD34 and Factor XIIIa have been
used to differentiate DF from DFSP. However, there is an overlap and relative
lack of specificity of their expressions. CD44 is a widely distributed integral
membrane glycoprotein, which is expressed as a multitude of isoforms generated by
alternative splicing of at least 10 different variant exons and
post-translational modifications. CD44 is currently thought to be the principal
cell surface receptor for hyaluronate (HA), the major component of the
extracellular matrix. In this study we aimed to assess the expression of standard
CD44 (CD44s) and its isoforms (CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7, CD44v7v8, 
and CD44v10), and HA in DF and DFSP. Immunohistochemical staining was performed
on the biopsy specimens of 15 cases of DF and four cases of DFSP, using
antibodies that recognize the CD44s, different CD44 isoforms and the hyaluronate 
binding protein (HABP). Tumor cells displayed a strong CD44s immunoreactivity in 
all cases of DF whereas a faint HA positivity was observed in the tumor stroma.
The DF cells were negative for CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v6, CD44v7 and CD44v7v8 but
showed a strong reactivity for CD44v5 and CD44v10. In contrast, CD44s' expression
was significantly reduced or absent in all DFSP lesions and the tumor stroma
displayed strong staining for HA. Our results indicate that CD44 and HA can be
used as additional diagnostic markers to distinguish DF from DFSP.

Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is a relatively new nosologic
entity. First described in 1988, it is now included in the "neuronal and mixed
neuronal-glial tumours" category in the revised 2000 World Health Organization
(WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Nervous System. The collective experience 
of more than 300 reported cases indicates that, with only rare exceptions, DNTs
are cerebral cortical lesions. At present, the actual incidence of extracortical 
DNT is unknown. We describe, the clinicopathologic features of the first tectal
DNT. The patient was a 51-year-old man with a 2-month history of pulsatile
headaches. On neurologic examination, the only abnormality was gait ataxia.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a midbrain tumor involving the
tectum. It was hypointense on T1-weighted images and featured an iso- to
hyperintense nodule at its center. The nodule showed enhancement upon contrast
administration. No aqueductal obstruction or intraventricular extension of tumor 
was detected. The tumor was approached supratentorially and removed completely.
The mucoid tumor was well demarcated from neural tissue. Histopathologically, it 
was a typical DNT, exhibiting a nodular pattern of growth with a "specific
glioneuronal component." This case report documents the first DNT to arise in the
midbrain tectum and focuses on the problem of diagnosing this uncommon tumor at
extracortical sites.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Pathology and Ophthalmology, University of Cukurova School of
Medicine, 01330, Adana, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Preoperative cytologic diagnoses of ocular surface squamous neoplasms 
were evaluated and compared with histologic diagnoses.
STUDY DESIGN: Impression cytology (Millipore filter paper) and brush cytology
were applied to 32 patients who had conjunctival neoplasms. Papanicolaou-stained 
cytologic preparations and hematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic sections were
examined by light microscopy.
RESULTS: The brush technique was used on 27 patients; impression cytology was
applied in 5 cases. Cytologic and histologic diagnoses were concordant in 26
cases. Squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ was diagnosed in 18 and
dysplasia in 4 cases. Squamous metaplasia and normal-appearing conjunctival
epithelial cells were diagnosed cytologically in four cases; of those histologic 
diagnoses, one was pterygium and three, conjunctival nevus. Four cases revealed
discrepancies between the cytologic and histologic preparations. There was one
false positive result, and one case was subconjunctival invasion of basal cell
carcinoma of the eyelid.
CONCLUSION: Impression and brush cytology are fast, cost-effective, reliable and 
noninvasive diagnostic tools for ocular surface squamous neoplasms. However, the 
brush technique has several advantages over impression cytology.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is an angiodestructive, angioinvasive
lymphoproliferative disorder. It involves most frequently lungs, central nervous 
system and skin. Recent studies indicate that lymphomatoid granulomatosis is an
Epstein-Barr virus associated B cell disorder with a background of reactive T
lymphocytes. In a 49 year old woman presenting with fever, malaise and pulmonary 
masses the diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis was established
histologically by open lung biopsy. Following the initial diagnosis the patient
was found to have gastric and skin involvement. The skin lesion was diagnosed as 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

In the gastrointestinal tract, carcinosarcomas are most frequently seen in the
esophagus. Carcinosarcoma in the stomach is a rare tumor. We report a
carcinosarcoma of the antrum of stomach. The tumor was polypoid and exophytic in 
appearance and located in the antrum. Immunohistochemical studies showed
positivity for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and cytoplasmic
carcinoembryonic antigen in the epithelial component. Positive staining with
vimentin, desmin and focal smooth muscle actin and negative staining with
chromogranin were observed in spindle cells. Nuclear positive staining was
observed with p53 and Ki-67 in both glandular and spindle atypical cells.

General features of gastric carcinomas and comparison of HSP70 and NK cell
immunoreactivity with prognostic factors.

Canöz O(1), Belenli O, Patiroglu TE.

Author information: 
(1)Pathology Department, Medical Faculty of Erciyes University, Kocasinan /
Kayseri, Turkey. ocanoz@erciyes.edu.tr

During the period of 1996-1998 ninety-four gastrectomy specimens with gastric
carcinoma referred to Erciyes University, Medical Faculty, Department of
Pathology, were examined histopathologically, histochemically and
immunohistochemically. General characteristics of gastric carcinomas and
prognostic factors were studied. According the Lauren classification, of the 94
cases of gastric carcinomas, 56 were intestinal type, 21 were diffuse type and 17
were mixed type carcinoma. The association rates of Helicobacter pylori, chronic 
atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia with gastric carcinomas were high.
There was strong immunorectivity with HSP70 in 62,5% of the intestinal type
carcinomas. This ratios were lower in diffuse and mixed type carcinomas (p<0.05).
The more tumor size and invasion depth increased, the more HSP70 immunoreactivity
was obtained (p<0.05). HSP70 immunorectivity was considerably higher in the
patients having lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion (p<0.05). It was
found that the NK cell number was low in the tumor but higher around the tumor in
early gastric carcinomas, compared with advanced carcinomas (p>0.05). In the
tumors larger than 10 cm with vascular invasion, NK cell number was lower around 
the tumor (p>0.05). Defining prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas is of
importance to clinicians. It is thought that HSP70 immunoreactivity, besides
invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, tumor size and
inflammatory reaction against the tumor, is important in prognosis and associated
with advanced stage.

A mediastinal mass was found in a 37 year old male who presented with fever,
weight loss and fatigue. The chest CT revealed a 9x6x4 cm well circumscribed mass
located paratrachaelly in the upper mid-mediastinum. The mass was removed by
right thoracotomy. Macroscopically the tumor weighed 195 g and measured 9x6x4 cm.
Microscopically the tumor consisted of small blue cells in solid and trabecular
pattern. Immunohistochemical studies performed for differential diagnosis of
small blue cell tumors. The tumor was diagnosed as primary neuroendocrine
carcinoma of the mediastinum. This case is presented for its rare recurrence in
that particular location.

Specificity of MOC-31 and HBME-1 immunohistochemistry in the differential
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma: a study on environmental 
malignant mesothelioma cases from Turkish villages.

Histological diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma (MM) and differentiation from
adenocarcinoma is often difficult. A number of clinical, radiologic, histologic
and histochemical criteria have been used as diagnostic aids, but most cases
cannot be readily classified on the basis of these characteristics. In recent
years, a panel of immunohistochemical anti-bodies have been increasingly applied 
for the differential diagnosis of these two tumors. MOC-31 has been recently used
as specific for adenocarcinomas while reacting with a minimal number of benign
and malignant mesothelial proliferations, and HBME-1 has also been presented as a
mesothelial cell marker. In this study, we aimed to show the importance of these 
two antibodies among the environmental MM cases from Southeastern Turkey. Fifty
five cases of MM and twenty adenocarcinomas were included in this study.
Histochemical (PAS, PAS-D, mucicarmine) and immunohistochemical (Keratin,
EMA,CEA, MOC-31, HBME-1) stains have been performed on each case. Keratin was
positive in all cases. EMA stained 50 of 55 MM and all the adenocarcinoma cases. 
According to our results, dPAS, mucicarmen, CEA and MOC-31 positivity was
statistically significant in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma whereas HBME-1 was
demonstrable in most MM cases (52/55) and 11 adenocarcinoma cases. This study
confirmed that in the diagnostic distinction between MM and adenocarcinoma,
immuno-histochemistry is an important diagnostic tool, however, a panel of
antibodies must be used rather than any single antibody. HBME-1 should be
included in this panel; MOC-31 can be used where CEA is not available or to
doublecheck the reactivity of this antibody.

Clinicopathologic evaluation of CDw75 antigen expression in colorectal
adenocarcinomas.

Turkey. elpek@med.akdeniz.edu.tr

CDw75, a B lymphocyte surface antigen, is a sialylated carbohydrate epitope,
which is generated by the enzyme beta galactosyl alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase
(Sia-T1). In colon carcinomas, although higher levels of Sia-T1 has been
described and found to be correlated with metastatic potential of tumor cells,
the expression of CDw75 antigen still remains unknown. To address this issue, we 
investigated immunohistochemically CDw75 antigen expression in 195 colorectal
adenocarcinomas and their nodal metastases. The correlation between CDw75 antigen
expression with selected clinicopathologic variables was analyzed by using
Chi-square and Fisher s exact tests. Positive staining was observed in 101 cases.
Non-neoplastic mucosa was negative consistently. The frequency of positivity was 
decreased according to the degree of differentiation (p<0.001). Antigen
expression was found to be associated with deeper penetration (p<0.006), positive
lymph nodes (p<0.001), distant metastases (p<0.006) and advanced stage (p<0.001).
Same relationships were detected in well and moderately differentiated tumors
when CDw75 immunoreactivity was evaluated in each histologic grade separately.
Our findings indicate that CDw75 antigen expression may be a good indicator of
the biological aggressiveness of colorectal adenocarcinomas especially in tumors 
with well and moderately differentiated morphology.

Author information: 
(1)Dokuz Eylül University, School of Medicine, Department of Pathology,
Inciralti-Izmir, Turkey. ugur.pabuccuoglu@deu.edu.tr

Candidiasis of the larynx is rare, and candidal involvement of the larynx mostly 
occurs after pulmonary, pharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, or as part of
disseminated disease. We here report our morphologic observations made in five
cases of laryngeal candidiasis. These cases had the following morphologic
features in common: 1. pronounced epithelial hyperplasia, which may show a
verrucous pattern, 2. prominent ortho-parakeratosis, and 3. predominantly
neutrophilic infiltration located in the upper layers of the mucosal epithelium. 
Our morphologic observations were similar to the morphologic changes encountered 
in chronic hyperplastic candidosis of the oral mucosa. As this type of candidal
lesions contains fewer hyphae than the usual thrush, fungal infection may be
easily overlooked. Pronounced epithelial hyperplasia and prominent
ortho-parakeratosis may mimic squamous cell and verrucous carcinomas. In
conclusion, we suggest performing special stains for fungi of laryngeal biopsies 
that have the morphologic features mentioned above. In that way, it is possible
to detect a candidal infection, keeping in mind that the fungal organisms may be 
very few in number and morphologically distorted.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MUC1 and MUC2
mucin expressions and clinicopathologic variables in gastric carcinomas with
regard to survival times. MUC1 and MUC2 expressions were revealed
immunohistochemically in 143 gastric carcinomas. Of these 143 patients, follow-up
data were available for 45 (median survival time of 30 months, ranging from 2 to 
80 months). MUC1 was detected in 82 (58%), and MUC2 in 60 (42%) out of 143 cases.
Papillary adenocarcinomas showed significantly higher MUC1 and MUC2
immunoreactivity than did signet-ring cell and mucinous tumors (p = 0.045 and p =
0.01, respectively). MUC1 was highly positive in intestinal-type carcinomas (p = 
0.006), whereas intestinal and diffuse carcinomas did not differ in MUC2
expression. There was a positive correlation between tumor differentiation and
MUC1 expression. However, no correlation was found between MUC1 and MUC2
expressions and angiolymphatic invasion. According to the TNM classification,
stage 1A tumors have significantly lower rates of MUC1 reactivity compared to
higher stages (p = 0.04). The patients with gastric carcinomas expressing MUC1
showed significantly poorer survival than those without MUC1 expression (p =
0.04). The present study suggests that MUC1 expression be a useful prognostic
factor for predicting the outcome of gastric carcinoma patients, whereas the role
of MUC2 expression is still unclear.

The prognostic value of nuclear grading and the revised FIGO grading of
endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Ayhan A(1), Taskiran C, Yuce K, Kucukali T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hacettepe University Hospitals,
Ankara, Turkey.

The purpose of this study was to determine a convenient method for the
modification of architectural grade by nuclear features and to evaluate the
prognostic significance of the new International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) grading system by studying 288 patients with endometrioid
endometrial carcinoma. All patients were subjected to initial surgical
exploration and staging by 1988 FIGO guidelines. Three different grading systems 
were evaluated for their prognostic value: architectural, nuclear, and FIGO
combined systems. All three grading systems significantly predicted poor
survival, but only the FIGO grade (p < 0.001), stage (p < 0.001), and cervical
involvement (p = 0.04) remained significant in multivariate analysis. In the
architectural grade 2 group, the 5-year survival rate for 39 patients with grade 
1 or 2 nuclei was 87%, compared with 66% for 35 patients with grade 3 nuclei (p =
0.03). In the architectural grade 1 group, the 5-year survival rate for 84
patients with grade 2 nuclei was 93% without significant difference from the
original group (96%). FIGO grade 3 tumor predicted 70% of deaths (29/41), whereas
architectural grade 3 tumor detected 41% (17/41) of deaths (p = 0.001). In
conclusion, in determining the FIGO grade, upgrading of architectural grade 1 or 
2 tumors by grade 3 nuclei was the most reliable method. The new FIGO grading
system was prognostically superior to the previously used architectural grading
system.

Effects of methimazole pretreatment on cerulein induced acute pancreatitis in
rats.

Yönetçi N(1), Oruç N, Ozütemiz AO, Kumanlioglu K, Yüce G, Batur Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gastroenterology, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Many interrelationships exist between the thyroid gland and the
gastrointestinal tract. Several past and recent studies have shown that the
thyroid gland profoundly influences the structure and function of the exocrine
pancreas in the rat. In the present study we investigated the effect of
methimazole (METZ), an antithyroid drug, on cerulein induced acute pancreatitis
(AP) in rats.
METHODS: Rats were divided into 3 groups (10-12 weeks age, 200-250 g weight, n:
10). Group B was made hypothyroid with methimazole 5 mg/kg daily for 10 days and 
the others were untreated euthyroid groups. After 10 days, acute pancreatitis was
induced with four doses of 20 microg/kg body weight of cerulein administered s.c 
at hourly intervals in group A and B while the control group C was given 4 doses 
of I ml saline. Pancreas wet weight (mg), plasma amylase activity (IU/l) and
pancreatic histology were used as endpoints to quantify the severity of the AP.
RESULTS: Plasma tri-iodothyronine (T3) (ng/dl) and thyroxine (T4) (microg/dl)
levels were significantly reduced after METZ treatment for 10 days (p < 0.01).
METZ pretreatment reduced significantly the cerulein induced increase in
pancreatic weight (1,205 +/- 12 mg in METZ treated AP group versus 1,617 +/- 14
mg in AP group, p < 0.05) and the rise in amylase activity (7,078 +/- 816 IU/l in
METZ treated AP group versus 8,611 +/- 830 IU/l in AP group p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: METZ reduces the severity of cerulein induced AP in rats. This effect
might be through its antithyroid property.

We report the rare case of a 43-year-old woman with a simultaneous meningioma of 
the sphenoid wing and an amyloid-containing prolactinoma. The patient, who
presented with a 17-year history of amenorrhea, and galactorrhea, was found to
have a 10-mm mass in the pituitary gland. During excision of this lesion, another
mass was noticed, which was located in the sphenoid wing. Both lesions were
completely excised. Histopathological examination revealed that the pituitary
tumor was a prolactinoma with diffuse amyloid deposition and that the second
tumor was a typical meningioma. The coexistence of a prolactinoma containing
amyloid and a meningioma is very rare in the literature, so this case is
presented here with its histochemical and immunohistochemical features. We
discuss the significance of prolactinoma containing amyloid and the simultaneous 
presentation of these two tumors.

Diagnostic utility of cytokeratin 19 expression in multinodular goiter with
papillary areas and papillary carcinoma of thyroid.

Erkiliç S(1), Aydin A, Koçer NE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep,
Turkey. serk52@yahoo.com

The most common benign lesion of thyroid, multinodular goiter, may mimic
papillary carcinoma if it contains papillary areas. Although it is usually not
very difficult to distinguish between these benign and malignant lesions, some
cases may be problematic in differential diagnosis. In these cases, we decided to
use cytokeratin 19 (CK19), which is shown to be effective in discriminating
papillary carcinoma from follicular carcinoma of thyroid, and we also evaluated
the immunoreactivity of CK19 in follicular adenomas. Twenty-five cases of
multinodular goiter showing papillary formations, 25 cases of papillary thyroid
carcinoma, and 15 cases of follicular adenoma were selected from archives of our 
institution. Immunohistochemical staining for CK19 was performed on
deparaffinized sections. Diffuse and intense CK19 positivity was found in the
cells of all papillary carcinomas. In the multinodular goiter group, 20 of 25
cases showed no staining while the remaining 5 were focally reactive with CK19.
Three of the five were thought to be false positive owing to hemorrhage. Weak and
focal CK19 staining was seen in some follicular adenomas. Our observations
suggest that the staining features of CK19 may be helpful in differential
diagnosis between papillary carcinoma and multinodular goiter showing papillary
areas. Focal and pale staining for CK19 may be seen in multinodular goiter with
papillary formations, and this feature should be considered in evaluation.

Distribution of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the cerebellum in canine
distemper virus infection.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of
Kirikkale, 71450 Yahsihan, Kirikkale, Turkey.

The cerebella of eight dogs naturally infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) 
and two normal dogs were examined immunohistochemically for glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). The
clinical diagnosis of canine distemper was confirmed histopathologically and by
the immunohistochemical demonstration of CDV antigen. In all dogs (healthy and
infected), the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were immunolabelled for 3beta-HSD
activity. In infected dogs, 3beta-HSD labelling was prominent in astrocytes
(particularly in areas of astrocytosis) whereas in healthy dogs such
immunolabelling was weak. Double immunolabelling demonstrated that all
GFAP-positive cells (especially in demyelinating areas) were also positive for
3beta-HSD. The results suggest that 3beta-HSD expression by astrocytes is
associated with demyelination in CDV infection.

drakyurek@hotmail.com

AIMS: Expression of nm23 has been identified as a potential metastatic
suppressor. In this study, nm23-H1 expression, clinicopathological parameters and
influences on clinical outcomes were investigated in colorectal carcinoma
patients.
METHODS: Immunostaining was performed on 185 colorectal carcinomas using a
polyclonal anti-nm23-H1 antibody.
RESULTS: The nm23-H1 immunoreactivity was weak in 31 (17%), moderate in 48 (26%) 
and strong in 106 (57%) cases. The well differentiated adenocarcinomas showed
significantly strong staining for nm23-H1 compared with the moderately and poorly
differentiated adenocarcinomas (chi2 test, P<0.001). Advanced tumour stages were 
associated with reduced nm23-H1 expression (P<0.001). There was an inverse
correlation with angiolymphatic invasion, nodal metastasis and liver metastasis
(univariate logistic regression analysis, P<0.001). In univariate analysis,
patients with reduced expression of nm23-H1 had significantly shorter overall and
disease-free survival than the strong expression group (log-rank test for trend, 
P=0.002 and P=0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that reduced nm23-H1 expression showed poor
prognosis in colorectal carcinomas. As a result, nm23-H1 expression might be a
useful marker to predict outcome while planning treatment.

Breast cancer in a young person is considered a rare and very aggressive disease.
The theories addressing the underlying genetic mechanisms of this disease are
controversial. Therefore, additional genetic concepts playing a possible role in 
its pathogenesis and prognosis must be investigated. Microsatellite instability
(MSI) characterized by a mutational process of insertions or deletions in
microsatellite repeats might constitute a sensitive indicator for genomic
instability in cancer. MSI has been described in a wide variety of tumors,
particularly in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. The reports regarding
its occurrence and prognostic significance in breast cancer are in conflict with 
each other. The purpose of this study was to investigate MSI in early-onset
breast cancer and to correlate its occurrence with clinicopathological
prognisticators. In this study, 16 female patients with primary breast cancer
under 35 years of age (range 29-34) were investigated for the incidence of MSI in
five microsatellite loci (D2S123, D3S1611, D17S807, D17S796 and Xq11-12) by
comparing paired normal and tumor tissue DNA after PCR amplification from
paraffin-embedded tissues. No instability was found in any of these five
microsatellite loci. Although care must be taken not to overstate the importance 
of this result due to the inadequate number of microsatellite markers and DNA
samples studied, this preliminary report indicates that MSI phenotype is uncommon
in human early-onset breast cancer. Therefore, it does not appear to be related
to the prognosis of disease.

Multinodular hydropic leiomyoma of the uterus with perinodular hydropic
degeneration and extrauterine extension.

Multinodular hydropic leiomyoma (MHL) of the uterus is one of the rarest variants
of uterine leiomyomas and can create some diagnostic problems. Only five cases
have been reported previously. We describe an MHL with perinodular hydropic
degeneration in a 48-year-old woman. Gross examination revealed a large and
predominantly intramural, edematous multinodular uterine tumor and extrauterine, 
small grape-like nodules overlying the lateral surface of the uterine serosa.
Histologically, the tumor was composed of extra-intrauterine benign, small smooth
muscle nodules with perinodular hydropic degeneration, prominent intramural
dissecting growth pattern, and satellite nodules closely resembling vascular
invasion. Immunohistochemically, these cells stained for desmin, smooth muscle
actin and vimentin. The patient had no evidence of disease for 18 months after
hysterectomy. Multinodular hydropic leiomyoma is a clinically benign tumor and
should not be confused with intravenous leiomyomatosis and some other unusual
leiomyoma variants.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast:
a report of five cases.

Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast is an uncommon variant of
infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Observing its distinctive cytologic appearance and
aggressive behavior is important for early diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration
cytology (FNAC). There are only a few reported cases in the literature. Five
women presented with breast masses. FNAC showed malignant epithelial tumors, and 
mastectomy materials showed invasive micropapillary carcinoma for all of them.
Three patients had axillary lymph node metastases. Invasive micropapillary
carcinoma, with its angulated papillary clusters lacking a fibrovascular core,
and irregular crowded nuclei, has a distinctive cytologic appearance which
correlates with its histological features. A differential diagnosis from other
primary or metastatic papillary lesions of the breast may be possible using
immunohistochemistry and some cytologic features. The limited experience with
invasive micropapillary carcinoma should not discourage others from undertaking
further studies.

Apoptosis-related proteins and steroid hormone receptors in normal, hyperplastic,
and neoplastic endometrium.

Bozdoğan O(1), Atasoy P, Erekul S, Bozdoğan N, Bayram M.

Author information: 
(1)Kirikkale University Faculty of Medicine, Kirikkale State Hospital, Turkey.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution and frequency of
apoptosis-related proteins and their correlation with estrogen, progesterone, and
androgen receptors in endometrial tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses of bcl-2,
bax, bcl-x, and steroid receptors were performed in 22 endometrial carcinomas, 26
endometrial hyperplasias, and 19 cases of normal cyclical endometrium. Bcl-2 was 
expressed in 45.4% of carcinomas and 92.3% of hyperplasias. Bax immunostaining
was found in 90.9% of carcinomas and 76.9% of hyperplasias. Bcl-x positivity was 
similar in carcinomas (68.1%) and endometrial hyperplasias (76.9%). In normal
cyclical endometria, bcl-2 staining was intense and diffuse in the proliferative 
phase, but decreased dramatically in the early and mid-secretory phase to
reappear in the late secretory phase. Bax was expressed throughout the menstrual 
cycle but more strongly in the secretory phase. Bcl-x displayed a similar degree 
of expression in proliferative and secretory endometria. Nineteen carcinomas
(86.3%), 25 hyperplasias (96.1%), and 18 normal cyclical endometria (94.7%) were 
positive for estrogen receptor (ER). Progesterone receptor (PR) was observed in
20 carcinomas (90.9%), all hyperplasias (100%), and 18 normal cyclical endometria
(94.7%). Androgen receptor (AR) positivity was seen in 7 carcinomas (31.8%), 6
hyperplasias (23.0%), and 3 normal cyclical endometria (15.7%). There was a
statistically positive correlation between bcl-x and ER and a tendency toward
significant correlation between bcl-x and PR and between ER and PR in carcinomas.
In hyperplasias, there was a significant positive correlation between bcl-2 and
PR and between bcl-2 and bax and a negative correlation between ER and bax. There
was a statistically significant difference for bcl-2 (p = 0.001) and bax (p =
0.001) between the hyperplasia and carcinoma groups. There was increased
expression of bax, decreased expression of bcl-2, and persistence of bcl-x
protein in advanced endometrial carcinomas. Our findings show that ovarian
hormones have a regulatory role on bcl-2 protein and that there is a correlation 
between other members of the bcl-2 family (bcl-x and bax) and steroid hormone
receptors. Bax/bcl-x may be the major control mechanisms of apoptosis in advanced
carcinomas; other members of the bcl-2 family may also be under hormonal control.

Protective role of melatonin and a combination of vitamin C and vitamin E on lung
toxicity induced by chlorpyrifos-ethyl in rats.

Isparta, Turkey.

The ameliorating effects of melatonin and vitamin C plus vitamin E were examined 
histologically and biochemically in lung tissues in rats exposed to
chlorpyriphos-ethyl (CE). Experimental groups were as follows: Control group (C),
CE treated group (CE), vitamin C plus vitamin E treated group (Vit), melatonin
treated group (Mel), vitamin C plus vitamin E plus CE treated group (Vit + CE),
and melatonin plus CE treated group (Mel + CE). Vitamin E and vitamin C were
administered intramuscularly at the rates of 150 and 200 mg per kg body weight,
respectively, in Vit and Vit + CE groups, once a day for 6 consecutive days.
Melatonin was administered intramuscularly at the rate of 10 mg per kg body
weight in Mel and Mel + CE groups, once a day for 6 consecutive days. At the end 
of the fifth day, the rats of CE, Vit + CE and Mel + CE groups were treated
orally with CE dissolved in corn oil with two equal doses of 41 mg CE per kg body
weight at zero and twenty-first hours. Tissue samples of lungs were taken by
using appropriate techniques for biochemical and histological examinations under 
anesthesia at the twenty-fourth hours of CE administration, at the end of the
sixth day of the experiment. In tissue homogenates, the level of thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidant potential (AOP), and the activities
of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT)
were determined. TBARS was significantly high (p < 0.05) in CE group compared to 
control group, while TBARS was found to significantly decrease (p < 0.05) with
Vit and Mel groups compared to control. On the other hand, TBARS was seen to
significantly decrease (p < 0.05) in both groups of Vit + CE and Mel + CE
compared to CE group. In comparison with CE group, SOD activity was significantly
high (p < 0.05) with the groups of Vit, Mel, Vit + CE and Mel + CE. GSH-Px
activity was found to significantly decrease (p < 0.05) with CE group, compared
with both C and Vit groups. AOP was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in CE group
than C group. Although there was an increased AOP with Vit + CE and Mel + CE
groups compared to CE group, the increase in AOP was only seen to be significant 
(p < 0.05) in Mel + CE group. In comparison with C group, AOP significantly (p < 
0.05) increased with Vit group. There was also a significant (p < 0.05) increase 
in AOP with Mel + CE group, compared with CE group. Additionally, AOP was
significantly lower (p < 0.05) in Vit + CE group than Mel + CE group. Lungs were 
examined histologically at the end of sixth day. There were remarkable changes in
the histomorphology of peribronchial and perivascular area in the lung of rats
treated with CE. These were infiltration of mononuclear cells (such as
lymphocytes, plasmocytes, macrophages), hyperplasia of type II pneumocyte, and
thickened and increased connective tissue. Damage to the lung tissue such as
increased inflammatory mononuclear cells in peribronchial and perivascular areas 
were more pronounced for the CE group than Vit + CE and Mel + CE groups in which 
these changes were higher than C, Vit and Mel groups. These results suggest that 
CE increases lipid peroxidation and decreases antioxidant enzymes activities and 
AOP due to increasing oxidative stress induced by CE, and high doses of vitamin C
plus vitamin E and melatonin considerably reduce CE toxicity in lung tissues of
rats.

Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the breast is a rare, newly recognized
subtype of breast carcinoma. Distinction from medullary carcinoma is important
because of the difference in biologic behavior of these two neoplasms and LELC of
the breast is regarded as an unusual form of lobular carcinoma. We present the
case of a 56-year-old female with a breast mass measuring 2 cm in diameter, which
was diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma with LELC pattern. This is the ninth 
case reported in the English literature and to the best of our knowledge the
first one with lymph node metastasis.

Malignant struma ovarii is a rare form of ovarian germ cell tumors. Because of
its rarity, diagnosis and management of the tumor has not been clearly defined. A
52-year-old female with follicular variant of papillary carcinoma arising in
struma ovarii is presented. There was no evidence of clinical malignancy or
metastases. However on the basis of histopathologic findings, the case was
diagnosed as malignant struma ovarii. It was accepted as stage Ia tumor and no
other treatment was considered after radical excision. Due to its fairly good
prognosis, surgical excision has been the preferred treatment for those who do
not have disseminated disease. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up is necessary to 
determine the course of the disease.

Multiple somatic and inherited genetic changes that lead to loss of growth
control may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Microsatellites are
tandem repeats of simple sequences that occur abundantly and at random throughout
most eucaryotic genomes. Microsatellite instability (MI), characterized by the
presence of random contractions or expansions in the length of simple sequence
repeats or microsatellites, is observed in a variety of tumors. The aim of this
study was to compare tumor DNA fingerprints with constitutional DNA fingerprints 
to investigate changes specific to breast cancer and evaluate its correlation
with clinical characteristics. Tumor and normal tissue samples of 38 patients
with breast cancer were investigated by comparing PCR-amplified microsatellite
sequences D2S443 and D21S1436. Microsatellite instability at D21S1436 and D2S443 
was found in 5 (13%) and 7 (18%) patients, respectively. Two patients displayed
instability at both marker loci. No association was found between MI and age,
family history, lymph node involvement and other clinical parameters.

Overexpression and alterations in the glycosylation of gastric mucins have been
described in colorectal carcinoma. The purpose of our study was to confirm
aberrant expression of MUC5AC in colorectal carcinoma, to investigate
relationships between clinicopathological parameters and MUC5AC expression, and
to determine if MUC5AC expression may be a prognostic factor for colorectal
carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining using an antibody against MUC5AC tandem
repeat epitopes was performed on colorectal tumor specimens (n = 41), their
metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes (n = 21) and normal colonic mucosa (n =
41). We also documented clinicopathological parameters such as the age and sex of
the patient, location, size, Dukes stage, histological type and grade of the
tumor, pre-sence and number of metastatic lymph nodes, lymphatic, venous and
perineural invasion, presence of preoperative and postoperative metastatic tumors
and tumor recurrence. MUC5AC was expressed in 34.1% of tumor samples, 24.4% of
normal colonic mucosa samples and 19% of lymph node metastases. MUC5AC showed
ectopic expression in colorectal carcinoma and was also expressed strongly in
mucinous carcinoma (60%). The number of tumors that expressed MUC5AC was lower in
patients older than 60 years, in rectum-localized tumors and in patients who had 
evidence of recurrence and/or metastasis in the postoperative period. The
patients with MUC5AC-negative tumors had a lower incidence of being disease free 
and of overall survival. In conclusion, the patients with MUC5AC-negative tumors 
had poor clinicopathological parameters and showed worse survival than patients
with MUC5AC-positive tumors. Absence of MUC5AC expression in tumors can be a
prognostic factor for more aggressive colorectal carcinoma.

Impact of p53 and Ki-67 in predicting recurrence and progression of superficial
(pTa and pT1) urothelial cell carcinomas of urinary bladder.

Istanbul, Turkey.

In predicting the aggressive behavior of bladder tumors, the histopathological
characteristics of grade and invasive stage are of principal importance. However,
for predicting tumor recurrence and progression, these are sufficient only to a
limited extent, particularly in the case of superficial (pTa and pT1) urothelial 
cell carcinomas. New prognostic factors are therefore needed to avoid either
insufficient or excessive treatment. In this retrospective study, we investigated
the prognostic value of the p53 and Ki-67 immunoreactivity indices. The present
study included 118 superficial urinary bladder tumors consisting of 58 recurrent 
and 60 non-recurrent cases. Twenty of the recurrent tumors progressed into a
higher grade and/or invasive stage. Paraffin immunohistochemical analysis was
carried out using anti-p53 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies on the initial tumor
tissues. We concluded that there is a highly significant relationship between the
p53 and Ki-67 immunoreactivities and the histological grade and pathological
stage of the tumors (P < 0.0001). We observed a significant relationship between 
the presence of recurrence and progression and the p53 immunoreactivity index (P 
< 0.01 and P = 0.017, respectively) and Ki-67 immunoreactivity index (P < 0.0001 
and P = 0.046, respectively). Positivity for p53 and Ki-67 can demonstrate the
risk of recurrence (p53: sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 58%; Ki-67: sensitivity
= 86%, specificity = 48%) and progression (p53: sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 
46%; Ki-67: sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 36%; ). We believe that both of
these immunohistochemical markers can be considered valuable in addition to
classical histopathological prognostic parameters for predicting recurrence and
progression risks.

Kocaeli, Turkey. Erkacar@sisecam.com.tr

Papillary variant of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT) is an unusual
histologic pattern with some diagnostic difficulties. A case of encapsulated
papillary variant of MCT with extensive cystic appearance is reported. A
euthyroid, 43-yr-old woman with bone pain was incidentally found to have a 4.0-cm
solitary, cold nodule on her left thyroid lobe. Histopathologic examination
revealed an encapsulated tumor composed of a large cystic cavity with small
papillary projections. The papillae were lined by multiple layers of neoplastic
cells with small and regular nuclei containing condensed chromatin and lacking
the characteristic "ground glass" appearance of the papillary carcinoma of the
thyroid gland. Immunohistochemical studies revealed specific cytoplasmic staining
of the tumor cells for calcitonin, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase,
carcinoembryogenic antigen, and cytokeratin. Specific staining for thyroglobulin 
was not observed in any neoplastic cell. Staining with Congo red disclosed
amyloid deposits within the stroma. The case was diagnosed as papillary variant
of MCT. Medullary thyroid carcinomas may show a papillary pattern with a totally 
cystic gross appearance. Thyroid carcinomas should be classified according to
their major immunoreactivity pattern rather than their morphologic pattern.
Immunohistochemical and/or histochemical studies should be performed in all
thyroid tumors that show unusual histologic features.

Iron deficiency and smoking. Comparative criteria for buccal mucosa
keratinization in menstruating and postmenopausal women.

Artvinli LB(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oral Diagnosis and Radiology, Hacettepe University Faculty of
Dentistry, 06100 Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the degree of keratinization of buccal mucosa between
nonsmoking menstruating and postmenopausal women without oral complaints whose
iron status was established.
STUDY DESIGN: Samples collected from 26 nonsmoking, regularly menstruating women 
(mean age, 26 years) and 18 nonsmoking, postmenopausal women without oral
complaints (mean age, 57 years) were stained according to the method of
Papanicolaou. Keratinization was evaluated by the karyopyknotic index (KI). Iron 
status was assessed with blood ferritin levels.
RESULTS: Mean ferritin values of menstruating and postmenopausal women were
statistically significantly different (mean ferritin value = 28.97 micrograms/L
and 103.69 micrograms/L, respectively). The difference in the degree of
keratinization of buccal mucosa between menstruating women (mean KI = 16.03%) and
postmenopausal women (mean KI = 13.16) was statistically nonsignificant.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the degree of keratinization of buccal
mucosa does not show any alteration after menopause.

Author information: 
(1)Akdeniz University, Faculty of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and
Metabolism, Antalya, Turkey.

We report here a 48-yr-old woman presenting with a solitary thyroid nodule in the
left lobe of the thyroid. The aspiration cytology of the nodule was reported as
follicular neoplasia and she underwent surgery. Frozen section was suspicious for
medullary thyroid carcinoma and a total thyroidectomy was performed. The
pathology report revealed medullary thyroid carcinoma, follicular variant.
Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for thyroglobulin and positive for
calcitonin. A few patients with this variant have been reported in the
literature, mainly diagnosed by immunohistochemical features of the tumor. In
light of the limited information we have obtained from the literature, it is
reasonable to emphasize that these cases should be distinguished from the mixed
medullary- follicular thyroid carcinomas and medullary carcinomas with entrapped 
follicles. Immunohistochemical examination with calcitonin and thyroglobulin is
also essential.

Expression of E-cadherin in prostate cancer in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
tissues: correlation with pathological features.

Köksal IT(1), Ozcan F, Kiliçaslan I, Tefekli A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University,
Turkey. koksal@med.akdeniz.edu.tr

AIMS: E-cadherin has been studied recently as a potential marker for tumour
progression. The present study aimed to assess the expression of E-cadherin in
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded radical prostatectomy specimens and to
compare its expression with the pathological stage and Gleason score.
METHODS: This study comprised a total of 58 men who were selected on the basis of
the negative surgical margins of surgical specimens from radical retropubic
prostatectomies and concomitant pelvic lymph node dissections. Indirect
immunoperoxidase staining was performed as described previously using HECD-1
monoclonal antibody with the retrieval of antigen by treatment of the
paraffin-embedded tissue with microwaves in citrate buffer.
RESULTS: Aberrant staining patterns of E-cadherin were observed in 18 (64%) and
in 25 (83%) of cases with pathological stages pT2 and pT3a, respectively
(P>0.05). Immunohistochemical examination also revealed aberrant staining
patterns of E-cadherin in 16 (89%) of specimens with Gleason score > or =7 and in
27 (68%) of specimens with Gleason score <7 (P>0.05). Biochemical recurrence was 
identified in three (5%) patients and immunohistochemical examination of their
specimens revealed aberrant staining patterns of E-cadherin molecule in all of
them.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that, even though we could not
demonstrate any significant correlation between E-cadherin staining pattern and
tumour invasion and Gleason scores, aberrant staining patterns of E-cadherin may 
be a significant predictor for disease recurrence following radical
prostatectomies if supported by large scale studies.

We attempted to determine Bcl-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), p53 and 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, and the relationships
between them, in endometrioid adenocarcinomas and precursor lesions. Expression
of Bcl-2, iNOS, p53 and PCNA were investigated immunohistochemically in 91
samples from benign (proliferative (pEM), secretory (sEM), disordered
proliferative (dEM), inactive/atrophic (aEM), hyperplastic endometrium) and
malignant endometrial tissue. Staining scores for Bcl-2 in the dEM, endometrial
hyperplasia (EMH) and endometrioid cancer (ECA) groups were higher than in the
pEM group (P = 0.004; P = 0.036 and P = 0.020, respectively). A significant
difference in proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining was found between
simple and complex EMH samples (P = 0.000). An inverse relationship was found
between iNOS and p53 in the hyperplasia group (r = -0.533, P = 0.019). While a
significant difference was found in p53 staining in ECA between the pEM, dEM and 
EMH groups, no such difference was found in iNOS staining. In addition, there was
no direct relationship between iNOS and p53 in the ECA group. It was concluded
that the interaction between iNOS, p53 and Bcl-2 in proliferative processes in
the development of type 1 endometrioid adenocarcinomas is different from that in

Microbiology, Ankara, Turkey.

Candida dubliniensis is one of the Candida species which was first recognized in 
1995. The yeast was misidentified because of its phenotypic similarities with
Candida albicans. In this study, blood samples of patients from various
departments at Ankara University Medical Faculty between January 1996 and
September 2000 were investigated for distribution of Candida spp. and presence of
C. dubliniensis. Ninety-eight culture positive fungi were included in the study. 
Phenotypic tests for identification of C. dubliniensis and tests for
differentiation of the yeast from C. albicans, such as colony morphology on Staib
agar, growth at 42 degrees C and 45 degrees C, beta-glucosidase activity and
carbohydrate assimilation, were carried out. Sixty-four of the isolates produced 
germ tubes and chlamydospores, and none of them had the phenotypic
characteristics of C. dubliniensis. Further large-scale studies of specific
patient groups are necessary to reveal the etiologic importance of this yeast.

Methyl methacrylate (MMA) is a monomer, commonly used in neurosurgery, orthopedic
surgery, and in dental clinics. The adverse effects of this monomer are well
described in the literature. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of
MMA on nasal cavity, lung, and antioxidant status. For this purpose, two
experimental groups of rats were exposed to MMA (at 1,000 ppm, 6 h/day, 5
days/week for 4 weeks) by inhalation under poor (group A, n = 12) and normal
ventilation (group B, n = 11) conditions. A control group (group C, n = 10)
received normal air. Degeneration of olfactory epithelium, bronchopneumonia,
interstitial pneumonia, hemorrhage, atelectasis, edema, emphysema, and bronchial 
epithelial hyperplasia were observed in groups A and B. Emphysema was the most
common lesion. Bronchopneumonia with abscesses was only observed in group A.
Glutathione levels were significantly decreased and malondialdehyde levels were
significantly increased in group A. No significant difference was observed in
superoxide dismutase levels between the groups. The data presented indicate that 
before using MMA, adequate protection systems should be in place to prevent
occupationally related MMA respiratory-tract injuries.

Immunohistological analysis of mast cell numbers in the intratumoral and
peritumoral regions of prostate carcinoma compared to benign prostatic
hyperplasia.

Turkey. ozlemaydin66@hotmail.com

Recently, some studies reported the presence of mast cells in various
malignancies and their role in tumor growth. The aim of the study was to
determine the utility of mast cell numbers in evaluating benign and malignant
prostate lesions, and to ascertain whether there are variations in the numbers of
mast cells with the Gleason grade. The relationship between mast cell numbers and
patient age was also investigated. Retrospectively, 104 prostate specimens were
examined for the presence of mast cells. The study group consisted of 57 benign
prostatic hyperplasias and 47 prostate carcinomas. The paraffin sections were
stained with anti-human mast cell tryptase immunohistologically. The numbers of
positively staining cells in five high-power fields were counted, and their mean 
was calculated. There was no relationship found between mast cell numbers and age
statistically. The mean mast cell numbers of the intratumoral region were
significantly different from those of the peritumoral region (p = 0.0001). While 
the difference between benign hyperplasia and the intratumoral region was found
to be significant (p = 0.0001), no difference between hyperplasia and the
peritumoral region was noted (p = 0.762). There was no statistical difference
between Gleason score groups (p = 0.452), and there was no interaction between
score groups and intraperitumoral regions (p = 0.355).

The gray zone in breast fine needle aspiration cytology. How to report on it?

Ozkara SK(1), Ustün MO, Paksoy N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kocaeli, Izmit,
Kocaeli, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To study the "gray zone" in breast fine needle aspiration cytology in 
which an unequivocal diagnosis cannot be reached with fine needle aspiration
cytology findings.
STUDY DESIGN: This study compared cytology and histopathology of 72 breast
lesions in which an initial cytologic diagnosis of atypia was given.
RESULTS: There were 36 benign (50%) and 36 malignant (50%) histologic biopsy
cases in the cytologic atypia group. Anisonucleosis, chromatin and nuclear
membrane irregularity, and presence of myoepithelial cells were significantly
different in benign and malignant cases.
CONCLUSION: The gray zone in breast fine needle aspiration cytology is a broad
spectrum that changes from proliferative fibrocystic disease to sclerosing
adenosis to malignancy. Diagnosing gray zone pathology as atypical in fine needle
aspiration cytology causes no delay in treatment as excisional biopsy is
recommended for all equivocal cases.

A 25-year-old man presented with complaint of a painless enlargement in his left 
testis. The solid, encapsulated, circumscribed and grayish-white testicular mass 
displayed the characteristics of testicular fibroma histologically. It was
composed of acellular collagenized plaques and hypercellular areas of
fibroblastic spindle cells. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were
positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin, but not for cytokeratin, S-100
protein, desmin, CD99/MIC2 (a protein expressed by Sertoli cells and granulosa
cells) and CD34. Only 18 cases of testicular (gonadal stromal) fibroma composed
exclusively of spindle cells have been reported to date. An additional case of
fibroma, which lacks definite neoplastic sex cord elements, and its differential 
diagnosis from other mesenchymal lesions of testis are discussed here, together
with other cases in the literature.

Mixed apocrine sweat gland tumor of the tail in a cow.

Gulbahar MY(1), Alkan I, Aslan L, Golen I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Yuzuncu
Yil, Zeve Kampusu, Turkey.

A 4-year-old native-breed cow had a mass with wide areas of ulceration and
hemorrhage at the base of the tail at the same level as the vulva. The tumor was 
19 X 13 X 11 cm, appeared red-brown, and was firm to hard, with gritty areas
apparent on cut surface. Histologically, the tumor mass was composed of
multilayered epithelial cells forming glandular structures with occasional apical
blebs and rare solidly packed cells in nests. The stroma included fibrous
connective tissue, scattered or periglandular sheets of spindle-shaped cells
resembling myoepithelium, several cartilaginous formations, and numerous
irregular islands of mineralized osteoid, well-formed bone trabeculae lined by
osteoblasts, and many osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells among or near
the neoplastic epithelium. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic epithelium was
positive for pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE2) and cytokeratin 19 but was negative for
cytokeratin 18. Spindle-shaped cells were stained with alpha smooth muscle actin 
(alphaSMA) and to a lesser extent vimentin antibodies. The cells of osteogenic
lineage and spindle cells closely associated with the osteoid showed strong
immunostaining for vimentin but not for alphaSMA. Immunostaining for
neuron-specific enolase and S100 protein was not observed in any component of the
tumor mass. These findings suggested that the origin of bone formation was
undifferentiated mesenchymal cells with osteogenic potential.

Histologic features of the liver in type Ia glycogen storage disease: comparative
study between different age groups and consecutive biopsies.

Göğüş S(1), Koçak N, Ciliv G, Karabulut E, Akçören Z, Kale G, Cağlar M.

Author information: 
(1)Pediatric Pathology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University
School of Medicine, 06100 Ankara, Turkey.

In this report, the histologic criteria for the diagnosis of type Ia glycogen
storage disease (GSD) in a wide age range were studied. Liver needle biopsies of 
44 patients with type Ia GSD confirmed by enzyme analysis were re-evaluated and
compared. Fatty change, nuclear hyperglycogenation (NH), and fibrosis were
examined and graded. The second biopsies of 14 patients were also evaluated and
compared with the first ones. The patients were grouped according to age: group
I: <1 year (18 cases), group II: 1-5 years (19 cases), group III: >5 years (7
cases). A mosaic pattern was detected in all biopsies. The amount of fibrosis in 
group I was less than that in the other two groups. The fatty change in group I
was more prominent. There was not much difference in the amount of NH between age
groups. In comparing the two different biopsies of 14 patients, the amount of
fibrosis was found to be increased in 7 cases. NH was also increased in a
different group of 7 patients. These findings were both statistically
significant. The amount of fatty change was minimal in most of the cases.
Fibrosis is associated with types III, IV, VI, IX, and X GSD. Our results support
previous studies stating that fibrosis may also be present and varies in extent
in type I GSD. Fatty change as large lipid vacuoles and NH may not be seen in
many cases of type I GSD. Therefore, histologic criteria for the diagnosis of GSD
may not be specific, and enzyme analysis should be performed.

Vimentin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100 protein, p53, and estrogen receptor 
expression in elastofibroma and nodular fasciitis.

Kayaselçuk F(1), Demirhan B, Kayaselçuk U, Ozerdem OR, Tuncer I.

Author information:

Center, Turkey.

Elastofibroma and nodular fasciitis are two rare, benign soft tissue tumors.
Elastofibroma is suggested to develop as a result of abnormal degeneration of
elastic fibers after local trauma. Similarly, fibroblastic proliferation, which
is triggered by local trauma or nonspecific inflammatory event, is suggested to
play an important role in the origin of nodular fasciitis. In this
immunohistochemical study, vimentin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, S-100
protein, p53, and estrogen receptors were applied to paraffin sections of 10
elastofibroma and four nodular fasciitis specimens to learn more about their
histogenesis and biological behavior. All cases with nodular fibrosis were
strongly SMA and vimentin positive, while only three weakly stained with estrogen
receptor antibody. There was no immunreactivity for S-100, desmin, and p53 in
nodular fasciitis. However, all elastofibroma cases were stained positively with 
vimentin. No staining was observed with SMA, S-100, desmin, and p53 in
elastofibroma. The staining pattern of nodular fasciitis supported a
myofibroblastic origin, whereas the SMA negativity in elastofibroma was
correlated with fibroblastic origin.

CD44 variant exons in leukemia and lymphoma.

Akisik E(1), Bavbek S, Dalay N.

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul University, Department of Basic Oncology, Oncology Institute Capa,
Istanbul, 34390, Turkey.

CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on different cell types that
functions in lymphocyte activation and homing, extracellular matrix adhesion and 
cellular migration. CD44 is encoded by a single gene composed of at least 20
exons. The standard CD44 protein (CD44S or CD44H) is the hematopoietic form of
CD44 in lymphoid cells. Variant isoforms (designated from v1 to v10) are formed
by addition of new exons to the extracellular domain. High levels of CD44v6
expression has been observed in some tumors and are associated with metastatic
spread. The aim of the present study was to investigate and evaluate expression
of the CD44v6 and v6-containing variants as a possible marker in chronic myeloid 
leukemia and lymphoma by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CD44
exon v6 was detected in all patients and all individuals in the control group.
CD44v6-v10 mRNA was observed in 25 patients but in none of the subjects in the
control group. CD44v6/v9-10, CD44v6-v7, CD44v6/v10 transcripts were detected in
11, 6, and 2 patients, respectively. CD44v6-7/v9-10 transcripts were not observed
in either the patients or the healthy individuals. We conclude that CD44v6-v10
expression may be associated with hematologic malignancies.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Yuzuncu
Yil, Van, Turkey.

Ganglioneuroblastoma, presumably originating from the adrenal medulla, was found 
in an 18-month-old sheep. Histologically, the tumour was mainly composed of
undifferentiated neuroblasts with neuropil and occasional ganglion cells. The
morphological and immunohistochemical features with respect to intermediate
filament proteins and the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour are described. The 
neoplastic cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin and
vimentin.

We investigated pS2 and HSP-70 protein expression in 36 pancreatic
adenocarcinomas for their effect on disease extent and patient outcome. The cases
were reviewed, histologically diagnosed, typed, graded, and staged. Lymphatic
vessel, blood vessel and perineural invasion as well as lymph node, resection
margin and adjacent organ involvements were re-evaluated. The standard
streptavidin biotin immunperoxidase method was used for immunostaining with pS2
and HSP-70 antibodies. Cytoplasmic staining with both antibodies was scored
semiquantitatively. The scores were compared with histopathological prognostic
parameters using statistical methods. Standard prognostic parameters and staining
scores were tested by survival analysis in terms of their effect on survival. All
the tumors showed a positive cytoplasmic reaction with HSP-70 antibody.
Seventy-seven percent of the tumors showed positive cytoplasmic staining with pS2
antibody (22.2% +, 13.9% ++ and 41.7% +++). There was a statistically significant
difference between HSP-70 staining scores with N status and final stages of the
tumors (Chi-square, p = 0.03 and p = 0.026, respectively), while neither direct
nor inverse correlation was detected for both parameters. PS2 staining scores
showed no statistically significant relationship with tumor grade T, M status,
perineural invasion, lymph and blood vessel invasion. In tumors with extensive
staining with pS2, tumor stage tended to be low (Chi square, p = 0.024, Kendall
Tau-b, r: -0.336, p = 0.036). There was a statistically significant difference
and inverse correlation between tumors with extensive pS2 staining and tumors
with less intense staining in terms of lymph node metastasis (Chi-square, p =
0.041, Kendall Tau: p = 0.024, r = -0,373). In the R0 resection group, in
univariate analysis, we found that with higher scores of HSP-70 staining, the
prognosis of the patient tended to improve. (Cox regression, p = 0.013). In
multivariate analysis, HSP-70 expression was found to be an independent
prognostic factor. We found no relationship between pS2 staining and patient
survival.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Antalya State Hospital, Turkey.

Tenascin (TN) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein (ECM) that participates in 
embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate
immunohistochemically the expression of TN in the normal, hyperplastic, and
neoplastic endometrium (endometrial adenocarcinoma). In the adenocarcinomas, the 
results were correlated with patient age, menopausal status, stage, grade,
myometrial invasion, and vascular invasion. TN expression was studied in the
following cases: proliferative endometrium (10 cases), early secretory
endometrium (10), secretory endometrium (10), simple hyperplasia (15), complex
hyperplasia (15), atypical hyperplasia (15), and endometrial adenocarcinomas
(25). Staining of basal membranes and the cytoplasm of the stromal and epithelial
cells was evaluated semiquantitatively. Positive staining was observed in the
vascular and glandular basal membranes, stromal cells, and epithelial cells of
proliferative, hyperplastic, and neoplastic endometrium. The difference in
percentage of stained stromal cells between the neoplastic and the nonneoplastic 
(proliferative and hyperplastic) endometrium was significant (p<0.005). However, 
the percentage of stained epithelial cell area in hyperplasia was significantly
higher than that of adenocarcinoma and functional endometrium (p<0.005). We
conclude that TN is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a role in
proliferation and possibly endometrial carcinogenesis.

Genomic amplification and oncoprotein overexpression of Her-2/neu was studied on 
ultrasound core needle biopsy specimens of the infiltrative ductal carcinomas of 
the breast. We performed two colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for
Her-2/neu and chromosome 17 and compared the FISH results with the
immunohistochemical overexpression of Her-2/neu protein by 2 antibodies (DAKO
HercepTest and the BioGenex monoclonal antibody AM 134-5M). Furthermore,
following radical mastectomy with axillary dissection, Her-2/neu status of the
patients were compared with the well known histopathological prognostic factors
such as histologic grade, tumor stage, lympho/ vascular invasion, surgical margin
status and Paget s disease. Amplification was demonstrated 27% of the cases.
Her-2/neu protein overexpression was detected in 47% and 80% of the cases with
CB11 and HercepTest respectively. We revealed statistically significant
association between the tumor, oncoprotein expression and oncogene amplification 
(p<0.05). The results of our study showed that combination of IHC and FISH
methods enhances the evaluation of tumor genetics at both gene and protein level 
for the analysis of Her-2/neu in breast carcinoma.

serk52@yahoo.com

Pleural malignant mesothelioma (PMM) is a rare tumor and it is commonly seen in
the form of multiple nodules or a diffuse tumor. A localized tumor mass in the
pleura is extremely rare. Only seven cases have been reported. In this report, we
present an additional case of localized PMM and describe the immunohistochemical 
and flow cytometric findings. A 61-year-old woman, without a history of smoking
or asbestos exposure, presented with a severe pain in her right shoulder and arm.
Chest radiography showed a solitary mass in the right upper lung field. Computed 
tomography showed a 5 cm right upper lung mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed
that the mass extended to the wall of the thorax. The patient underwent surgery
for total removal of the tumor. Pathology revealed a localized malignant
mesothelioma. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor was strongly and
diffusely positive for cytokeratins with high and low molecular weight, and
focally positive for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), but it was
negative for carcinoembryonic antigen, Factor VIII, alpha-fetoprotein and Leu-M1.
Flow cytometry showed an aneuploid DNA content in the tumor. The final diagnosis 
was localized malignant mesothelioma (epithelial type). The patient showed signs 
of local recurrence 5 months after surgery, and radiotherapy was given.

Leydig cell tumor of the testis: comparison of histopathological and
immunohistochemical features of three azoospermic cases and one malignant case.

Leydig cell tumors of the testis are rare, mostly presenting as a testicular mass
or as endocrinological symptoms. Here, three patients who were admitted for
investigation of primary infertility and one patient presenting with a testicular
mass are reported. The histological features were reviewed and an
immunohistochemical study was done using a panel of antibodies against
cytokeratin, vimentin, inhibin A, S-100, Ki-67, follicle-stimulating hormone,
luteinizing hormone, prolactin, p53, bcl-2, and c-erbB2. The latter case (lost
during follow up of metastatic disease) demonstrated massive tumor necrosis,
extension through the tunica albuginea, and a high mitotic activity and MIB-1
score. Only this malignant case was bcl-2 positive. Of the two oncogenic markers 
studied, none of the cases were positive for c-erb2, while p53 was positive in
more than 50% of cells in the malignant case and in one case of infertility with 
a large tumor, hemorrhage, focal necrosis and atypical cytological features. We
recommend the evaluation of infertile men for Leydig cell tumors, and we believe 
that a panel of antibodies, including Ki-67, p53 and bcl-2, used for
immunohistochemical analysis could be of diagnostic value in the identification
of malignant and borderline cases of Leydig cell tumor.

Autophagy and nuclear changes in FM3A breast tumor cells after epirubicin,
medroxyprogesterone and tamoxifen treatment in vitro.

Bilir A(1), Altinoz MA, Erkan M, Ozmen V, Aydiner A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul,
Turkey. bilira@istanbul.edu.tr

OBJECTIVE: Autophagy is a form of physiological programmed cell death which is
observable after hormonal withdrawal. In this study, the FM3A murine breast tumor
cell line was treated with epirubicin alone and with medroxyprogesterone acetate 
(MPA) or tamoxifen, to determine if structural and kinetic signs of autophagy may
also occur in an enhanced manner during epirubicin sensitization via hormonal
agents.
METHODS: One-week soft agar colony growth, 96-hour values of plating and pulse
thymidine labeling and electron microscopical examinations were performed
following treatment with MPA and tamoxifen alone or with epirubicin.
RESULTS: Tamoxifen induced signs of autophagy, which was enhanced when it was
combined with MPA. Epirubicin also induced autophagy of secretory granules, which
coalesced to form an intracytoplasmic lumen. Combining MPA with epirubicin
enhanced the formation of apoptotic blebs and chromatin fragmentation. When
epirubicin was combined with tamoxifen, peculiar nuclear structures were formed.
CONCLUSIONS: Hormonal agents may modulate anthracycline activity towards specific
patterns in eliciting cell death, via autophagy and/or as yet unknown
nucleolus-specific interactions.

Tumor angiogenesis is believed to be related to prognostic factors involved in
tumor development and metastasis. Using immunohistochemical methods, we evaluated
tumor angiogenesis in 42 early invasive breast cancer patients (T1-2, NO-1-2,
M0). Four patients received tamoxifen, 25 patients received CAF or CA, and 15
patients received CMF as adjuvant therapy. The median follow-up was 47 (range
24-119) months. Ten patients (43.5%) in the node-positive group and 2 patients
(10.5%) in the node-negative group relapsed (p = 0.019). The mean microvessel
count (MVC) was 60.3 3.05 per 200x field (range: 16-95). MVCs of postmenopausal
and premenopausal patients were 50.13 +/- 5.74 and 68.64 +/- 4.11, respectively, 
in the axillary lymph node (ALN)-negative patient group (p = 0.04). Staining was 
moderate to strong in 13 (68%) ALN-negative and in 17 (74%) ALN-positive patients
(p > 0.05), and was also moderate to strong in 82% of premenopausal patients and 
in 50% of postmenopausal patients (p = 0.037). There was no significant
relationship between angiogenesis and p53, nor was angiogenesis significantly
associated with the patient ER status and tumor size. No significant correlations
were found between OS/DFS and Factor VIII staining or p53 (log rank test, p >
0.05). Of all ALN-negative patients with increased angiogenesis, one patient of
the CMF group relapsed, but no recurrence occurred in patients undergoing
anthracycline-based chemotherapy (p > 0.05). On the other hand, of all
ALN-positive patients with increased angiogenesis, 5/14 patients treated with
anthracylcine and 2/2 CMF-treated patients relapsed (p = 0.175). Despite the
statistical insignificance, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy appears to 
be more effective than CMF as regards relapse prevention particularly in early
ALN-positive breast cancer patients with increased angiogenesis. Additional
studies are necessary to demonstrate the clinical importance of angiogenesis.

EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), p53, and proliferative markers provide
some clues as to the formation of several tumours. In this study the mechanism of
the genesis of parathyroid adenomas was investigated using immunohistochemistry. 
Sections of parathyroid adenomas from 12 cases were stained using PCNA
(proliferating cell nuclear antigen), EGFR, and p53 immunohistochemistry.
Correlations between PCNA LI (labelling index), EGFR expression, p53 expression, 
age, serum parathormone, Ca and P levels, and tumour diameter were investigated. 
PCNA LI was 45.8+/-33.1 (mean+/-standard deviation) and all the cases were
somewhat positive. Five cases (41.67 %) were EGFR positive. Maximum 10 % of the
cells were positive in these cases. All the cases were p53 negative. There was a 
correlation between PCNA LI and serum parathormone level (r=0.607, p=0.036).
According to these results, parathormone synthesis is high when the proliferative
activity of parathyroid adenoma is high. Four of the five EGFR-positive patients 
were below 35 years of age. These data may indicate that formation of parathyroid
adenoma in young patients is related to a mechanism involving EGFR. Absence of
p53 expression suggests that p53 mutation is not a common component of
parathyroid adenomas.

Faculty, Istanbul University, Turkey. ekremyavuz@ixir.com

In this study, the role of the count of intratumoral mast cells was examined and 
compared with the proliferative activity exhibited by Ki-67 indices in the
differential diagnosis of uterine smooth muscle tumors. Sixteen cases of
leiomyosarcoma, nine cases of atypical leiomyoma and 16 cases of ordinary
leiomyoma were included. The pathological features of the cases were determined
by reviewing the archive materials including the patient records and
hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Toluidine blue stain was used to highlight
the intratumoral mast cells and they were counted in at least 40 high power
fields. A standard streptavidin-biotin method was applied to the sections to
highlight the Ki-67 immunoreactive tumor cell nuclei. These proliferative cells
were counted in at least 10 high-power fields. Atypical leiomyomas tended to have
a higher quantity of intratumoral mast cells than leiomyosarcomas and ordinary
leiomyomas (P = 0.027 and P = 0.021, respectively). Leiomyosarcomas tended to
have higher Ki-67 immunoreactivity rates than atypical leiomyomas, although the
difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.82). We concluded that the
quantity of intratumoral mast cells is useful in the differential diagnosis
between leiomyosarcomas and atypical leiomyomas, while the cell proliferation
rate expressed by Ki-67 immunoreactivity has a limited value.

Bcl-2 and p53 expression in insular and in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas
with an insular pattern.

Peştereli HE(1), Oğüş M, Oren N, Karpuzoğlu G, Kerpuzoğlu T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.

Expression of p53 and bcl-2 oncogenes was investigated in poorly differentiated, 
so-called insular carcinomas of the thyroid gland and also in the follicular and 
papillary carcinomas with an insular component. Hematoxylin-eosin sections of 217
thyroid carcinomas were reevaluated for insular carcinoma and also for thyroid
carcinomas with an insular component. Immunohistochemical staining method was
used for detecting p53 and bcl-2 expression on paraffin blocks of three pure
insular, five follicular or papillary thyroid carcinomas with a major insular
component (more than 50%) and six with a minor insular component (20-50%). Flow
cytometry was also performed in these cases. None of the cases showed p53
immunoreactivity. Bcl-2 expression was observed in all cases and the most intense
staining was seen in insular areas. All the cases were diploid. We suggest that
bcl-2 plays a role in loss of differentiation of thyroid carcinomas.

AIMS: Angiogenesis, an important prognostic factor in several tumours, is a
complex event mediated by angiogenic factors released from cancer cells and host 
immune cells. Among the host immune cells, a role has been implicated for mast
cells in tumour progression via promoting angiogenesis. Data have been recorded
that indicate a correlation between intratumoral neovascularisation, as assessed 
by microvessel density (MVD), and prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of
the oesophagus. However, a correlation between mast cell density (MCD) and either
prognosis or angiogenesis has not been delineated yet in this disease. The aim of
this study was to investigate the prognostic value of MVD and MCD in SCC of the
oesophagus. The correlation between MVD and MCD was also evaluated.
METHODS: MVD and MCD were investigated in tumour specimens from 53 patients
diagnosed with SCC of the oesophagus. Intratumoral microvessels were stained with
anti-CD34 antibody and mast cells with toluidine blue before being measured by
light microscopy.
RESULTS: Both MVD and MCD were associated with the depth of wall invasion, lymph 
node metastasis, and tumour progression (stage). A significant correlation was
noted between MVD and MCD values (r = 0.72). The prognosis was significantly
worse in patients with high MVD (> or = 92) and high MCD (> or = 18) values.
Multivariate analysis indicated that MVD and stage were independent predictors of
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the suggestion that MVD is a reliable
prognostic marker in SCC of the oesophagus. Moreover, MCD may have a role in the 
angiogenesis of these tumours and might be responsible for their aggressive
behaviour.

OBJECTIVE: To identify different cell types in the testis by using touch imprint 
cytology and to compare the cytologic findings to the histopathologic diagnosis
in infertile men.
STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study used touch imprint preparations and included
20 infertile men. The biopsy material obtained was stained with toluidine blue,
May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain and Papanicolaou stain. The cytologic results for
oligospermic, normospermic and azospermic men were compared to the specific
histopathologic diagnosis. The proportion of spermatogenic versus Sertoli cells
was calculated. The scores were compared between three groups based on the
results of the histologic biopsy: normal spermatogenesis, hypospermatogenesis and
incomplete spermatogenic arrest.
RESULTS: The mean ratio of the spermatogenic cells versus Sertoli cells was
statistically significantly different in the three groups (P < .01). The mean
ratio of spermatogenic cells to Sertoli cells was higher in cases with normal
spermatogenesis than in cases with hypospermatogenesis and incomplete
spermatogenic arrest, revealing a statistical difference (P<.01). This ratio was 
not statistically significantly different between the hypospermatogenesis and
incomplete spermatogenic arrest groups.
CONCLUSION: A cytologic demonstration of germinal cells by using touch imprint
preparations may be a guide for histologic diagnosis.

Infarction after fine needle aspiration biopsy of pleomorphic adenoma of the
parotid gland.

Bayramoğlu H(1), Düzcan E, Akbulut M, Topuz B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine, Denizli,
Turkey. hbayramoglu@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a well-established and safe method
for the rapid diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. A few clinically important
complications, including bleeding, infection and inflammatory reactions, result
from FNA. In a small number of cases FNA has been followed by varying degrees of 
necrosis in some organs. In the literature there are a few reports associated
with necrosis in a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland following FNA.
CASE: A 27-year-old female had a two-year history of a right parotid mass. FNA
revealed pleomorphic adenoma. A histologic diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma of
the right parotid with infarction was made.
CONCLUSION: Necrosis associated with infarction may cause diagnostic problems. It
is not a sufficient sign of malignant transformation.

Benign phyllodes tumors and fibroadenomas are two types of fibroepithelial tumors
of breast that are usually difficult to differentiate. The purpose of this study 
is to evaluate the proliferative activity of these tumors and to find out if it
helps in differential diagnosis. Thirty-one benign phyllodes tumors and twelve
cellular fibroadenomas were retrieved from the archives of Pathology Department
of Akdeniz University, School of Medicine. Proliferating activity of epithelial
and stromal cells were evaluated by using labeling index (LI) of proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 antigen by immunohistochemistry. The
results were compared with other clinicopathologic findings. There was not any
significant difference between the proliferating activity of phyllodes tumor and 
cellular fibroadenomas. Mean LI of PCNA was 28.01 (+/-22.85) in stromal cells and
56.57 (+/-30.98) in epithelial cells of phyllodes tumor where it was 28.92
(+/-24.02) and 62.53 (+/-32.56) in fibroadenomas. Ki-67 indices were 0.05
(+/-0.19) in stromal cells, 2.65 (+/-12.53) in epithelial cells of phyllodes
tumors and 0.0 (+/-0) in stromal cells, 0.43 (+/-0.63) in epithelial cells of
fibroadenomas. There was no correlation between the diameter of tumors and
proliferating activity in both groups. Proliferating activity, determined by
immunohistochemistry with PCNA and Ki-67 antibodies did not reveal significant
difference between phyllodes tumor and fibroadenoma.

Cellular proliferation programmed cell death (apoptosis) are associated with
tumor growth in general, and prostate cancer growth in particular. The aim of
this study was to examine the expression of the apoptosis regulating genes bcl-2 
and p53 and Gleason score in core needle biopsy specimens of prostate cancer
using immunohistochemistry. We studied bcl-2 and p53 expression in 12 cases of
low grade (Gleason score 2-5), 12 cases of intermediate grade (Gleason score 6-7)
and 8 cases of high grade (Gleason score 8-10) prostate cancer. Overexpression of
bcl-2 was noted in 3 of 32 patients (9.32%). One of them was high grade; others
were intermediate grades. Expression of p53 was observed in 3 of low grades;
others were high grade. The statistical analysis of present data suggest that
there is no significant relation between p53 and bcl-2 expression and Gleason
score in prostate cancer.

Beneficial effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in cancer therapy is
partly mediated via its antiangiogenic activity. The same is true for the
antitumoral action of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. We have studied two
liposoluble drugs, MPA and the analgesic ibuprofen, on glioma vascularization in 
vivo. In this study we have shown that, until the sacrifice at 27. day after
tumor inoculation in the right hemisphere, MPA had a slight though insignificant 
activity to reduce the fatality of C6 glioma, growing in right cerebral
hemisphere of male Wistar rats. But ibuprofen both alone or with MPA had no
effect on survival with gavage application of a 30 mg/kg/day dosing regime. On
histological analysis, intra- and peritumoral vessels were counted. Progesterone 
seemed to lower intratumoral, but to increase peritumoral vessels, especially
glomeruloids, around the tumor mass. Coadministration of ibuprofen acted to
suppress the peritumoral vessel increase, and to enhance lymphomonocytic
infiltration around tumor vessels.

Presence of endocervical cells and number of slides in cervicovaginal smears:
differences in performance between gynecologists.

Celasun B(1).

(1)Department of Pathology, Gülhane Military Medical Academy and School of
Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. bulent.celasun@ixir.com

OBJECTIVE: To study the association of precancerous cervical lesions with the
presence of endocervical cells on Pap smears; and to evaluate gynecologists'
approaches to the information on smear reports regarding endocervical cell
status.
STUDY DESIGN: Pap smear reports on 1,637 samples sent by 12 gynecologists were
analyzed. The presence of endocervical cells, number of glass slides used per
patient, and frequency and distribution of "atypia" and of pathogenetic
microorganisms were recorded. Gynecologists' performances were compared, and
their reactions to the reported lack of endocervical cells in their smears were
evaluated.
RESULTS: Atypia was detected significantly more frequently in samples with
endocervical cells (1 in 664 versus 31 in 973, P < .01). Likelihood of detecting 
a pathogenetic microorganism, however, was not affected by the presence or
absence of endocervical cells. In samples from certain gynecologists,
endocervical cells were present most of the time, and in others they were
generally lacking. This pattern did not change over time; specifically, the
performance of the latter group of gynecologists did not improve in spite of
their receiving information on the absence of endocervical cells in their
samples.
CONCLUSION: The performance of the "smear taker" is an important component of Pap
smear screening practice. Efforts to increase the quality of service should cover
not only laboratories but also gynecologists and others who take smears.
Screening can only be successful as a system in the presence of good samples.

Fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma of the distal femur: case report and literature
review.

Beysukent, Ankara, Turkey.

A case of a 9-year-old boy with fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma located in the
distal femur is presented. Fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma is a rare tumor. There
have been 17 cases reported since 1984. The presenting complaint was pain and
local discomfort. Radiological examination showed lytic and sclerotic lesions
located in the distal femur. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that there was no 
soft tissue expansion. Differential diagnosis included fibrocartilaginous
dysplasia, dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, desmoplastic fibroma, fibrosarcoma
and low-grade osteosarcoma. The diagnosis of the tumor in a state hospital would 
not have been possible. Wide resection of the tumor and resection arthrodesis
with an intramedullary nail has yielded good results. The patient has been
disease free for 4 years. Pathological diagnosis of this very rare tumor may be
challenging; the treatment should be wide resection of the tumor.

In this study, the possible toxic effects of Alternariol Methyl Ether (AME) and
Tenuazonic Acid (TeA) produced by Alternaria species on esophagus of mice were
investigated by using light and electron microscopy techniques. Mice were orally 
fed daily with AME or TeA for 10 months and at the end of this period, the
effects of these chemicals on the esophageal mucosa were determined. By light
microscopic examination, moderate and severe dysplasia characterized by loss of
polarity, nuclear pleomorphism, and hyperchromasia were observed in TeA-treated
animals. Electron-microscopic examination of TeA-treated mucosal epithelial cells
revealed pyknosis in some nuclei, granulation and increase in chromatin mass,
irregularities in the nuclear contours, vacuolization in nucleoplasms. and marked
pleomorphism in the nuclei. In conclusion, our results suggested that TeA has
higher toxicity as evidenced by dysplastic transformation.

The prevalence of the HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 alleles in 55 Turkish children with
celiac disease and 50 control subjects was investigated by using an
allele-specific DNA-based polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primer
(PCR-SSP) method. The frequency of the DQA1*0501 and DQB1*02 alleles was higher
in celiac patients than in controls. The DQA1B1 (*0501; *02) haplotype was
present in 46 (83.6%) patients and only in 12 (24%) controls. The remaining 9
celiac patients which were negative for DQA1B1 (*0501;*02) carried the DQA1B1
(*03;*0302) haplotype. We found an excess homozygosity of the DQB1*02 allele and 
the DQA1B1 (*0501;*02) haplotype in the patients. No statistically significant
correlation was found between the homozygosity of this haplotype or the DQB1*02
allele and an earlier onset of the disease.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Division of Romatology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty,
University of Istanbul, Turkey.

Among the cutaneous manifestations, nodular lesions are rather common in Behçet
syndrome. The histologic nature of these lesions has been a matter of
controversy. To establish their distinguishing features, biopsy specimens from
nodular lesions of 24 patients with Behçet syndrome, 25 with nodular vasculitis
(NV), and 20 with erythema nodosum (EN) were compared. Statistical analysis
revealed insignificant differences between most of the histologic features of
Behçed syndrome and NV. However, neutrophil-predominating infiltrate in the
subcutis was more common in Behçet syndrome, while necrosis and granuloma
formation were encountered more frequently in NV. The differences between Behçed 
syndrome and EN were more significant. Septal panniculitis,
lymphocyte-predominating infiltrate, absence of many vascular changes as well as 
vasculitis, and necrosis were features in favor of EN. Nodular lesions of Behçet 
syndrome are mainly neutrophilic vascular reactions with histologic features
similar to NV but significantly differing from EN associated with other systemic 
diseases.

Turkey.

The odontogenic myxoma is a rare, benign, but locally invasive tumour of the
jaws. Radiographically, it is a bone destroying lesion and has ill-defined
borders. Histological characteristics are spindle and stellate-shaped tumour
cells and a distinct myxomatous stroma. Bony islands that represent residual
trabeculae are found scattered throughout the lesion. This report describes a
case of odontogenic myxoma that shows diffusely dispersed osteocement-like
spherular calcified bodies, unlike residual bone trabeculae, and discusses its
differential diagnosis.

Adenomas of the parathyroid gland, the majority of which contain mixed cell
populations, are the most frequent cause of primary hyperparathyroidism.
Parathyroid adenomas composed exclusively of water-clear cells are exceptionally 
rare. Until now, only 2 cases have been reported in English literature. We report
a water-clear cell adenoma of the parathyroid gland in an intrathyroidal
position, which has not been described previously according to our knowledge.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of tumor proliferation in
patients with nonurachal bladder adenocarcinoma. Samples were obtained from 16
patients (12 men and 4 women, mean age 62 years) with primary nonrurachal bladder
adenocarcinoma. The 16 formalin-fixed specimens were stained
immunohistochemically for Ki-67 antigen and PCNA using MIB-1 and PC-10
antibodies. In addition, the AgNOR quantity was assessed using the colloid silver
nitrate staining technique in all cases. The Ki-67, PCNA and AgNOR proliferation 
indices were found to be significantly higher in high-grade and invasive tumors. 
The higher the grade (p<0.01) and stage (p<0.01), the higher were the
proliferation indices. Patients whose tumor samples had a high Ki-67, PCNA and
AgNOR proliferation index showed a higher incidence of local recurrence (p<0.01) 
and distant metastasis (p<0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that Ki-67,
PCNA and AgNOR proliferation scores may be important prognostic indices in
nonurachal bladder adenocarcinomas.

Protective effects of vitamin E and selenium on the renal morphology in rats fed 
high-cholesterol diets.

The histopathological effects of cholesterol and the protective effects of
vitamin E and selenium (Se) on renal histology were examined in Sprague-Dawley
rats. Light-microscopic evaluation of the renal cortex revealed: glomerular
fibrosis, cellular and mesangial proliferation, capillary obliteration and
cholesterol crystals in the tubular lumina of the cholesterol-fed group. These
results suggest that oxidated LDL (O-LDL) is a cytotoxic factor which stimulates 
mesangial cell and matrix proliferation. Ultrastructurally, small and large lipid
vacuolization in intracapillary lumina, adhesion of epithelial foot processes,
mesangial foam cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were seen in the
cholesterol-fed group. In the groups fed cholesterol + vitamin E, cholesterol +
Se and cholesterol + vitamin E + Se, morphological improvements were observed. It
appeared that an excess in O-LDL, reactive oxygen species and growth factors
might play an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. In
addition, it was concluded that antioxidant therapy may prevent LDL oxidation and
generation of free radicals.

In vitro effects of NSAIDS and paracetamol on oxidative stress-related parameters
of human erythrocytes.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Toxicology, Pharmacy Faculty of Hacettepe University, Ankara,
Turkey. hilmi@tr.net

In vitro effects of widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
paracetamol were studied on oxidative stress-related parameters of human red
blood cells (RBC). Membrane lipid integrity, activity of erythrocyte antioxidant 
enzymes; i.e. glutathione S-transferase (GST), selenium dependent-glutathione
peroxidase (Se-GPx), and catalase (CAT), and hemolytic/stabilizing action of the 
drugs on erythrocyte membrane were assessed. Diclofenac, indomethacin and
paracetamol at the therapeutic and higher concentrations, and dipyrone at the
high concentration exerted a statistically significant inhibition on H2O2 forced 
erythrocytic membrane lipid peroxidation (EMLP). Increased hemolysis was observed
by Na-salicylate, naproxen and ketorolac at therapeutic and higher
concentrations, and by diclofenac and tiaprofenic acid at high concentrations,
while the others seemed to stabilize the membrane at the same conditions.
Na-salicylate inhibited GST activity at the therapeutic dose, however activated
the same enzyme at high concentrations. Naproxen, tiaprofenic acid and piroxicam 
caused a decrease in GST activity at therapeutic doses. Paracetamol caused an
activation at a high dose. Tiaprofenic acid, ketorolac, naproxen and piroxicam
caused a significant Se-GPx inhibition. Erythrocyte CAT activity was increased by
Na-salicylate, acemetacin, and tenoxicam at the therapeutic, and by dipyrone at
the high concentration. Our results suggest that NSAIDs and paracetamol may be
involved in oxidative/antioxidative processes of human erythrocytes. Also, the in
vitro EMLP method can be considered as a simple test for evaluating possible
antioxidant potency of chemicals.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression in laryngeal preneoplastic and neoplastic
lesions.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a member of gelatinases, is particularly
important in the digestion of nonfibrillary and denaturated collagens; thus, it
may play a role in tissue remodeling and in the invasion of malignant cells. The 
expression of MMP-2 has not yet been described in preneoplastic lesions of the
larynx thus far. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the expression
of MMP-2 plays a role in early laryngeal carcinogenesis. Laryngectomy specimens
of 20 invasive carcinoma cases were studied. The slides with atypical
hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma were selected from
laryngectomy specimens. On these slides, 23 atypical hyperplasia and 17 carcinoma
in situ areas were identified. MMP-2 expression was scored immunohistochemically 
on paraffin tissue sections using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. MMP-2
expression in all three groups was statistically different. A sequential increase
in MMP-2 expression correlated significantly with the hypothesis of multistep
carcinogenesis. In contrast, MMP-2 expression was not related to tumor stage,
lymph node metastasis, or differentiation in squamous cell carcinomas. In
conclusion, this sequential increase in MMP-2 expression points to an altered
expression of MMP-2 in early neoplastic transformation in laryngeal mucosa,
followed by an increasing expression during the progression of the disease.

Faculty, Ankara, Turkey. nmollaoglu@hotmail.com

The restriction site mutation assay (RSM) can be used to measure base changes
which occur in the DNA coding for bacterial restriction enzymes. The aim of this 
study was to investigate whether DNA, of sufficient quantity and quality for
analysis by RSM, could be extracted from cells collected from precancerous
lesions using a cytological smear technique. Six smears were collected from each 
of five lesions of leukoplakia displaying a variety of clinical appearances.
Three methods for the extraction of DNA were compared. The commercial extraction 
method was shown to be most convenient and reproducible, routinely providing 1-5 
microg of DNA per sample. Cell populations collected by a cytological smear
technique can provide DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for analysis of RSM.

In vitro Candidacidal effect of polymorphonuclear neutrophils of Behçet's
patients with or without ocular involvement.

Tekeli A(1), Tekeli O, Ozdemir O.

Author information: 
(1)Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and
Clinical Microbiology, Turkey. tekeli@dialup.ankara.edu.tr

In this study our objective was to evaluate the in vitro candidacidal effect of
polymorphonuclear neutrophils of Behçet's patients with or without ocular
involvement (inactive phase). Fifteen patients with ocular involvement and 15
patients without ocular involvement were studied. Candidacidal assay was
performed to assess the in vitro killing of Candida species by the
polymorphonuclear neutrophils of both the study and control groups. In brief,
peripheral venous polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers and
patients with Behçet's disease were obtained by density gradient centrifugation. 
These cells were incubated with Candida spp. (Candida albicans, Candida
tropicalis, Candida glabrata) for 3 h. Samples were seeded onto yeast extract
peptone dextrose agar, incubated at 25 degrees C in a 5% humidified incubator for
another 48 h, and formed colonies were counted. There was no significant
difference between the candidacidal activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils of 
healthy volunteers and of Behçet's patients with or without ocular involvement.
Although various immunological abnormalities are reported in Behçet's disease, in
vitro killing of Candida spp., which is one of the parameters for the phagocytic 
function of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, was not affected.

Postmortem examination of a 35-year-old parous woman who died suddenly revealed a
hydatid cyst mass located at the right ventricular outlet, with a grossly
discernible defect opening to the pulmonary outflow tract. Pulmonary hemorrhage, 
follicular bronchitis, and bronchiolitis also were present, with severe acute
purulent exudation in the airways. Hydatid cyst complications must be kept in
mind when dealing with sudden deterioration and death in patients who are
residents of regions where echinococcosis is endemic.

Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the parotid gland. Report of a case with extensive
amyloid deposition masking the cytologic and histopathologic picture.

Ustün MO(1), Ekinci N, Payzin B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Kocaeli University, and the
Departments of Pathology and Internal Medicine, Izmir Atatürk Training Hospital, 
Izmir, Turkey. hasanustun@netscape.net

BACKGROUND: Extramedullary plasmacytomas are uncommon. Although approximately 90%
occur in the head and neck region, parotid gland localization is extremely rare.
CASE: This report describes fine needle aspiration and histopathologic findings
in an extramedullary plasmacytoma arising in the left parotid gland of a
62-year-old man. Aspiration smears showed multiple amorphous clumps of material
admixed with ductal epithelial cells, multinucleated giant cells and inflammatory
cells rich in plasma cells, suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. In surgical
material, excessive amyloid deposition was observed. Six months later the tumor
recurred, and in the second surgical specimen clusters of atypical plasma cells
among amyloid deposits was noted. Clinical and laboratory examination excluded
multiple myeloma. After local recurrence, radiotherapy was applied. Ten months
later the patient was well and without systemic involvement.
CONCLUSION: Two points are important. First, in the salivary gland region,
because of the focal metachromasia of amyloid with Giemsa stain, amyloid can be
confused with the chondromyxoid matrix of pleomorphic adenoma. Second, although
localized forms of amyloid tumor exist, one should keep in mind that amyloid may 
be so abundant that it may mask an underlying plasma cell neoplasm, as in our
case.

Curschmann's spirals in cyst fluid associated with a teratoma of the ovary. A
case report.

Canda T(1), Ozkal S, Ozer E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylül University, School of Medicine,
Inciralti, 35340 Izmir, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Curschmann's spirals, first described more than 100 years ago, are
common in cytologic specimens from the respiratory tract and have also been
observed in cervical smears, urine, and peritoneal and pleural effusions. No
simple theory can explain the exact mode of spiral formation, which is presumed
to be a complex physical and biochemical phenomenon.
CASE: A 29-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, underwent right ovarian cyst
excision after an abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a cystic mass of the 
right ovary. Histologically, the cyst was an immature cystic teratoma containing 
respiratory epithelium with mucous glands in the submucosa. Cytologic examination
of the cyst fluid showed the presence of Curschmann's spirals.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, the formation of Curschmann's spirals
associated with an immature cystic teratoma has not been previously reported. In 
this situation, the presence of spirals could be explained by formation from
mucus normally found in that environment.

(1)Department of Pathology, Gynecologic Pathology Division, Istanbul Medical
Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey. tuzlalips@turk.net

We present an endocervical polyp with heterologous elements. Although a few
neoplastic cervical lesions with cartilaginous and adipocytic heterologous tissue
have been reported, an endocervical polyp with heterologous cartilage and adipose
tissue has not been reported before our case. The patient was a 33-year-old woman
who presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. On physical examination, there were
no remarkable findings other than a cervical polyp protruding into the cervical
canal. The polyp was removed. Pathological examination revealed an endocervical
polyp with typical epithelial features. The stroma of the polyp contained mature 
cartilage islands and adipose tissue. There were also many thick-walled vascular 
structures. Neither stromal periglandular condensation nor atypia was found.
Mitotic figures were not observed. Arteriolar structures did not contain internal
elastic lamina. In our opinion, these pathological findings are all consistent
with a hamartomatous lesion rather than with a true neoplasm.

Germ cell tumors constitute a very complicated group of tumors of the ovary and
their histogenesis is not yet clarified. Besides their histological
heterogeneity, sarcomatous areas have also been described. A right ovarian mass
was found in a 23-year-old female, who was being treated in the hospital for
miscarriage. Disseminated omental metastases were detected during abdominal
laparotomy. Pathological examination of the dissected material revealed the tumor
to be a mixed germ cell tumor (immature teratoma and dysgerminoma) with
sarcomatous component. Areas resembling granulosa cell tumor were also
encountered. This ovarian tumor with many different histopathological features is
presented with a review of the literature. The importance of thorough sampling in
determining the type and extent of the malignant components is also emphasized
due to their direct relation with the prognosis.

Atypical epithelial changes and mutant p53 gene expression in ovarian
endometriosis.

Bayramoğlu H(1), Düzcan E.

Author information: 
(1)Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Denizli,
Turkey. hbayramoglu@hotmail.com

It has been reported that cases of ovarian endometriosis those with epithelial
cytological atypia have potential for malignant transformation. This study was
planned to determine the incidence of atypical endometriosis and its cytological 
criteria, to evaluate the malignant potential of atypical endometriosis via
immunohistochemical methods (p53). In this study we evaluated 140 samples
obtained from 120 cases of ovarian endometriosis and 10 ovarian endometrioid
carcinomas that have been previously diagnosed histopathologically. We
re-evaluated endometriosis cases with respect to their epithelial and stromal
features, existence of acute or chronic inflammatory cells in endometriotic
epithelium or stroma and other accompanying histological findings. We observed
atypia in 7 (5.8%) cases; reactive atypia in 37 (30.8%) cases, no atypia in 76
(63.4%) cases. We evaluated immunohistochemical p53 expression in 7 atypical
cases, 37 reactive atypical cases, and in 10 of those without atypia and in 10
endometrioid carcinoma cases. We noted no staining in cases with atypia, reactive
atypia and without atypia while 3 cases of endometrioid carcinoma had positive
staining for p53. We concluded that prominent nucleolus and angulation of nuclear
contour could be added to criteria of atypia that were mentioned before in the
literature. In our study, even though p53 expression could not be shown with
immunohistochemical methods in atypical endometriotic cases; it can not be
determined that atypical endometriosis lesions are not premalignant. Still,
endometriosis cases should be evaluated carefully by the pathologist for foci of 
cytological atypia and it should be kept in mind that malignant transformation
might occur in these atypical endometriosis cases.

Several studies have been demonstrated the value of c-ErbB-2 and Bcl-2 in
predicting the biological behaviour of tumors. The aim of this study was to
investigate Bcl-2 and c-ErbB-2 expression in colorectal carcinomas and the
correlation between their presence and other clinicopathologic parameters.
Eighty-six colorectal carcinomas and 17 adenomas were stained with Bcl-2 and
c-ErbB-2 immunohistochemically. Staining patterns were assessed
semi-quantitatively and correlated with tumor size, Duke s classification, tumor 
differentiation, mucinous characteristic and anatomic locations. We detected
Bcl-2 expression in 10 of 17 adenomas (58.8 %) and 31 of 86 carcinomas (36.04 %).
Positive staining in normal mucosa was observed only in the compartment of
cryptic cells. However neither the difference in the rates of Bcl-2 positivity in
adenoma and carcinoma groups, nor the correlation with other mentioned
clinicopathological parameters, were found statistically significant. Bcl-2
expression was found to be significantly high in mucinous carcinomas. Expression 
of c-ErbB-2 was observed in 12 of 86 (13.95 %) carcinomas. It was not detected in
adenomas and normal mucosa. Although the incidence of c-ErbB-2 in nonmucinous
carcinoma was higher than that of mucinous carcinoma, this was not significant.
In addition we were unable to show any significant relation between c-ErbB-2
expression and other clinicopathologic features. Our result suggest that c-ErbB-2
protein expression in colorectal carcinomas, is not very frequent event. There is
no correlation between c-ErbB-2 expression and malignant potential of colorectal 
carcinomas. Higher expressions of Bcl-2 in adenomas than carcinomas suggest us a 
possible role of Bcl-2 in early carcinogenesis of colon. However since we were
unable to find any significant correlation between Bcl-2 expression and other
parameters the impact of this gene on biological behavior is still unclear for
us.

Intracranial plasma cell granuloma.

Tekkök IH(1), Ventureyra EC, Jimenez CL.

Author information: 
(1)Bayindir Medical Center, Ankara, Turkey.

Plasma cell granulomas (PCGs) are benign, inflammatory masses of unknown etiology
composed of polyclonal mature plasma and lymphoid cells. The lung is their most
common location, and occurrence within the cranial cavity is extremely rare. We
report the case of an 11-year-old girl who presented with seizures and was
diagnosed as having a dural-based right frontal tumor that extended toward the
sagittal sinus and the falx. The lesion was totally excised, together with the
abnormal dura. A limited cortical excision was also performed using
electrocorticographic guidance. Histopathologic diagnosis of intracranial plasma 
cell granuloma was reached after extensive immunohistochemical tests and electron
microscopy. This is the third case of PCG with description of changes in the
neighboring cerebral tissue. Although PCGs are well-circumscribed lesions,
lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis occur within 
the adjacent cortex. Disturbed cortical lamination, as we have observed, appears 
to be a histological finding that has not been described previously.

Adenomyolipoma of the uterus: a case report.

Yavuz E(1), Tuzlali S, Iplikçi A, Ilhan R.

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pathology Department, Breast and Gynecological
Pathology Division, Turkey.

Adenomyolipoma of the uterus is a rare, benign, polypoid lesion considered to be 
of hamartomatous origin or represent an unusual type of benign Müllerian mixed
tumour with a heterologous element. The authors present a case of uterine
adenomyolipoma and discuss its pathogenesis. A 62-year-old woman complained of
lower abdominal pain and postmenopausal bleeding. Imaging techniques revealed a
solid ovarian mass and a polypoid intrauterine lesion. The frozen section
diagnosis of the ovarian mass was a thecoma. A total hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. On gross examination a pedunculated,
polypoid lesion of 7x4.5x3cm was found in the uterine cavity. Microscopically,
the polypoid lesion contained both epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The
epithelial elements were endometrial glands of various size, formed by
proliferative endometrial cells. The mesenchymal elements were composed of
endometrial stroma, smooth muscle and mature adipocytes. Both the epithelial and 
the mesenchymal elements showed a benign appearance, were intermingled with each 
other and periglandular stromal condensation was absent. The lesion had an
irregular surface. Microscopic diagnosis was an adenomyolipoma. The peculiar
shape and microscopic features of this lesion suggested that it was a variant of 
benign Müllerian mixed tumour.

A 58-year-old woman with a history of Cushing's syndrome for three years
presented with a mediastinal mass and received the diagnosis of small cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma of the thymus invading the pericardium. On
immunohistochemical study, the neoplastic cells reacted with antibodies against
cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, 
synaptophysin, and ACTH. Clinicopathologic findings of this rare case of ectopic 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome are discussed with a literature

Verumontanum mucosal gland hyperplasia is associated with atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia of the prostate.

Muezzinoglu B(1), Erdamar S, Chakraborty S, Wheeler TM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Kocaeli University Medical School, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Verumontanum mucosal gland hyperplasia (VMGH) and atypical
adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) are both small glandular proliferations that are
histologically and topographically unique.
METHODS: One hundred ten randomly selected, whole-mount, radical prostatectomy
specimens were reviewed to assess independently the normal histology of the
prostatic urethra and periurethral area and the association of AAH with other
pathologic features, including VMGH. The degree of nodular hyperplasia was
evaluated by total prostate weight for comparison purposes.
RESULTS: Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia was found in 37 cases (33.6%) and was
nearly always (32/37) associated with nodules of nodular hyperplasia.
Verumontanum mucosal gland hyperplasia was present in 32 cases (29.1%; 21 with
AAH, 11 without AAH). There was a significant association between presence of
VMGH and AAH (P <.001, Fisher exact test). The degree of nodular hyperplasia was 
not significantly different between prostates with and without VMGH or AAH.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AAH and VMGH occur more commonly in
prostates when the other is also present.

The structures of sacs from boys and girls with inguinal hernia, and from boys
with undescended testis or hydrocele were evaluated and compared. Particular
attention was directed to determine if a clue helpful in describing the mechanism
of obliteration of processus vaginalis (PV) exists. Sacs from boys (n: 8) and
girls (n: 11) with inguinal hernia, and sacs from boys with undescended testis
(n: 11) and hydrocele (n: 10) were obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin,
trichrome and elastic van Gieson. The histologic structures of each group of
samples were determined and compared. Smooth muscle was presented as a layer
within the sacs of girls and boys with inguinal hernia. However, smooth muscle
bundles were sparsely presented in sacs associated with undescended testis and
hydrocele. Myofibroblasts were commonly encountered in sacs associated with
inguinal hernia. The smooth muscle was invariably presented in sacs that
contained myofibroblasts. While sacs from boys only had smooth muscle, sacs from 
girls also had striated muscle. Since the muscle components of sacs vary, PV is
sexually dimorphic. Persistence of PV seems to be associated with the presence of
smooth muscle and myofibroblasts within the sac wall. Myofibroblasts may have
originated from the smooth muscle, and reflect the attempts at obliteration of
PV.

We report an unusual tumor related to the meninges designated as a calcifying
fibroma of the meninges. Our patient was a 44-year-old man.The tumor was located 
in the right frontotemporoparietal region and was excised totally via a right
frontotemporoparietal craniotomy. The patient had recovered completely, and no
recurrence was observed in a follow-up period of three years.
Histopathologically, we noted scattered spindle cells among the hyalinized
collagenous stroma, dystrophicpsammomatous calcifications, abundant perivascular 
hyalinization and cartilagenous metaplasia. Immunohistochemically, the tumor
cells showed actin, smooth muscle and vimentin immunreactivities.
Ultrastructurally, spindle cells showed fibroblastic features. The lesion is a
true tumor and it should be kept in mind in the differential diagnoss of
meningeal calcifying lesions.

Clinicopathologic evaluation of CDw75 antigen expression in patients with gastric
carcinoma.

Situated on mature B lymphocytes, CDw75 antigen is a sialylated carbohydrate
epitope generated by the enzyme beta-galactosyl alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase.
Although CDw75 antigen expression was found to be correlated with aggressive
behaviour of tumour cells in gastric adenocarcinomas, its prognostic role still
remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the value of CDw75 
antigen expression as a marker of the metastatic potential and prognosis of
gastric adenocarcinomas. CDw75 antigen expression was evaluated
immunohistochemically in 64 tumours and their nodal metastases. The correlation
was analysed between CDw75 antigen expression and selected clinicopathological
variables, including survival. Positive staining was detected in 31 cases.
Non-neoplastic gastric mucosa was consistently negative. CDw75 expression was
correlated with larger tumour size (p<0.006), infiltrative growth pattern
(p<0.044), advanced stage (p<0.0006), and positive lymph nodes (p<0.0003). The
overall survival rate of patients with CDw75 expression was 28%, which was
significantly worse than that of patients without CDw75 expression (53%)
(p<0.0005). Multivariate analysis showed that CDw75 expression was an independent
prognostic indicator, together with the growth pattern of the tumour. These
results indicate that immunohistochemical detection of CDw75 antigen expression
may be a good indicator of metastatic potential and of prognosis in patients with
gastric carcinomas.

Value of p53 protein in biological behavior of basal cell carcinoma and in normal
epithelia adjacent to carcinomas.

Mutations in p53 gene are the most frequent gene alterations in human cancer. In 
this study, we have used the monoclonal antibody (DO7) to evaluate the role of
the p53 gene mutation in the progression of basal cell carcinomas towards
invasion. We tested the positivity for p53 protein in tumor cells in six cases of
basosquamous cell carcinoma (BSCC), in twelve cases of infiltrative basal cell
carcinoma (IBCC) and twenty-four cases of non-infiltrative basal cell carcinoma
(NIBCC) in order to evaluate its potential prognostic significance. We also
tested the expression of p53 protein in normal epithelia adjacent to carcinomas
in order to determine its role in tumor progression. p53 protein staining with
some peripheral accentuation was identified in 42,9% of all groups. No
correlation was found between the immunreactivity of p53 protein and recurrence, 
pattern of tumor, diameter of the tumors and sex. However, there were
statistically significant differences in positivity of p53 protein in normal
epithelia adjacent to carcinomas and age of patients (t value: 2,21; p: 0,034).
Results of the study suggest that the increasein p53 mutation frequency of
morphologically normal epidermis was related to age and was independent of the
degree of differentiation of BCC.

Benign intestinal tumors are rare in children, however we describe an
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the jejunum in a 2-year-old girl who 
presented with an intestinal obstruction. During laparotomy, an annular mass
around the jejunum was resected, from which a histological diagnosis of IMT was
made. A review of the literature for this rare entity emphasizes the importance
of histological confirmation of its benign nature. Because of the risk of local
recurrence, IMT cases should have a long-term follow up.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate which diagnostic test is preferable for the diagnosis of
Helicobacter pylori in patients with gastroduodenal disease.
STUDY DESIGN: H pylori infection was diagnosed prospectively in 101 patients.
Diagnosis of H pylori was made by tests based on five different principles: (1)
culture, (2) direct histologic demonstration, (3) imprint cytology, (4) brushing 
cytology, and (5) gram staining of H pylori. Efficacy of each test was compared.
RESULTS: All the tests were reliable for diagnosing H pylori infection; 73.3% of 
patients showed concordance in at least two tests. All the tests were positive in
> 50% of patients. Significant concordance between brushing and imprint cytology 
was also determined. These two tests have almost similar specificity when
compared to other tests.
CONCLUSION: When patients undergo upper endoscopy, we recommend taking biopsy
specimens for culture and histology. H pylori can be assessed equally well with
all the tests, but imprint and brushing cytology have the advantage of rapid
response, specificity, much lower cost and reproducibility.

OBJECTIVE: To define the cytomorphologic features of clear cell carcinoma (CCC)
of the female genital tract.
STUDY DESIGN: The study consisted of four CCCs of the female genital tract in
which clinical and histologic confirmation had been done. Cytologic findings were
evaluated with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) stain of three cases of fine needle
aspiration (FNA) material and peritoneal fluid cytology. All the FNA materials
were obtained from metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes.
RESULTS: We report here the cytomorphologic features of three FNA biopsies and
peritoneal fluid cytology from four patients. Primary tumors from patients with
aspiration material from supraclavicular lymph nodes were located in the ovary in
two patients and vagina in one. The peritoneal fluid cytology was obtained from a
patient with uterine cervical tumor. Cytologic findings were similar in all
preparations. The cells had abundant, pale, finely vacuolated cytoplasm with
indistinct cytoplasmic membranes. The nuclei were round to oval, with fine
chromatin. The characteristic feature of CCC of the genital tract was basement
membrane-like substance. This hyaline extracellular material stained pinkish to
purple-red in MGG preparations and was frequently observed within the cancer cell
clusters. In ascitic fluid, psammoma bodies were also observed.
CONCLUSION: The cytomorphologic characteristics of CCC of the genital tract are
distinctive, and the entity may easily be diagnosed even at metastatic locations.

Microscopic nephrocalcinosis and hypercalciuria in nephrotic syndrome.

Mocan H(1), Yildiran A, Camlibel T, Kuzey GM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, American Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

Focal calcification is an occasional tubular abnormality seen in minimal-change
nephrotic syndrome. Nephrocalcinosis was also reported in premature infants as a 
consequence of hypercalciuria resulting from long-term furosemide therapy. We
describe 4 nephrotic children (3 minimal change, 1 diffuse proliferative
glomerulonephritis) with transient hypercalciuria and intraluminal calcifications
in renal histopathological specimens without radiologic evidence of renal
calcification. These children were resistant to corticosteroid therapy and were
receiving furosemide therapy along with albumin for management of oedema. Two of 
the children also had urinary infection. We were concerned that children with
nephrotic syndrome are at risk for nephrocalcinosis, and urinary calcium and pH
should be monitored carefully during prolonged furosemide use, especially in
children with nephrotic syndrome with reduced initial responsiveness to
corticosteroid therapy. HUM PATHOL 31:1363:1367.

Oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland: report of a case with
DNA ploidy analysis and review of the literature.

Deveci MS(1), Deveci G, Günhan O, Finci R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Gülhane Military Medical Academy and School of
Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.

A 44-year-old female presented with a painful mass in the left parotid gland.
Histologic examination revealed the characteristic picture of oncocytic
mucoepidermoid carcinoma (OMEC) composed mainly of sheets of oncocytic cells with
uniform nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, focally smaller epidermoid cells
surrounding poorly formed glandular spaces, and a few cystic structures lined by 
well-differentiated mucous cells with intracytoplasmic mucin. Immunohistochemical
staining with antimitochondrial antibody showed granular cytoplasmic positivity
in oncocytic cells. The resulting histogram for DNA ploidy analysis was of
diploid type. OMEC of the parotid gland is a recently described rare neoplasm.
Only six cases have been previously reported in the literature. For an accurate
approach in the management of patients, OMEC should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of oncocytic lesions of the parotid gland, most of which
are benign.

Stereologically estimated mean nuclear volume and histopathologic malignancy
grading as predictors of disease extent in non-small cell lung carcinoma.

Sagol O(1), Kargi A, Ozkal S.

Author information:

Turkey. ozgul.sagol@deu.edu.tr

The aim of this study was to investigate the value of the architectural grade,
cytologic atypia, mitotic counts and stereologically estimated mean nuclear
volume in predicting the stage of disease in non-small cell lung carcinomas.
Hematoxylin-Eosin-stained sections from 53 non-small cell lung carcinomas were
evaluated in terms of the morphologic and morphometric features mentioned above. 
Mean nuclear volume was estimated stereologically. Operable and inoperable tumor 
stages were compared concerning the parameters examined. There was no significant
difference between operable and inoperable tumor stages in terms of the
architectural grade in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas,
although we found a positive correlation between architectural grades and
increasing stages in SCC. Significant differences were found concerning atypia,
mitosis grades, and the score combining both variables (C2) when comparing
operable with inoperable tumor stages in squamous cell carcinomas but not in
adenocarcinomas (Chi square, p = 0.013, p = 0.008 and p = 0.008 for squamous cell
carcinomas respectively). The mean nuclear volumes of tumor cells in both
squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas showed statistically significant
differences between operable and inoperable stages (p = 0.05 and 0.02
respectively). We conclude that an assessment of the proliferative activity and
the degree of cell atypia, as well as an estimation of mean nuclear volume in
conjunction with architectural grade, may contribute to predicting the extent of 
the disease and outcome, particularly in SCC. On the other hand, only mean
nuclear volume appears to be a useful parameter for determining the course of the
disease in adenocarcinomas.

Intraglomerular microlesions in renal angiomyolipoma.

Kiliçaslan I(1), Güllüoglu MG, Dogan O, Uysal V.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University,
Istanbul, Turkey.

A unique case of bilateral multiple intrarenal angiomyolipomas in a 21-year-old
woman with tuberous sclerosis is reported. The microscopic examination showed
peculiar intraglomerular microlesions, epithelioid areas, microscopic foci of
renal cell carcinoma and renal cysts, and the classical features of
angiomyolipoma lesion. HMB-45 positivity was detected within some nodules and
epithelioid areas. Intraglomerular microlesions were composed of adipose and
smooth-muscle cells within the glomerular capillary tuft. These lesions, which
were continuous with the capillary tuft, did not show any attachment to the
Bowman's capsule. These findings suggest that these are not a consequence of an
infiltration from the outside but were originated from inside the glomerulus. The
simultaneous presence of multiple angiomyolipoma nodules either inside or outside
the glomeruli, multifocality and bilaterality of these lesions, together with the
HMB-45 positivity and the finding of scattered epithelioid areas supports the
theory that there is a progenitor cell giving origin to all these lesions, the
cell which has been named as perivascular epithelioid cell by most authors.

A pancreatic endocrine tumour arising within a serous cystadenoma is reported. A 
49 year old woman was admitted with a history of epigastric pain, nausea,
vomiting, and weight loss of two months duration. She had been diabetic for 12
years. An epigastric mass was palpated in the physical examination, and computed 
tomography revealed a multiloculated cystic lesion in the pancreas. Pathological 
examination of the pancreatic tumour revealed the coexistence of a serous
cystadenoma and an endocrine tumour. The endocrine tumour, which was located
inside the serous cystadenoma, was 1 cm in diameter. The first case of a serous
cystadenoma of the pancreas containing a pancreatic endocrine tumour was reported
in the literature recently. This paper reports another incidentally found
pancreatic endocrine tumour arising within a serous cystadenoma.

Intra-hospital use of a telepathology system.

Ongürü O(1), Celasun B.

Author information: 
(1)Gülhane Medical Military Academy, Department of Pathology Etlik, Ankara,
06018, Turkey.

Utilization of telepathology systems to cover distant geographical areas has
increased recently. However, the potential usefulness of similar systems for
closer distances does not seem to be widely appreciated. In this study, we
present data on the use of a simple telepathology system connecting the pathology
department and the intra-operative consultation room within the operating
theaters of the hospital. Ninety-eight frozen section cases from a past period
have been re-evaluated using a real-time setup. Forty-eight of the cases have
been re-evaluated in the customary fashion; allowing both ends to communicate and
cooperate freely. Fifty of the cases, however, were evaluated by the consultant
while the operating room end behaved like a robot; moving the stage of the
microscope, changing and focusing the objectives. The deferral rate was lower
than the original frozen section evaluations. Overall, the sensitivity was 100%, 
specificity 98%, negative predictive value 96, 5% and positive predictive value
100%. No significant difference was found for the diagnostic performances between
the cooperative and robotic simulation methods.Our results strengthen the belief 
that telepathology is a valuable tool in offering pathology services to remote
areas. The far side of a hospital building can also be a remote area and a low
cost system can be helpful for intraoperative consultations. Educational value of
such a system is also commendable.

The interaction of trichomonas vaginalis with epithelial cells, polymorphonuclear
leucocytes and erythrocytes on vaginal smears: light microscopic observation.

Demirezen S(1), Safi Z, Beksaç S.

Author information: 
(1)Hacettepe University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, Beytepe,
Ankara, Turkey.

In this study, vaginal smears taken from 400 patients were examined cytologically
using the Papanicolaou technique. Twenty of the 400 patients were detected as
harbouring Trichomonas vaginalis. The interactions of T. vaginalis with
epithelial cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) and erythrocytes were
determined at light microscopic level. It was observed that T. vaginalis were
juxtaposed to the epithelial cells and changed shape according to the contours of
the epithelial cell revealing the cytopathic effect of trichomonads on epithelial
cells. Trichomonads attached to PMNLs produced pseudopodia to phagocytose the
cells. Occasionally an amoeboid shaped T. vaginalis organism was seen trailed by 
a row of PMNLs. This light microscopic study supports the production by
trichomonads of a chemotactic factor for PMNLs. Phagocytosed erythrocytes were
also seen in the cytoplasm of T. vaginalis, suggesting the need for the patient
to be tested for anaemia.

The aim of this study was to underline the frequently seen problems in diagnosing
the lesions seen in the hyperplasia-carcinoma sequence by evaluating the
variances between the observers. Four pathologists re-evaluated 137 endometrial
biopsies and grouped them into diagnostic categories. The results were analyzed
by Kappa statistics. Full agreement was reached in 89 cases (64.96%), with Kappa 
values ranging between 0.63-0.74. Three observers rendered the same diagnosis in 
34 (24.81%) cases, and only one pathologist disagreed. Two or more observers held
different views in 16 cases (10.95%). The problem areas were as follows: criteria
distinguishing simple hyperplasia from other benign lesions, discrimination
between atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma, and decision-making regarding the
presence of atypia. There was a tendency towards overdiagnosis of hyperplasia in 
our department. Since the progression to carcinoma is a sequential event,
borderline cases will exist if categories based on simple and clear cut off
points are not defined.

In the present study, we determined and compared the distribution and mean
diameters of fiber in the cremaster muscles (CM) of boys with either inguinal
hernia (IH) or undescended testis (UT). Samples of CM were obtained from 20
patients (10 boys with IH, and 10 boys with UT) of similar age. The CM muscles of
two boys each, without inguinal pathology, were sampled during autopsy. Sections 
were stained for oxidative and glycolytic enzymes, as well as for ATP-ase
reactions after acid (pH: 4.6) and alkaline (pH: 10.6) preincubations. Specimens 
were also analyzed morphometrically using a KONTRON 400 computerized image
analysis system. The Mann- Whitney U test was applied to compare the percentages 
of fiber types and mean diameters of fibers according to the types of the CM of
boys with IH or UT. In boys, the CM is mainly composed of type 1 fibers. The CMs 
of patients with UT reveal alterations of neurogenic origin. Although both type 1
and type 2 fibers reveal alterations, type 2 fibers appear to be affected more
profoundly and characterized by significantly decreased mean diameters.
Significantly decreased mean diameters of type 2 fibers in CM may support disuse,
lack of sensitivity to the hormonal influences, or an alteration in the
corticospinal tracts of boys with UT.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Dicle,
Diyarbakir, Turkey.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent used against various
human malignancies. However, it induces nephrotoxicity, a severe side effect in
which oxygen free radicals have been implicated to play an important role. The
effect of allopurinol (Allp) given in a dose of 50 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)
for five days was examined on induced nephrotoxicity by a single dose of 5 mg/kg 
CDDP intraperitoneally (i.p.) in male wistar rats. Serum creatinine and blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations were found significantly higher in the group
given both Allp and CDDP than in the group given CDDP alone, p < 0.001, and
histopathological examination showed more excessive degree of proximal tubular
necrosis in the kidneys of animals given CDDP plus Allp than in those treated
with CDDP alone. Increased renal lipid peroxidation, p < 0.001 associated with
these pathological alterations suggested that oxidative stress may be involved in
the potentiation of CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity by Allp.

Increased cell proliferation and R.Msp1 fragmentation induced by
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in rat testes related to the gene imprinting mechanism.

Ozdemir O(1), Bulut HE, Korkmaz M, Onarlioglu B, Colak A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Cumhuriyet
University, Sivas, Turkey. ozdemiro@cumhuriyet.edu.tr

DNA methylation is one of the crucial mechanisms for cellular and tissue
differentiation during developmental stages in mammals. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a
specific cytosine DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor, is known to cause DNA
hypomethylation in CpG, CpNpG and CCGG sequences. Therefore the present study was
designed to determine the effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on the germinal cells
of the adult rat testicular tissue. Rat testicular tissues from the
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treated experimental and non-treated control groups were
processed for light microscopy and also for genomic DNA isolation assays. The
isolated genomic DNAs were digested with R.Msp1 in order to determine the methyl 
pattern differences in the enzyme cognate CCGG sequence. Testicular tissues from 
treated rats showed increased cell proliferation when investigated at the light
microscopical level. On the other hand, genomic DNA of these proliferative tissue
showed high fragmentation sizes of R.Msp1 digestion when compared to controls.
While the R.Msp1 digested control group DNA fragmentation condensed at
approximately 4700-5100 bps size, the experimental group DNA fragmentation was
condensed at 700-900 bps size. In addition, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine has effects on
increased cell proliferation via the loss of somatic de novo gene imprinting.
These results imply that abnormally imprinted normal somatic cells in mammals are
susceptible to epigenetic modification. These results also suggest that the
genomic DNA of testicular tissues from control rats is resistant to R.Msp1 while 
DNA from the experimental group testicular cells demonstrating high proliferation
rate could not resist to R.Msp1 digestion due to DNA hypomethylation in CCGG
sequence. In conclusion, it could be suggested that the reversal of gene
imprinting in germinal cells may cause an increased cellular proliferation and
R.Msp1 fragmentation when induced by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

Relationship between FIGO grade and AgNOR, S100-positive langerhans cells in
endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Elagöz S(1), Aricí DS, Aker H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas,
Turkey.

Cell kinetic information is an important adjuvant to histological grading in some
malignant tumors. In the current study, 20 endometrial adenocarcinomas were
graded according to the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) and nuclear grading system and the expression of silver-stained
nucleolar organizer regions (AgNOR) and S100-positive Langerhans cells were
determined. According to the FIGO grade, eight patients were in grade 1, seven
were in grade 2 and five were in grade 3. Nuclear grade 1, 2 and 3 was determined
in six, eight and six cases, respectively. Although an overlap was seen in some
grade 2 and 3 cases, AgNOR counts were the highest in grade 3. S100-positive
Langerhans cells were depleted when the grades elevated. It is concluded that
AgNOR and Langerhans cells can be correlated with grades. Further studies,
including survival data of the patients, could be performed and AgNOR and
Langerhans cells can be correlated with prognosis.

The distribution of extracellular matrix proteins and CD44S expression in human
astrocytomas.

Author information:

Aims of the study were: 1. to establish the prevalence of CD44 protein expression
in human astrocytomas; 2. to compare the distribution of the extracellular matrix
in these tumors; 3. to investigate the relation between CD 44, the extracellular 
matrix proteins and the histological grade of the tumor. CD44, Type IV Collagen
(Col IV), Laminin (LN), Fibronectin (FN), and Tenascin (TN) expression were
detected by immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
samples of 52 astrocytic tumors: 35 glioblastomas (GB), 7 Anaplastic astrocytomas
(AA) and 10 astrocytomas (A). The localization of Col IV was observed in the
basement membrane of the vessel walls in most of the astrocytomas (88.4%) with a 
similar pattern obtained with LN staining. 7 of 10 A (70%), 2 of 7 AA (28%) and 9
of 35 GB (25.7%) showed LN positivity. There was a negative correlation between
LN expression and tumor grade (p=0.03). FN was either localized in the basement
membrane or showed thick multi-layered immunoreactivity of the vessel walls. FN
expression was seen in 6 A (60%), 4 AA (57%) and all of 35 GB (100%). The FN
distribution was not uniform and its staining intensity showed decrease in GB. 3A
(30%), 3 AA (42%), 27 GB (77.1%) showed TN expression in the vessel walls and in 
some tumor cells of 19 GBs. TN expression was positively correlated with the
degree of vascular endothelial proliferation in GB (p<0.05). The expression of
CD44s wasseen as plasma membrane positivity of glioma cells in 5 of 10A (50%), 3 
of 7AA (42.3%) and 29 of 35 GB (82.8%). The intensity of immunoreaction was quite
strong especially near the vessels. There was a good correlation between TN and
CD44s expression in human astrocytic tumors (p=0.005). No relationship was
observed between GFAP, ECM proteins and CD44s expression. Both CD44s and TN
expression showed increase with malignancy in astrocytomas. These findings
indicated that the histological malignancy of the astrocytomas was correlated
with expression of TN and CD44s. It was suggested that in astrocytomas there was 
a biological relationship only between CD44 and TN, but none with the other ECM
proteins. TN may play a role in angiogenesis in human astrocytic tumors.

A scholarship project for the children of leprosy patients in Turkey.

Saylan T(1), Karadeniz A, Iyier N, Soydan M, Pamuk D.

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul Leprosy Hospital, Bakirköy, Turkey.

Most of the leprosy patients in Turkey live in the rural areas of Eastern and
South-Eastern Anatolia. Those living in the suburbs of the big cities of the
Western parts of the country have come there by immigration. Nearly all patients 
are very poor; they have no land, or only a small amount of soil for cultivation.
The incidence of deformities in our patients is high, excluding them from regular
employment and a source of income. In Turkey, it is obligatory to attend primary 
school, but after that education has to be paid for, and the poor families of
leprosy patients find it difficult to continue the education of their children.
As the 'Society for the Struggle Against Leprosy', based in the Istanbul Leprosy 
Hospital at Bakirköy, we have developed a project to enable patients to continue 
sending their children to school, whilst at the same time asking the mothers to
seek advice and guidance on family planning. The outset objective of this project
was to enable children and young people, who otherwise have almost no chance of
continuing education, to pursue education at secondary, high school and
university levels. It was envisaged that in the long term educated children would
be able to find a job and provide effective care and support for parents and
other members of the family. This paper describes the administrative and other
measures adopted and the results of the project from 1995 to 1998, during which a
total of 545 children have been supported at an overall cost of US$107,378. The
scholarship project has so far been remarkably successful in Turkey and it is
hoped that it may provide a model for similar approaches in other countries. An
unexpected and extremely encouraging finding has been that females now exceed
males in this project and are increasing at all levels, including university
entrance.

Myelolipoma is a tumor-like growth composed of mature fat tissue and bone marrow 
elements. It occurs in the adrenal gland or as an isolated soft tissue mass. It
may be associated with endocrine disorders such as hermaphroditism, Cushing's
disease, Addison's disease and obesity of unknown cause. These lesions rarely
measure more than 5 cm in diameter, although giant tumors have been reported in
the literature. The fifth largest surgically resected adrenal myelolipoma in the 
literature is reported and its clinical associations and, macroscopic and
microscopic features are discussed.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for genetic characterization of 45
samples taken from the city of Elaziğ in Turkey. The polymorphism at the human
leukocyte antigen DQalpha locus was detected. Allele and genotype frequencies
were determined for unrelated individuals at this locus. Laboratory analyses were
done by PCR amplification of DNA. Hybridization to allele specific
oligonucleotide probes was performed using a reversed dot-blot typing method. The
collected genotype and allele frequencies have been tested, and a comparison was 
made with other population surveys of this locus. Allele frequencies ranged from 
3.3% (allele 1.3) to 36.7% (allele 4), with a discrimination power of 0.92. No
deviation was seen from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the findings.

defects is time-consuming, cumbersome, and requires complicated instrumentation. 
To overcome the difficulties encountered during isolation and purification of
mtDNA, the authors developed an alternative method based on polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification of whole mtDNA genome. In this study, they show that
PCR-amplified and fluorescein-labeled mtDNA probe makes it possible, through
Southern blot analysis, to identify quantitative defect of mtDNA. The results
indicate that mtDNA probe can be prepared rapidly by PCR amplification and used
to determine the level of mtDNA in the patients with mitochondrial diseases.

In this study we examined the in vitro vacuolating cytotoxic activity of
Helicobacter pylori, which is a gram-negative microaerophilic curved bacterium
and a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric ulcer. A vacuolating
cytotoxin assay was performed to assess the vacuolating activity of 40 strains
(20 gastritis, 11 gastric ulcer, and 9 duodenal ulcer), which were obtained from 
patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The Vero cell line was used
in the cytotoxic assay. Of the 40 isolates, 24 (12 gastritis, 6 gastric ulcer, 6 
duodenal ulcer) were cytotoxic for the Vero cell line at 1:4 and 1:8 dilutions.
Thus, vacuolating cytotoxin of H. pylori affects the Vero cell line, but it seems
there is no correlation between the positivity of the strains and the risk of any
particular H. pylori disease.

School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. isindogan@hotmail.com

A case of ossifying fasciitis occurring in the left femoral region of a
57-year-old male is reported. The patient complained of pain in his left lower
extremity which was the site of previous catheterization. During a left
femoropopliteal by-pass, a firm and cylindric mass measuring 5 x 3 x 2.5 cm in
size was found and extracted from the left groin. Histologically, a reactional
lymph node and an irregularly shaped lesion extended into the perinodal fat
tissue which is composed of proliferating fibroblasts with occasional mitotic
activity. Within this fibroblastic proliferation, immature woven bone composed of
osteoid with calcification and chondroid differentiation were seen. Metaplastic
bone is an uncommon finding in cases of nodular fasciitis, parosteal fasciitis,
cranial fasciitis and florid reactive periostitis. Ossifying fasciitis is known
as an uncommon variant of nodular fasciitis. It is an uncommon post-traumatic
benign lesion of subcutaneous tissue with an unclear etiology of ossification
which is neither related with a bony structure nor contains any muscle tissue.
This lesion has been reported only once previously, in the femoral region after a
trauma history of catheterization.

Effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on neuronal migration, neuronogenesis and
brain myelination in the mice brain.

Ozer E(1), Sarioglu S, Güre A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylül University School of Medicine, Izmir,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: One of the most severe consequences of maternal alcohol consumption
is the damage to the developing central nervous system.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To evaluate the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on
neuronal migration, neuronogenesis and myelination in the brain, pregnant BALB/C 
mice were maintained on either liquid diets containing ethanol (12 g/kg body
weight) beginning on gestation day 6 or isocoloric diet (control group). The dams
were sacrificed on gestation day 17 and the brain sections of the pups were
analyzed using immunohistochemical method to evaluate the number of neurons,
oligodendrioglial expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and neuronal
expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM).
RESULTS: Ethanol-exposed pups revealed significantly weaker expression of MBP
compared to the control group. In contrast, no significant difference of NCAM
expression and neuronal cell count were present between ethanol-exposed pups and 
the control group.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that alcohol exposure affects the level of MBP
expression, consequently causing a reduction in brain myelination that may lead
to neuronal dysfunction. The ineffectiveness of prenatal alcohol exposure on the 
number of neurons in contrast to the previous reports might be due to the
adequate sampling of areas for cell counting. Although there is a view that NCAM 
is involved both directly and indirectly in neuronal cell migration, we speculate
that alcohol neuroembryotoxicity uncouples this relationship. Other adhesion
molecules, such as L1, or extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin, would
be other candidates for investigation.

The aim of the present study was to immunohistochemically investigate the
prognostic value of neovascularization (expressed as microvessel count-MVC) and
tumor cell proliferation (expressed as PCNA labeling index PLI and Ki-67 labeling
index KLI) in gastric adenocarcinoma. Correlations with clinicopathologic
features were also evaluated. Tumor specimens from 74 patients diagnosed as
gastric adenocarcinoma were included in this study. Formalin fixed, paraffin
embedded tissue sections stained immunohistochemically with F-VIII, PC10 and
MIB-1 monoclonal antibodies. By ocular grid subdivided into 100 areas, number of 
microvessels and PC10, MIB-1 positive and negative cells were counted at x400
magnification. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method and cox regression analysis
were used for statistical analysis. The results showed that, MVC and PLI had a
significant correlation with invasion and lymph node metastasis. The prognosis
was significantly worse in patients with high MVC (>14 ) and with high PLI
(>49%). However any relationship was not observed between KLI (38%) and
clinicopathologic parameters, so KLI failed to predict the prognosis. Cox model
showed that, MVC and PLI were independent prognostic variables. Ki-67 labeling
index in gastric carcinomas has no prognostic relevance. However, the evaluation 
of microvessel count and proliferating cell nuclear antigen index in gastric
carcinomas could be reliable indicators of prognosis.

Serum levels of the soluble adhesion molecules in patients with malignant
melanoma.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Basic Oncology, Oncology Institute, Capa, Istanbul, 34390,
Turkey.

The incidence of malignant melanoma has been steadily increasing over the past
decades. CD 44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is implicated in a number of
adhesive and migratory events. Downregulation of CD 44 is implicated in the
metastatic process. P-Selectin is a member of the selectin family of cell surface
molecules. The levels of P-Selectin in biological fluids may be elevated in
subjects with a variety of pathological conditions. In malignant melanoma,
elevation of the plasma level of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(sICAM-1) has been associated with a reduction in disease-free survival. This
study was performed to investigate the differences in the serum concentrations of
the adhesion molecules in patients with malignant melanoma. The study group
consisted of 52 patients with malignant melanoma and 20 healthy subjects. No
meaningful difference was observed for P-selectin and sICAM 1 levels. A
statistically significant decrease was observed in the cancer patients for serum 
CD 44 levels.

Molecular analysis of HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 polymorphism in Turkey.

Saruhan-Direskeneli G(1), Uyar FA, Bakar S, Eraksoy M.

Author information: 
(1)Istanbul University, Electro-Neurophysiology Research and Application Centre, 
Turkey. gsaruhan@istanbul.edu.tr

We report the evaluation of MHC class II polymorphism in the population of
Turkey. HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 have been investigated by polymerase chain
reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridisations (PCR/SSO) and
sequence-specific priming (SSP) in 250 randomly selected healthy individuals. We 
also report the allelic distribution of these genes. The most frequent alleles
detected were DRB1*1101 (0.104), *0301 (0.092), *0701 (0.090), DQA1*0501 (0.334),
*0102 (0.164) and *03 (0.148) and DQB1*0301 (0.256), *02 (0.164), *0302 (0.128). 
The frequent 'putative' three-locus haplotypes carry the most frequent alleles at
these loci. The most frequently detected class II "haplotypes" are DRB1*1101
DQA1*0501 DQB1*0301 (0.100), DRB1*0301 DQA1*0501 DQB1*02 (0.092) and DRB1*0701
DQA1*0201 DQB1*02 (0.072). The distribution of alleles and 'putative' haplotypes 
has shown common features with other Mediterranean populations. The results
extend the HLA map to another Mediterranean country and provide a database for
further HLA-disease association studies and transplantation applications.

Imprint cytology in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori. Does imprinting damage 
the biopsy specimen?

School, Izmit, Turkey. acubukcu@superonline.com

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of imprint cytology in the diagnosis of
Helicobacter pylori infection and whether it damages the biopsy specimen for
subsequent histologic examination.
STUDY DESIGN: Two antral biopsies were taken from 76 patients with dyspeptic
symptoms undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Imprint cytology was made
from the first specimen. This specimen was fixed in 10% formalin and sent for
histopathologic examination. The second specimen was directly fixed in 10%
formalin for routine histopathologic examination without being used for an
imprint. The imprint smears were examined by cytopathologists. The biopsy
specimens were examined by pathologists who did not know which specimens were
used for the imprints.
RESULTS: H pylori was seen in smears from 55 (72%) patients and in both biopsy
specimens from the same patients. The pathologists could not recognize the biopsy
specimens from which the imprints were made. Concordance between imprint cytology
and histopathology was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Imprint cytology is a suitable test for H pylori diagnosis, and
imprints do not adversely affect the quality of the biopsy specimen.

Intracranial meningeal tumours in childhood: a clinicopathologic study including 
MIB-1 immunohistochemistry.

Demirtaş E(1), Erşahin Y, Yilmaz F, Mutluer S, Veral A.

Author information:

Primary tumours of the meninges with a relatively high tendency for malignant
behaviour are uncommon in childhood. This study concerns 18 cases of meningeal
tumours in children under the age of 16, of which 13 were meningiomas and five
were other tumours arising in the meninges. Meningiomas showed a preponderance in
females as in adult series, and the majority were supratentorial in localisation.
The percentage of meningeal tumours and meningiomas among all brain tumours in
our centre were 3.72% and 2.69%, respectively. Four out of 13 meningiomas were
fibroblastic, four were transitional, one was meningothelial, two were
psammomatous and two were papillary meningiomas. Seven (38.8%) out of 18 tumours 
showed anaplastic features, including two papillary meningiomas, two
hemangiopericytomas, one mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, one pleomorphic sarcoma and 
one anaplastic meningeal tumour. Papillary meningiomas with
hemangiopericytoma-like solid areas were seen frequently in our cases (15.3%).
Meningoangiomatosis was associated with two meningeal tumours. MIB1 (Ki-67)
labelling indices (LIs) ranged between 0% and 13.6% (mean 1.83%) in benign, and
between 1% and 20% (mean 7.2%) in malignant tumour, including papillary
meningiomas. Mean MIB-1 LIs were 5.61% and 1.14% in non-recurrent and recurrent
cases, respectively. MIB-1 LIs showed significant differences between benign and 
malignant meningeal tumours but no significant correlation either with prognosis 
or recurrence. Despite the fact that brain tumours are among the most common
neoplasms of childhood, meningeal tumours are rare lesions, accounting for less
than 2% of published series of intracranial neoplasms in childhood [5, 8, 18, 24,
30, 32]. It has been suggested that the clinical and pathological characteristics
of meningiomas in this age group differ from those of adults [14, 18, 24, 45].
Besides meningiomas, there are a few reports of other meningeal tumours in
childhood and difficulties in differential diagnosis may arise within this group,
especially in anaplastic tumours [11, 13, 32, 44, 46]. One of the major problems 
in meningiomas and some tumours arising in the meninges is the discordance that
arises between the histologic appearance of the tumour and behaviour [4]. Several
studies have attempted to determine the proliferation potential of meningiomas,
including immunohistochemical labelling with monoclonal antibodies to Ki-67,
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR); flow
cytometric DNA analysis; or argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs)
counting [9, 10, 15, 19, 22, 26, 31, 35, 53]. The studies concerning
proliferation markers have contradictory results [9, 10, 15, 26, 31, 42, 53].
MIB-1 detects the same or a similar epitope as the original antibody Ki-67 and
reacts with a proliferation associated antigen expressed in all active parts of
the cell cycle, G1, S, G2 and M (mitosis), but not in the G0 or quiescent phases 
[7]. In this study we examined the clinicopathological characteristics and MIB1
values of 18 meningeal tumours in children under the age of 16 years within the
last 25 years (from 1970 to 1995).

The clinical features of merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and
merosin-deficient CMD are well known, with those of merosin-deficient CMD being
more severe. Whether the severity of histopathological findings correlates with
these clinical features remains unanswered. In this study, the clinical and
histopathological findings of 39 merosin-deficient and 37 merosin-positive CMD
patients were compared. Merosin-deficient CMD patients were found to be younger, 
with earlier onset of symptoms, age of diagnosis, and a more severe clinical
state (reflecting maximum motor capacity and contractures). On histopathological 
evaluation, endomysial fibrosis, perimysial fibrosis, and histopathological state
(reflecting fibrosis, adiposis, necrosis, and variation in fiber size) were more 
severe in merosin-deficient CMD. There was a correlation between clinical and
histopathological states only in merosin-deficient CMD.

Blastomatous tumor with teratoid features of nasal cavity: report of a case and
review of the literature.

Deveci MS(1), Deveci G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Gülhane Military Medical Academy, School of Medicine,
Ankara, Turkey.

A case of blastomatous tumor with teratoid features is presented. The polypoid
mass was observed in the left nasal cavity of a 72-year-old man. Histologically, 
the lesion was composed of neuroepithelial cells with blastomatous appearance,
cystic squamous nests filled with keratin materials, many mucous glands, complex 
tubular and glandular structures with edematous fibroblastic stroma. Sinonasal
neoplasms including teratoid components and immature neuroepithelium are
exceedingly rare. We suggest that the term 'immature teratoma' is more suitable
than blastoma or blastomatous tumor when there is no carcinomatous or sarcomatous
component besides the immature neuroepithelium and teratoid elements.

Menstrual cycle dependent variability for serum tumor markers CEA, AFP, CA 19-9, 
CA 125 and CA 15-3 in healthy women.

Erbağci AB(1), Yilmaz N, Kutlar I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine,
University of Gaziantep, Turkey. erbagci@gantep.edu.tr

Information on menstrual cycle dependent variation of tumor markers in healthy
women is a subject of diagnostic efficiency and has an impact in elucidating the 
normal function of these markers. In this study midfollicular and midluteal
concentrations of serum CEA, AFP, CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3 and their relations
with LH, FSH, prolactin, estradiol and progesterone were evaluated during
ovulatory cycles in a group of 23 healthy female individuals. Samples were
collected on the 7th and 21st day of the same menstrual cycle. Tumor marker and
hormone concentrations were determined with chemiluminescence or
electrochemiluminescence EIA methods. A significant phase-dependent difference
was observed for CA 15-3, midluteal concentrations (mean +/- SEM; 26.33 +/- 1.56 
U/ml) higher than the midfollicular (mean +/- SEM; 19.27 +/- 1.49 U/ml)
concentrations (p < 0.001). But an obvious difference for other tumor markers
investigated did not exist. Significant correlations of follicular and luteal CA 
125 levels with body mass index of the subjects were observed (r:0.52, p < 0.05
and r:0.57, p < 0.005, respectively). CA 15-3 antigen is a product of the MUC-1
gene which is expressed in abundance by endometrial epithelial cells in the
secretory phase of the menstrual cycle which may be the potential source of
variability. The association of CA 125 levels with obesity suggests a possible
role of adipose tissue in CA 125 metabolism. In conclusion our data suggest that 
in healthy women serum CA 15-3 levels are significantly elevated in the midluteal
phase of the menstrual cycle compared to midfollicular phase. Therefore,
consideration of menstrual cycle dependent variability for CA 15-3 appears
indicated in interpretation of individual results.

(1)Department of Pathology, Uludag University, Gorukle-Bursa, Turkey.

A 60-year-old Turkish woman presented with a left breast mass, which was
considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. By the end of the treatment cycles, the 
tumor had decreased in size, and the patient underwent modified radical
mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Pathologic examination of the
tumor revealed a small cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features confirmed by
immunohistochemical stains. Multiple axillary lymph nodes were involved by
metastatic small cell carcinoma carrying the same morphologic characteristics
noted in the primary breast tumor. We hereby present this case as a primary
neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the breast. This entity occurs very rarely
in the breast, and fewer than a dozen cases have been reported in the literature.
Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma of the breast is reportedly a very aggressive
tumor for which no consensus for treatment has yet been drawn.

Clinical importance of correlations between p53 immunoreactivity and
clinicopathological parameters in lung carcinoma.

Many studies have revealed the frequency of p53 abnormalities in lung cancer.
However, clinico-pathological studies of p53 abnormalities have yielded
conflicting results. We examined the p53 immunoreactivity and studied the
correlations of p53 status and clinicopathological parameters in 76 primary lung 
cancers. By using DO-7 antibody, different degrees of p53 immunoreactivity was
detected in 8 of 30 small cell lung cancer (SCLC, 26.6%) and 22 of 46 non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 47.8%), 6 of 19 adenocarcinoma, 16 of 27 epidermoid
carcinoma cases. In the whole group, no correlation was detected between the p53 
status and the histological types of tumor, local tumor invasion, nodal status,
and distant metastasis and patient characteristics, such as age, gender or
smoking habit. P53 status was also found to have no effect on survival. However, 
in the NSCLC group, there was a significantly higher p53 immunoreactivity in
well- and moderately-differentiated tumors (p<0.05). Patients with p53
immunoreactivity had a poor therapeutic response in the whole group. We concluded
that, although p53 immunreactivity may be found in NSCLC, this does not correlate
with clinicopathological parameters except therapeutic response. In SCLC p53
immunreactivity can be negligible.

Our two patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (AlloBMT) had 
both Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In the first
patient, liver enzymes elevated three months after AlloBMT, and GVHD was
diagnosed. Two weeks after the diagnosis of GVHD, HBsAg appeared in his serum. At
that time, liver biopsy was not able to discriminate two disorders, but his
sequential liver biopsies disclosed GVHD. Despite the patient was treated with
cyclosporin A (CsA), he died for chronic GVHD. In contrast to the first patient, 
the second patient had HBsAg prior to GVHD. His liver enzymes deterioration was
detected in the first month after AlloBMT, and reached the highest level in the
third month while withdrawing CsA. In the fifth month he developed
scleradermatous skin changes, and skin biopsy revealed chronic GVHD, whereas
concurrent liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis. This observation
showed that immunosuppressive conditions such as GVHD or its prophylaxis may
affect the appearance of liver pathology caused by HBV, which depends on the time
of GVHD development, and the duration and depth of GVHD prophylaxis.

The 21-aminosteroids (lazaroids) are a new family of steroid compounds that
inhibit lipid peroxidation reactions. They are novel antioxidant agents, which
have been shown to have antiproliferative properties on cancer cells and also are
thought to prevent free radical-mediated blood-brain barrier damage. In order to 
understand the effect of lazaroids on glioma, we tested U-83836E and U-74389G at 
doses ranging between 0.1 100 m mM on primary cultures of glioblastoma multiforme
from three patients, rat C6 glioma cell line, and 5 th subculture established
from one of the patients. The effects of both compounds on cell proliferation
were determined using 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. U-83836E in the primary cultures was found to
have 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 ) of 6.30, 6.75 and 6.50 m mM,
respectively. The IC50 value of U-74389G was calculated as 91 m mM in only one of
the patients. On C6 glioma cells, while the IC50 of U-83836E was 45 m mM,
U-74389G showed no cytotoxic effect. On the 5 th subculture, U-83836E had an IC50
of 37.5 m mM, but the cytotoxic effects of U-74389G was less than in that of the 
primary culture. In conclusion, these compounds were found to be more cytotoxic
in primary culture than the cell lines and there were also differences between
their members in the inhibition of cell survival.

rat microsomal preparations and soluble fractions fortified with NADPH. These two
substrates and their potential dealkylation metabolite 2-benzothiazolinone were
synthesized and their structures were elucidated by spectral methods. The results
showed that (I) was metabolised to (II), the corresponding alcohol by reduction. 
More alcohol metabolite was observed with microsomes than those obtained with the
soluble fractions. No dealkylation of (I) was observed in the experiments using
both microsomes and soluble fractions. (II) was metabolised to (I), the
corresponding ketone by oxidation. However, compared to the metabolism of (I),
more ketone metabolite was observed with soluble fractions than microsomes. (II) 
was also dealkylated to (III) with only soluble fractions but no dealkylated
metabolites were found in the microsomes. In addition, a common unknown
metabolite was observed with each substrates.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of commonly used non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on oxidative stress and anti-oxidant system.
Sixteen healthy volunteers and 35 patients diagnosed as one of musculoskeletal
disorders were included in the study. Patients were treated with one of the three
NSAIDs (i.e. naproxen, tiaprofenic acid, acemetacin) or paracetamol for 15 days. 
Erythrocyte glutathione S-transferase, erythrocyte and plasma glutathione
peroxidase, and erythrocyte catalase (CAT) activities and plasma malondialdehyde 
level as lipid peroxidation index were detected in the blood samples of the
patients, at the beginning of the study (0 week), after treatment for 15 days
(2nd week), and at the end of 1 week-washout period (3rd week). The most affected
enzyme by NSAIDs was erythrocyte catalase, which tended to increase at the end of
2 weeks treatment, and decrease at the end of 1 week-washout period. In the
groups treated with acemetacin, naproxen and tiaprofenic acid, plasma
malondialdehyde levels were decreased at some extent, but at the end of washout
period a rebound increase was observed in acemetacin group. Our results suggest
that NSAIDs have different influences on oxidative stress and anti-oxidant system
related parameters. These effects seem to be related with the mechanisms of some 
of the adverse effects, which are not well understood yet. Further studies with
larger groups are needed to illuminate the relationship between adverse effects
of NSAIDs and the effects of these drugs on anti-oxidant system, and to clarify
their mechanisms of therapeutic action, as well.

The in vitro effects of new non-steroidal antiinflammatory compounds on
antioxidant system of human erythrocytes.

Orhan H(1), Doğruer DS, Cakir B, Sahin G, Sahin MF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmaceutical Toxicology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.

It has been reported by our group that some benzoxazolone and benzothiazolone
derivatives showed significant antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity
[DOGRUER et al. 1997]. It has been speculated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) can act as the free radical scavengers and possess antioxidant
activity. It is also well documented that oxidative stress can play an important 
role in the side effects of many xenobiotics including NSAIDs. Therefore, in the 
present study, the effects of six of the above mentioned benzoxazolone and
benzothiazolone derivatives bearing 2-pyridylaminocarbonylmetyl moiety at the
position 3 (I) on the antioxidant system-related parameters of human erythrocytes
have been investigated. Diclofenac and nimesulid were also tested in the same
systems as the control, because they are commonly used as NSAIDs. Our results
showed that these compounds made significant changes in the antioxidant system of
human erythrocyte.

Cytoprotective effects of trimetazidine in carmustine cholestasis.

Girgin F(1), Tüzün S, Demir A, Kuralay F, Ozutemiz O, Tanyalcin T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Ege Univ. Medical School, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.

Carmustine [1 ,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea (BCNU)] is an antitumour agent, 
however, its usefulness has been limited by a side effect; which involves
pericholangitis and intrahepatic cholestasis. The primary effects of cholestasis 
is well known; bile flow retention, intracellular Ca++ accumulation and acidosis 
although it may lead to hepatotoxicity by dose-dependent manner. Recent studies
provide evidence that lipoperoxidation (LPO) and alterations in the antioxidant
system may significantly contribute to BCNU induced hepatotoxicity.
Trimetazidine, (1-[2,3,4-Trimethoxy-benzyl] piperazine HCl; TMZ) introduced as an
antianginal compound, is found to exhibit various cytoprotective features by
preserving cellular ATP levels, limiting intracellular acidosis and inorganic
phosphate as well as Na+ and Ca++ accumulation in ischemic cardiac injury. No
study was undertaken to investigate the cytoprotective role of TMZ in cholestatic
injury till today; therefore we initiated this study to investigate if its
cytoprotective features also exhibit in the liver and to characterize further the
cholestatic response to BCNU administration. Male rats were randomly seperated to
control (CONT) (n = 15), BCNU administered (BCNU) (n = 16) and BCNU+TMZ
administered (BCNU+TMZ) (n = 12) groups. The control rats received a single
dosage of 2 ml/kg of corn oil (i.p.) while the BCNU group received a single
dosage of BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.p.) in corn oil. In the BCNU + TMZ group 2,5
mg/kg/day (i.p.) of TMZ was administered for three days. This group also received
BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.p.) in corn oil, 12 hours after the initial dose of TMZ. The
cholestatic effect of BCNU was monitored by stasis markers such as ALP, GGT and
total bilirubin levels. Hepatic TBARS analysis was determined with the modified
method of OKHAWA et al. based on the reaction of lipid peroxides with
thiobarbituric acid. Oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione levels were
measured by the modified enzymatic recycling method of TEARE et al. Statistical
tests were performed using Kruskal Wallis one-way Anova test and posthoc analysis
by Newman-Keuls test. The BCNU group and the BCNU + TMZ group showed significant 
increases (p = 0.029) in hepatic TBARS levels compared to the CONT group; however
the difference between the BCNU and BCNU + TMZ groups in regard to TBARS was not 
significant. BCNU and BCNU + TMZ groups manifested a significant decrease (p =
0.0005) in GSH levels as compared to controls. GSH/GSSG ratios in the BCNU and
BCNU + TMZ group also manifested a significant decrease (p = 0.0013) as compared 
to the CONT group. TMZ administration caused a significant increase in total GSH 
levels (p = 0.0026) in BCNU + TMZ group when compared to the BCNU group. Our
results support the hypothesis that BCNU induced cholestasis partly involves LPO 
revealed by the distinct increase in the content of TBARS in the liver after BCNU
administration. BCNU is a potent inhibitor of GSSG reductase altering the
preservation of the thiol redox balance in the system. As a result, supranormal
concentrations of intracellular GSSG would accumulate in the hepatocyte and the
extrusion of this oxidized compound would require active transport leading to ATP
hydrolysis. This would deplete the energy stores of the cell which would
accelerate further the possible prooxidant status. Although administration of TMZ
did not provoke any significant alterations in LPO, it preserved the total GSH
levels of the cell probably by improving the energy status of the cell by
protection of ATP-producing processes at the mitochondrial level and provision of
the necessary substrates for GSH synthesis. This protective role in the
antioxidant system normalizes the altered GSH levels by BCNU and hence proposes
TMZ to be a promising agent in the cholestatic injury.

The effect of arginine-428 mutation on modulation of activity of human liver
flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) by imipramine and chlorpromazine.

Adali O(1), Carver GC, Philpot RM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.

This study was carried out to investigate the molecular basis for modulation of
recombinant FMO3-catalyzed activity by the tricyclic antidepressants, imipramine 
and chlorpromazine. A mutant of human liver FMO3 (T428R) was formed by
site-directed mutagenesis and characterized along with the native enzyme in order
to elucidate a possible structure-function relationship. Functional properties of
native and T428R human FMO3s were studied with methimazole as substrate. Both
enzymes catalyzed the S-oxidation of methimazole with the same Km value.
Imipramine modulated the activities of the native and T428R human FMO3s
differently; the activity of the native FMO3 was increased at all concentrations,
whereas the activity of the mutant enzyme was inhibited at concentrations above
300 microM. Chlorpromazine activated the native enzyme at all concentrations of
methimazole but activated the mutant enzyme only at high substrate
concentrations. The direction (activation or inhibition) and extend of modulation
of FMO3 activity is not only dependent on the concentration of the modulator, it 
is also dependent on the substrate concentration. This study confirms our
previous findings with FMO1 that position 428 is important in the interaction of 
the FMO with modulators.

Double aortic arch in a Siamese cat.

Yarim M(1), Gültiken ME, Oztürk S, Sahal M, Bumin A.

Author information: 
(1)University of Ankara, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Pathology,
Diskapi, Turkey.

A double aortic arch is described in an 8-week-old female Siamese cat. In this
case a vascular ring anomaly consistent with a double aortic arch is described in
a cat. Stridor and dysphagia were noted in the cat. Radiography showed an
esophageal dilation, with constriction at the fifth intercostal space. At
necropsy, the esophagus and trachea were constricted at the base of the heart.
The cause of the constriction of both the esophagus and trachea was a vascular
ring formed by well-developed right and left aortic arches. The ascending aorta
divided into two asymmetrical arches. The right aortic arch was larger than the
left. The origin of the major arteries from the aortic arches were anomalous.

Retrospective analysis of medicolegal cases and evaluation for erectile function.

Ozkara H(1), Aşicioglu F, Alici B, Akkuş E, Hattat H.

Author information: 
(1)University of Istanbul, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty, Sexual Dysfunction Center,
Turkey.

Erectile function (EF) is an important question in lawsuits for divorce, rape,
and damages. In this study, a method to evaluate medicolegal cases is defined,
and the characteristics of the 265 cases screened for EF between 1989 and 1997
were analyzed. Interview, physical examination, psychometric evaluation,
nocturnal penile tumescence, serum hormone levels and blood chemistry,
intracavernosal drug injection, penile Doppler ultrasonography, and
pharmacocavernosometry and pharmacocavernosography tests were used for diagnosis.
The tests performed were selected according to the age of the subject. Of the 265
cases 128 (48.3%) were for divorce, 116 (43.7%) were for rape, and 21 (8%) were
for indemnity relating to lawsuits for damages. In only 7 cases (2.7%) was the
defendant <15 years of age. Organic pathology for erectile dysfunction (ED) was
present in 22% of lawsuits for divorce, 40.5% of lawsuits for rape, and 33.4% of 
lawsuits for damages. Three men in cases of divorce and 2 men after genital
trauma due to traffic accident suffered psychological ED. This study indicates
that lawyers may abuse the assertion of ED in lawsuits for divorce and rape. In
128 divorce cases the defendant was accused of being impotent, but evaluation
proved that 75.8% had normal EF. In lawsuits for rape, 59.5% of defendants had
normal EF although the lawyers of the rapist claimed their clients were impotent.
The investigation, interpretation, and characteristics of medicolegal cases may
differ in countries with different cultures.

Conjunctival melanocytic nevi of childhood.

Kabukçuoğlu S(1), McNutt NS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Osmangazi University Hospital, Eskişehir, Turkey.

Two young patients with conjunctival compound nevi are presented to illustrate
two types of abnormalities that lead to difficulty in distinction of these nevi
from invasive melanomas. In Case 1, inflammation is associated with disruption of
the nevus cell architecture and cytologic atypia. In Case 2, the occurrence of a 
combined nevus (compound and blue nevus types) in the conjunctiva leads to
diagnostic problems. Circumscription of the lesions, lack of mitoses in the
substantia propria, and lack of pagetoid spread of atypical cells in the adjacent
conjunctival epithelium support benign diagnoses in both cases.

Bone marrow involvement is a frequent finding in malignant lymphoma. Bone marrow 
biopsy of the posterior iliac crest is routinely performed for staging. Abnormal 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of bone marrow was also reported to be
indicative of bone marrow involvement. This study included 60 patients with
malignant lymphoma. Unilateral bone marrow biopsy of the posterior iliac crest
was performed. MRI of lumbar spine was studied within 24 hours of bone marrow
biopsy. 22 healthy controls were used for the detection of MRI objectivity during
visual evaluation. In 83% of patients (50/60), biopsy and MRI results agreed
completely. In two patients, histologic sections failed to show any evidence of
bone marrow involvement despite abnormal MRI signals suggestive of involvement.
In three patients, MRI was completely normal despite biopsy proven bone marrow
infiltration. False negativity (3/60) and false positivity (2/60) rates were very
low. Negative biopsy findings with positive or equivocal MRI results should not
exclude bone marrow involvement and needs further evaluation with bilateral or
guided biopsy. Thus, we conclude that MRI of bone marrow is a fairly sensitive,
noninvasive modality and might be of potential value in detecting bone marrow
infiltration in malignant lymphoid neoplasms which can be utilized as a useful
adjunct to standard staging procedures.

Expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein in gastric carcinoma: correlation with
histopathologic characteristics and analysis of Ki-67.

Caddesi 16/8, Mebusevleri Tandogan, Ankara, 06580, Turkey.

Amplification and overexpression of the c-erbB-2 gene has been demonstrated in
several tumors and thought to be important determinants of biologic behaviors of 
carcinomas. In this study, correlation between c-erbB-2 expression und
histopathologic parameters, including proliferative activity of gastric
carcinomas was evaluated. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 62 patients who 
underwent curative resection of gastric carcinoma were analyzed
immunohistochemically for the expression of c-erbB-2 and Ki-67. Strong membrane
staining for c-erbB-2 was detected in 11 of 62 gastric carcinomas (17,7%) and no 
positive reaction was evident in noncancerous tissue. The incidence of c-erbB-2
positivity in intestinal type carcinomas (24,3%) was higher than that of diffuse 
type carcinomas (4,76%). Positive staining for c-erbB-2 was present in one of the
9 (11,1%) early gastric carcinomas and 10 of 53 (18, 8%) advanced gastric
carcinomas. However, no statistically significant relationships were found
between c-erbB-2 expression and histopathologic type, depth on invasion, the
tumor size or lymph node metastases. Among the metastatic lymph nodes, 3 were
positively stained with c-erbB-2 whereas the primary tumors of two cases had been
found to be negative. Additionally, no correlation was found between c-erbB-2
reactivity and proliferative activity of carcinoma cells. The results suggest
that expression of c-erbB-2 protein may occur selectively in intestinal type of
gastric carcinomas. However, c-erbB-2 expression is not a reliable marker of
malignant potential in gastric carcinomas.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. Report of a case diagnosed with fine needle
aspiration cytology.

Kaur AC(1), Dal H, Müezzinoğlu B, Paksoy N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kocaeli, Izmit,
Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a benign, inflammatory
breast disease of unknown etiology. Although it is rare, it frequently presents
in a manner similar to that of breast carcinoma.
CASE: A 41-year-old female developed unilateral idiopathic granulomatous
mastitis, diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. The clinical presentation
and mammographic findings were suspicious for carcinoma. Fine needle aspiration
cytology showed granulomatous inflammation. Histopathologic examination revealed 
a noncaseating, granulomatous lesion. Further clinical, radiologic and laboratory
investigations disclosed no etiology. Therefore, we considered the case to be
idiopathic granulomatous mastitis.
CONCLUSION: Cytologically it may be difficult to distinguish IGM from carcinoma
of the breast. Typical cytologic findings of the lesion are helpful to rule out
cancer. In the differential diagnosis, all known causes of granulomatous changes 
have to be excluded before a diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is
made.

In this study we investigated the long-term effects of 72-h continuous
phototherapy on the reproductive system of newborn rats. The animals' weight,
fertilization rates, and number of newborn and histopathological changes in the
gonads in a normal group not exposed to phototherapy and in the test animals were
compared. At the age of 24 weeks there were no significant differences between
the two groups, apart from the histology of the testicles of the male rats who
were exposed to the phototherapy. The study group showed a significantly reduced 
diameter of the seminiferous tubules when compared to the controls (P < 0.001).
It can be postulated that phototherapy may cause histological degenerative
changes in the structure of the rat's testes, even though there were no changes
in fertilization rates. Further studies are necessary to reveal the effects of
phototherapy on humans and to determine the effects, if any, on fertility.

P53 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in non-tumoral liver
diseases.

Turkey. umutakyol@sim.net.tr

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is known to be involved in the negative regulation 
of cell growth. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is a nuclear
protein and a component of the DNA replication process, is also involved in
growth regulation. Both have been studied as progression markers in various
tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, the aberrant p53
protein and PCNA expressions in non-tumoral liver diseases were investigated.
Using monoclonal antibodies anti-p53 (D07-DAKO) and anti-PCNA (PC10-DAKO), 149
samples were stained, including 10 normal and 10 tumoral control liver tissues.
p53 Overexpression was detected in 52 specimens (35%) whereas PCNA positivity was
found in 96 (64%). There were 21 different pathological entities but most of the 
positive samples could be grouped into four types of diseases; namely,
non-specific reactive hepatitis, steatohepatitis, chronic hepatitis and
cirrhosis. Statistical analyses performed on these groups revealed that p53
positivity was found to be significantly higher in steatohepatitis (P < 0.05),
while PCNA positivity did not show any statistical significance. The number of
samples showing both p53 and PCNA positivity was 42 but their coexistence was not
found to be significant. Certain cytological alterations like nuclear
pleomorphism, steatosis and cholestasis, in addition to necroinflammatory
activity, were evaluated for their possible impact on p53 and/or PCNA positivity.
Necroinflammatory activity in steatohepatitis and steatosis in chronic hepatitis 
was found to be significant for p53 positivity (P < 0.05). In contrast, nuclear
pleomorphism in non-specific reactive hepatitis was found to be significant for
PCNA positivity (P < 0.05).

Relationship between pinworm and urinary tract infections in young girls.

Ok UZ(1), Ertan P, Limoncu E, Ece A, Ozbakkaloglu B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine,
Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey.

Urinary tract infection is particularly common in young girls and Enterobius
vermicularis (pinworm) is one of the most prevalent worms found in children
worldwide. Young girls, with or without urinary tract infection, were examined
for pinworms in order to explore a possible relationship between these two
problems. Of the 55 young girls with urinary tract infection, 20 (36.4%) had
pinworm eggs in the perianal and/or perineal region monitored using the
cellophane tape method, while 9 (16.4%) of 55 young girls who had never
previously had a urinary tract infection were found to have Enterobius eggs in at
least one of the cellophane tape tests, and the difference was found to be
significant (p<0.05). These results suggested that urinary tract infections may
be related to pinworms. When a urinary tract infection is diagnosed in young
girls, cellulose tape should be applied to both the perianal and the perineal
regions on at least three consecutive occasions.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylül University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.
ozere@cs.med.deu.edu.tr

BACKGROUND: Two types of calcification have been observed in breast lesions. The 
more common is composed mostly of calcium phosphate and is detected in routine
histologic tissue sections of frequently malignant lesions. The rare type is
calcium oxalate and is found exclusively in benign cysts.
CASE: In a 47-year-old female, strongly birefringent polyhedral crystals of
calcium oxalate were detected in benign breast cyst fluid.
CONCLUSION: Calcium oxalate is not clearly visible on routine histologic
sections, and examination of the cytologic specimens under polarized light
reveals them. Awareness of this potential pitfall might lead to conservative
management.

p53 and p16INK4A mutations during the progression of glomus tumor.

Güran S(1), Tali ET.

Author information: 
(1)Gülhane Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Ankara,
Turkey. gurans@gata.edu.tr

Glomus tumors are significantly rare tumors of carotid body. The great majority
of these tumors are benign in character. Here we present two brothers with
hereditary glomus jugulare tumor who had consanguineous parents. Radiotherapy was
applied approximately 8 and 10 years ago for treatment in both cases. Eight years
later, one of these cases came to our notice due to relapse. The mutation pattern
of p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A and p15NK4B genes which have roles in the cell cycle,
was analyzed in tumor samples obtained from the two affected cases in the initial
phase and from one of these cases at relapse. The DNA sample obtained from the
case in initial diagnosis phase revealed no p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A or p15INK4B
mutation. He is still in remission phase. Despite the lack of p53, p57KIP2,
p16INK4A and p15INK4B mutation at initial diagnosis the tumor DNA of the other
case in relapse revealed p53 codon 243 (ATG-->ATC; met-->ile) and p16 codon 97
(GAC-->AAC; asp-->asn) missense point mutations. No loss of heterozygosity in p53
and p16INK4A was observed by microsatellite analysis of tumoral tissues in these 
cases. P53 and p16INK4A mutations observed in relapse phase were in conserved
regions of both genes. No previous reports have been published with these
mutations in glomus tumor during progression. The mutation observed in this case 
may due to radiotherapy. In spite of this possibility, the missense point
mutations in conserved region of p53 and p16INK4A genes may indicate the role of 
p53 and p16INK4A in tumor progression of glomus tumors.

Histopathologic features and expression of Bcl-2 and p53 proteins in primary
gastric lymphomas.

Author information: 
(1)University of Istanbul, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty, Department of Pathology,
Istanbul, Turkey.

The aim of this study is to present a histopathologic and immunohistochemical
analysis of primary gastric lymphomas which were reclassified according to the
concept of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The resected specimens from 
41 patients with primary gastric lymphoma were investigated retrospectively.
Immunohistochemical study was done to analyze the immunophenotype and bcl-2 and
p53 proteins expression. Twenty three of the cases had tumors mainly located in
the antrum. Histologically, 12 were low grade and 20 were high grade B-cell
lymphoma of MALT, 9 other B-cell nonHodgkin's lymphomas. Helicobacter pylori was 
identified in 72% of the cases. According to Musshoff's modification, most of the
MALT lymphoma cases had stage I or II disease. There was significant difference
between low and high grade cases, in respect to depth of invasion in gastric
wall. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells in all MALT lymphomas expressed
B-cell phenotype. Bcl-2 protein was found to be expressed in 59% and p53 protein 
expression was detected in 72% of cases. Among the B-cell lymphoma of MALT, bcl-2
positivity decreased and p53 positivity increased significantly as the
histological grade advanced. So, an inverse correlation was observed between the 
expression of bcl-2 and p53. In conclusion, most primary gastric lymphomas are
low or high grade B-cell MALT lymphomas and appear to arise in MALT acquired as a
reaction to Helicobacter pylori infection. Expression of bcl-2 and p53 in gastric
lymphomas may be associated with transformation from low-grade to high-grade
disease.

Angiomyxomas are a group of relatively rare mesenchymal myxoid tumors. Three
types of angiomyxomas have been identified: superficial angiomyxoma, aggressive
angiomyxoma and angiomyofibroblastoma. These tumors have a predilection for
occurring in the perineum of middle-aged females and are often clinically
diagnosed as Bartholin's cyst. A case of a 42-year-old female with a perineal
angiomyofibroblastoma mimicking a Bartholin's cyst is presented. The pathological
and clinical characteristics of this tumor are discussed.

Cytologic diagnosis and subtyping of rhabdomyosarcoma.

Atahan S(1), Aksu O, Ekinci C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cytology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Turkey.

We reviewed the cytological findings of 38 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with
histological confirmation performed during a period of 15 years and proposed a
morphological subtyping based on the most prominent cytologic features. Seventeen
of these cases were alveolar, 14 cases embryonal, and seven botryoid subtypes.
From these cases, a total of 43 samples, of which 37 were fine needle aspiration 
(FNA) biopsies and six were touch imprints, were evaluated. Detailed cellular
features were identified which enabled differentiation into histological
subtypes. In the alveolar RMSs, most tumour cells were small and lymphocyte-like,
having finely granular chromatin. The finding of cells with more abundant
cytoplasm, eccentrically located nuclei and bi/multinucleated tumour cells in a
background of mucosubstance helped in the differential diagnosis. Two cell types,
including large, tadpole or ribbon-shaped tumour cells and small, round cells
with scant cytoplasm, were seen in embryonal RMSs. In botryoid RMSs, a cell type 
with tightly grouped nuclei within elongated cytoplasm similar to a myotubular
structure was observed in addition to the two cell types of embryonal RMSs. We
conclude that with experience it will be possible to subtype these tumours by
cytologic examination alone.

Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is an uncommon and highly aggressive neoplasm that 
reveals histopathologic features resembling infiltrating duct carcinoma of the
breast and prostate. SDC arising on the basis of preexisting pleomorphic adenoma 
(PA) is very rare. This report describes the fine-needle aspiration (FNA)
cytology of a case of SDC ex PA. FNA smears were cellular with cells with large, 
pleomorphic nuclei, some prominent nucleoli, and finely vacuolated cytoplasm. The
neoplastic cells were forming groups, sheets, and papillary structures and a
cribriform pattern was present in some sheets. Mitotic figures were frequently
seen. Necrosis was prominent in the background. Histologic sections of the tumor 
revealed areas of comedo carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and infiltrative
carcinoma as well as multiple foci of PA. The presence of a cribriform pattern,
tumor cells resembling breast ductal carcinoma cells, and a necrotic background
are helpful features for an accurate cytodiagnosis of SDC.

Author information:

Turkey.

Time-dependent patterns in the susceptibility of the rat gastric mucosa to
ulcerogenic stimuli involving stress or chemical injury have been described. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate whether serotonin (5-HT)-induced gastric
mucosal injury is produced in a circadian fashion in the rat model. In fasted
Wistar rats (adapted for 3 weeks to a standard 12-h light-dark cycle), 5-HT
administered subcutaneously (20 mg/kg, 4 h before autopsy) produced gastric
mucosal injury. The stomachs were removed and the ulcers were scored for
intensity, using a scale of 0-4. In studies performed at 4-h intervals, beginning
1 h after lights-on, most of the mucosal injury occurred at 2000 h, i.e. early in
the dark phase. Likewise, serum corticosterone levels were also found to be high 
at the same time period. The time of 2000 h is approximately determined to be the
beginning of the rats' active period. These results suggest that the extent of
acute 5-HT-induced gastric mucosal injury varies with the time of day and that
elevations in corticosterone concentrations might be responsible for the
5-HT-induced gastric mucosal injury.

Fine needle aspiration of malignant bone lesions.

Kabukçuoğlu F(1), Kabukçuoğlu Y, Kuzgun U, Evren I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Sisli Etfal Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in the 
early diagnosis of malignant bone lesions.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-eight bone lesions that were considered malignant clinically
and radiographically were evaluated by FNA. The results were compared with the
histopathology of the subsequent open biopsies.
RESULTS: An accuracy rate of 89.5% was achieved by FNA. Eighty-four percent of
the cases were consistent with the clinical and radiographic findings.
Chondrosarcoma gave the greatest diagnostic difficulty in the differential
diagnosis with other chondroid tumors. Giant cell tumor cases also produced some 
difficulty when the cytology was hemorrhagic and low in cellularity, displaying
features of other benign bone lesions containing giant cells. Ewing's sarcoma and
multiple myeloma could be identified when interpreted with their coexistent
clinical findings. The metastatic carcinoma cases were also easy to define,
forming another group with a high rate of accuracy.
CONCLUSION: FNA plays a valuable role in the initial diagnosis of malignant bone 
lesions. Cytologic assessment with the clinical and radiologic findings, together
with the experience of the cytopathologist, can yield almost the same diagnostic 
accuracy in the majority of the lesions.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in tuberculous lymphadenitis.

Ersöz C(1), Polat A, Serin MS, Soylu L, Demircan O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Cukurova University, Medical Faculty, Adana, Turkey.

Sixty-three lymph node aspirates were screened and 32 aspirates revealing
granulomatous lymphadenitis with or without caseation necrosis were re-evaluated.
The most characteristic morphological features among these cases were epithelioid
cell clusters with or without caseation necrosis. When clusters were thick,
careful observation of the periphery of the clusters helped to find epithelioid
cells. Caseation necrosis revealed a typical macroscopic and microscopic
appearance. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was negative in all smears and histological
sections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technique was applied to 
23 of the cases in which the cytological diagnoses were consistent with
tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated in 19 (82.60%) cases.IN
CONCLUSION: (i) it is necessary to perform several aspirations from different
sites of the enlarged lymph node; (ii) the diagnosis of 'granulomatous
lymphadenitis, consistent with tuberculosis' can be given, even though the
acid-fast stains are negative; (iii) additional techniques such as PCR give
supportive information; (iv) an open biopsy is recommended if there is a
discrepancy with the clinical impression.

Fate of Schwann cells in CMT1A and HNPP: evidence for apoptosis.

Erdem S(1), Mendell JR, Sahenk Z.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara,
Turkey.

The fate of Schwann cells in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies was addressed
in this study of nerve biopsies from patients with proven PMP22 duplications and 
deletions. In frozen sections, apoptotic nuclei were detected using the TUNEL
method. In adjacent sections, anti-neurofilament 68kD antibody was used as an
axonal marker, while the antibodies to NKH-1 and low-affinity nerve growth factor
receptor P75NTR were used as Schwann cell markers. In addition, plastic sections 
were used to determine the densities of myelinated fibers and Schwann cell
nuclei. In all biopsies from CMT1A, TUNEL-positive nuclei appeared in clusters.
In adjacent sections, areas of TUNEL-positive nuclei matched with areas devoid of
neurofilaments and NKH-1-positive Schwann cell silhouettes, suggesting that the
apoptotic nuclei belonged to nonmyelinating Schwann cells. In addition,
quantitative studies on plastic-embedded sections showed a significantly reduced 
number of total Schwann cells compared with controls, strongly favoring a loss of
Schwann cell by apoptosis. In HNPP, the number of total Schwann cells was
increased and a significant Schwann cell apoptosis was observed in only 2
patients. Examination of plastic sections and teased nerve preparations from
these cases suggested that the Schwann cell apoptosis might be related to the
regenerative state of the nerve resulting from the process of sprout pruning. No 
strict correlation between p75NTR expression and apoptosis was found. These
studies indicate that factors regulating Schwann cell number in early postnatal
development continue to be important for Schwann cell survival throughout life.

Fine needle aspiration cytology of hepatoblastoma. A report of two cases.

Ersöz C(1), Zorludemir U, Tanyeli A, Gümürdülü D, Celiktaş M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic tumor in children. 
The literature contains few examples of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of 
these tumors.
CASES: A 5-month-old and 4-month-old underwent ultrasonography-guided FNA for the
preoperative investigation of hepatic masses. The smears were stained with
May-Grünwald-Giemsa and Papanicolaou stain. Alcohol-fixed smears were used for
immunocytochemistry. All smears revealed cells with round/oval nuclei, prominent 
nucleoli and vacuolated cytoplasm, arranged in groups and acinar structures. The 
groups were embedded in a myxoid stroma. alpha-Fetoprotein was positive in all,
and vimentin was positive in some tumor cells. The cytologic findings resembled
the histologic counterpart in one case, and the other case agreed with the
clinical/radiologic prediagnosis. Immunocytochemistry was supportive.
CONCLUSION: FNA cytology can be diagnostic in many other childhood tumors as well
as hepatoblastomas. Detailed descriptions of cytomorphologic features of
hepatoblastoma will help FNA to be used confidently on these tumors.

HLA-DQB1*0602 homozygosity increases relative risk for narcolepsy but not disease
severity in two ethnic groups. US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder known to be tightly associated with
HLA-DQA1*0102 and DQB1*0602. In this study, we have examined if homozygosity for 
DQB1*0602 increases disease susceptibility and/or severity. Patients diagnosed at
Stanford University (n=160) or enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial (n=509)
were included in this analysis. In both African-Americans and Caucasian-Americans
with or without cataplexy, a significantly higher than expected number of
subjects were DQB1*0602 homozygotes. Relative risks were 2-4 times higher in
DQB1*0602 homozygotes vs heterozygotes across all patient groups. In contrast,
symptom severity did not differ between DQB1*0602 homozygous and heterozygous
subjects. These results indicate that HLA-DQB1*0602 homozygosity increases
susceptibility to narcolepsy but does not appear to influence disease severity.

Congenital epulis is a very rare lesion found only in newborn infants. This tumor
is multiple in about 10% of reported cases, rarely with the simultaneous
involvement of the maxilla and mandibula, as in this article. In the presented
case, light microscopy demonstrated large eosinophilic granular cells arranged in
solid nests that are separated by thin fibrovascular areas. The tumors in the
maxilla and mandibula were investigated with a panel of polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies, and using immunoperoxidase methods on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded sections. Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong and
diffuse cytoplasmic staining for neuron specific enolase and vimentin. However,
all other reactions were negative. These results suggest that the congenital
epulis may be derived from uncommitted nerve-related mesenchymal cells.

Hospital, Adana, Turkey.

New techniques are being searched for the evaluation of cellular morphology and
population of ocular surface. Impression cytology is one of the most preferred
techniques in ocular surface sampling in dry eye, keratitis, and conjunctivitis. 
We evaluated and compared the efficacy of impression and brush cytology in 63
patients. All of the samples collected by the brush technique were sufficient for
diagnosis: 88% of the slides revealed abundant cells and 12% adequate number of
cells. In 21% of the samples observed by impression cytology the cell number was 
inadequate for diagnosis. In 58% of them the cells were abundant and in 21% few
cells were observed. This study proved the value of brush cytology in collecting 
ocular surface cells.

Cytologic diagnosis of complicated pulmonary unilocular cystic hydatidosis. A
study of 131 cases.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Haydarpasa Training
Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of cytochemical stains and microscopic
techniques for the detection of true hydatid elements (primary cytologic
criteria) and to evaluate the efficacy of granulomatous elements (secondary
cytologic criteria) for the diagnosis of complicated pulmonary unilocular cystic 
hydatidosis (CPUCH).
STUDY DESIGN: Sputum, bronchial washing and bronchial brushing specimens obtained
from 131 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CPUCH were reviewed.
RESULTS: CPUCH was histopathologically proven in 111 of 131 patients. Scolices
were found in 11 patients in Papanicolaou-EA65 (PAP-EA65)-stained slides. Special
stains and dark field microscopy (DFM) did not make any additional contribution
to specifying the nature of the scolexlike objects. Hooklets were found in 26
patients in PAP-EA65-stained slides. Masson's trichrome stain and DFM revealed
hooklets in 37 and 50 cases, respectively. Laminated membrane fragments were
found in 14 patients in PAP-EA65-stained slides. Gomori's methenamine silver
stain and DFM demonstrated laminated membrane fragments in 25 and 33 cases,
respectively. Secondary cytologic criteria, such as multinucleated giant cells,
degenerated squamous cells, dyskaryotic squamous cells, excessive amounts of
eosinophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, necrotic debris, fibrinoid
material and erythrocytes, were considered to be suggestive of hydatid disease
when there are more than three such factors in patients with a presumptive
diagnosis of CPUCH.
CONCLUSION: Though DFM examination is superior to cytochemical stains used in
this study, both cytochemical stains and DFM are useful in increasing the
sensitivity of cytologic detection of true hydatid elements, especially hooklets 
and laminated membrane fragments. They should be used as auxiliary techniques.
Secondary cytologic criteria are suggestive of the diagnosis of CPUCH, and
special care should be taken when there are more than three such factors in
cytologic specimens.

Salivary duct carcinoma is a high grade malignancy which histologically strongly 
resembles ductal carcinoma of the breast. The findings from five cases of
histologically proven salivary duct carcinoma sampled by preoperative fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) cytology are presented. Characteristic cytomorphologic features 
include cohesive clusters and flat sheets of epithelial cells which display a
cribriform pattern with eccentrically located, hyperchromatic nuclei, abundant
finely granular cytoplasm, and necrosis in the smear background.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) findings in
hepatic Echinococcus multilocularis.
STUDY DESIGN: FNAB and tru-cut liver needle biopsy were applied in 14 hepatic E
multilocularis cases. Cytologic smears were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa and 
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. Tissue sections were stained with
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and PAS stain.
RESULTS: In tissue sections, homogeneous, thin, cystic structures of various
dimensions strongly stained with PAS. Mucoid material was stained with PAS in the
cystic structures. Wide, coagulative necrosis was observed in all cases. In some 
cases there were foreign body-type giant cells at the periphery of the lesion. In
all the cytologic smears there were an intense necrotic ground, PAS-positive
hyaline cuticular structures and mucoid globules; in some cases there were
foreign body-type giant cells.
CONCLUSION: The above cytologic characteristics are basic diagnostic criteria for
FNAB of E multilocularis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oncology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Balcali,
Adana, Turkey.

Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is a relatively rare entity and has been associated
with a poor prognosis. It is most commonly found in patients with neoplastic
disorders, severe infections and sickle cell anemia. An unusual case of
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with extensive bone marrow necrosis is described 
in a 27 year old woman. The patient presented with severe pancytopenia, some
cognitive impairment resulting from a previous cerebrovascular accident, fever,
hypertension, dyspnoea, tachycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, and vaginal bleeding.
Her laboratory findings included a strongly positive Coombs' test (anti-IgG and
anti-C3d), a prothrombin time of 23 seconds and an activated partial
thromboplastin time of 45 seconds. Anticardiolipin antibody tests were positive. 
Antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies were negative but the anti-SM test was
positive. A bone marrow biopsy specimen was reported as showing extensive
necrosis. The patient was treated with steroids, transfusion, and plasma exchange
with some clinical improvement but her pancytopenia did not respond and
necessitated frequent transfusions. This case lends further support to the
association between APS and BMN.

This study was carried out between January and December 1992 at the Istanbul
Leprosy Hospital. Seven hundred and eleven leprosy patients were evaluated
according to their age, gender and type of disease and disability according to
the WHO disability grading system (1980). There were 527 males (74.2%) and 184
females (25.8%) in the group. The average age was 50.0 +/- 13.5 years and the
average duration of disease was 25.9 +/- 13.2 years. Six hundred and
seventy-eight patients (95.4%) were in borderline (BL) and lepromatous (LL)
leprosy. The extent of disabilities was very high in 711 leprosy patients. It was
found that 539 of the patients (75.8%) had eye disabilities, 511 of them (71.8%) 
had hand disabilities, 521 of them (73.3%) had foot disabilities. The most
frequent eye, hand and foot disabilities were a decrease of vision (52.7), acute 
or chronic iridocyclitis (48.8%), slightly-marked corneal sensory loss (43.2%),
mobile claw hand (33.3%), palmar insensitivity (16.3%), plantar ulcer (37.2%) and
plantar insensitivity (19.8%). Eye deformities were the most common of the three 
affected areas in this study.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical School of Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.

To evaluate the histologic alterations due to the fine-needle aspiration (FNA), a
comparative study between 20 aspirated and 20 nonaspirated thyroidectomy
specimens was performed. The most common findings in the aspirated group were
hemorrhage (80%) and vascular proliferation and/or vascular thrombosis (45%). In 
one of the aspirated cases with the cytologic diagnosis of follicular neoplasm,
histologic sections revealed prominent vascular and endothelial proliferation.
Fibrosis, cystic degeneration, and infarction were other histologic findings in
the aspirated group. Hemorrhage was seen in 45% and cystic degeneration in 25% of
the nonaspirated cases. Fifty percent of the nonaspirated cases did not have any 
additional findings. In conclusion, knowledge of previous FNA application and
awareness of possible histologic alterations due to the needling is necessary
while evaluating the histologic sections of the thyroidectomy specimens.

Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the liver is a rare tumour, only two cases of
which have been reported so far. A third case arising in a 22 year old woman, who
presented with abdominal pain and enlargement of the liver, is described.
Ultrasound and a computed tomography scan showed a solitary hepatic mass, 12 cm
diameter, involving both lobes of the liver. Serum immunoelectrophoresis revealed
an IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy. Histologically, the tumour was composed of
mature plasma cells with mild atypia. The plasma cells infiltrated the liver
parenchyma and showed kappa light chain restriction. The monoclonal nature of the
tumour was also demonstrated by PCR amplification of the immunoglobulin heavy
chain genes. There was no evidence of bone involvement and repeated bone marrow
aspirates and biopsy specimens were normal. The patient was treated with eight
courses of chemotherapy. One year after diagnosis, the patient is well, the size 
of the tumour has decreased and the paraproteinaemia has disappeared.

Immunohistochemical localization of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in in situ and
invasive duct breast carcinomas.

Kapucuoglu N(1), Losi L, Eusebi V.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, S.B. Onkoloji Hastanesi, Ankara, Turkey.

Bcl-2 and Bax proteins are coded by a family of genes that take part in the
manteinance of the balance between cell proliferation rate and programmed cell
death in multicellular organisms. The Bax gene acts as promoter of cell death by 
opposing the death protector effect of the Bcl-2 gene. Expression of the Bcl-2
and Bax proteins has been investigated in 58 cases of duct carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) and duct invasive and invasive lobular carcinomas (IC) of the breast.
While both proteins were expressed at the same time in normal and benign
epithelium, different staining patterns were observed according to the degree of 
differentiation of the neoplastic epithelium. In well-differentiated DCIS and
grade I IC there was a predominance of Bcl-2 protein staining. Grade II lesions
co-expressed both proteins. Poorly differentiated DCIS displayed a predominantly 
Bax protein staining pattern. Therefore, it appears that Bax protein expression, 
especially in DCIS, relates to more aggressive neoplasms while Bcl-2 protein
expression is associated with less aggressive malignant lesions.

A 28-year-old woman was presented with an 1-year history of headache, double
vision and left hand and foot paresthesia. Clinical and CT findings were
evaluated malignant. During the operation a solid mass attached to the falx
cerebri was found. Pathological examination showed a chondroma with large central
cystic degeneration. Our review of the literature revealed only 9 cases of
falcine chondroma up to now, excluding ours.

Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To define the light microscopic cytologic changes due to chemotherapy 
(CT) and/or radiotherapy (RT); to evaluate the differentiation of those changes
according to treatment; to find out whether a relation exists between treatment
type and its duration and the cytologic findings; and to determine the role of
sputum cytology in evaluating efficacy of treatment and follow-up in patients
with inoperable lung cancer of various histology.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1,605 periodic sputum samples from 80 cases of lung
cancer obtained during treatment and follow-up were prospectively examined
cytologically. The relationship of treatment type and duration to qualitative and
semiquantitative data and the definability of the response to treatment as well
as the relationship of progression-free survival (PFS) and total survival (TS)
rates with cytologic data were evaluated.
RESULTS: The majority of therapy-induced cellular changes were in the nucleus and
were directly related to the duration of treatment. An increase in minimally
affected tumor cells, tumor cells that lost their pathologic features and
necrotic cell debris were good indicators of therapeutic efficacy. Cytologic
changes did not reflect PFS and TS rates.
CONCLUSION: Although light microscopic cytologic changes cannot be attributed
objectively to either RT or CT, therapeutic efficacy is shown in follow-up sputum
cytology, which can be used in monitoring and planning additional therapy or
other therapeutic options in lung cancer patients.

The goal of this study was to compare the effects of glucagon and amrinone on
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate, when used alone and in combination, 
in an anaesthetized rat model of verapamil toxicity. Rats were anaesthetized and 
the carotid artery was cannulated for MAP and heart rate measurements. Jugular
and femoral veins were cannulated for drug administration. After verapamil
infusion (15 mg/kg/h), control animals were given normal saline solution and the 
other groups received amrinone (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/min), glucagon (0.3 mg/kg bolus 
followed by 0.1 or 0.2 mg/ kg/min infusion), glucagon plus amrinone (0.1
mg/kg/min and 0.1 mg/kg/min respectively) or glucagon plus amrinone (0.2
mg/kg/min and 0.1 mg/kg/min respectively). Glucagon (0.2 mg/kg/min) significantly
increased MAP when compared to the control group (P < 0.01). The combination of
glucagon and amrinone did not produce a synergistic effect for the recovery of
MAP. Furthermore, this combination masked the positive effects of glucagon (0.2
mg/kg/min) on MAP. Glucagon (0.2 mg/kg/min) increased the heart rates compared
with those of the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, amrinone (0.1
mg/kg/min) plus glucagon (0.1 mg/kg/min) increased the heart rates (P < 0.05).
Finally, glucagon dose dependently recovered MAP. While amrinone depressed MAP in
combination with glucagon, it did not alter the positive chronotropic effect of
high dose glucagon.

Fine needle aspiration cytology of ameloblastoma. A report of 10 cases.

Günhan O(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Medical School, Gülhane Military Medical Academy,
Ankara, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Utilization of fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of
odontogenic tumors seems to have attracted little attention.
CASES: Ten cytologically diagnosed and histologically confirmed ameloblastoma
cases were reviewed in order to establish whether it is possible to obtain a
reliable cytologic diagnosis of ameloblastomas.
CONCLUSION: Attention to the palisading arrangement of ameloblastlike epithelial 
cells and digitated, stellate reticulum-like cells may lead to the diagnosis of
ameloblastoma. Ameloblastomas can be aspirated easily, and the cytologic features
may be sufficiently distinctive.

The effect of acute bilateral adrenalectomy on serotonin-induced inhibition of
gastric acid secretion and acute gastric mucosal injury in rats.

Gidener S(1), Kalkan S, Kupelioglu A, Güre A.

Author information: 
(1)Dokuz Eylut University, Medical Faculty, Department of Pharmacology, Balcova, 
Izmir, Turkey.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) produces many changes in gastric functional
parameters, including the inhibition of gastric acid secretion and changes in
mucosal blood flow. Exogenous 5-HT has also been shown to induce gastric erosion.
The influence of adrenalectomy on experimental lesions in the rat gastric mucosa 
remains controversial. The aim of this study was to see the effects of
adrenalectomy on pentagastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion in anaesthetized 
male Wistar rats. Gastric acid was collected via cannulae placed in the stomach. 
5-HT (3.5 mumol/kg, i.v.) inhibited pentagastrin stimulated acid output by 54%
and produced haemorrhagic gastric lesions with a mean ulcer index of 2 +/- 0.3.
Adrenalectomy prevented both 5-HT induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion
and mucosal injury. The results suggest that the effects of 5-HT require an
intact adrenal gland.

The effects of chemotherapy on breast cancer tissue in locally advanced breast
cancer.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Ankara Oncology Hospital, Turkey.

Comment in
    Histopathology. 1997 Apr;30(4):397-8.

It is well known that chemotherapy induces cytomorphological changes in
neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue. Thirty-one stage III breast-carcinoma
patients, treated with both pre-operative chemotherapy and mastectomy, were
evaluated to define the effects of systemic chemotherapeutic agents in tumours,
non-neoplastic breast tissue, and lymph nodes. Histological changes were compared
with those observed in patients who had been treated by surgery alone.
Cytoplasmic vacuolization was the most striking change in the tumour cells (59%).
Chemotherapy was especially effective in the terminal duct lobular unit in
non-neoplastic breast tissue. Lobular atrophy was observed in 20 (65%) cases, and
lobular cellular atypia was seen in 16 (52%). The rate of ductal cellular atypia 
(42%) was not different from the control group. The most important changes seen
in the non-neoplastic stromal component were fibrosis and hyalinization. These
were found in 31 out of 727 evaluated lymph nodes. In serial sections, metastatic
deposits were seen in or around these fibrotic or hyalinized areas. Chemotherapy 
is widely used in the treatment of early and locally advanced breast carcinomas. 
Familiarity with chemotherapy induced changes in breast tissue and lymph nodes
have considerable importance in the accurate interpretation of these specimens.

Chondrosarcoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology.

Tunç M(1), Ekinci C.

Author information: 
(1)Ankara University Medical Faculty, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To define and discuss the cytologic findings in 6 conventional
chondrosarcomas (CS), 1 chondroblastic osteosarcoma, 1 extraskeletal myxoid CS
and 20 chondroma cases.
STUDY DESIGN: Study of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of cases air dried 
and May-Grünwald-Giemsa stained.
RESULTS: Tumor cells were embedded in a pink, amorphous, chondroid matrix in
conventional CS. They were larger than chondroma cells and had vacuoles and
small, pink, chondroid substance-like granules. Chondroblastic osteosarcoma was
diagnosed as high grade CS by FNAC, but extremely pleomorphic chondrocytes,
osteoid matrix, osteoblastic cells, and clinical and radiologic findings should
have produced the proper diagnosis. Extraskeletal myxoid CS had a pinkish,
granular, myxoid background. The tumor cells had granulated, dark blue cytoplasm 
and oval-round, lobulated, slightly indented, hyperchromatic nuclei.
CONCLUSION: FNAC is efficient for the diagnosis of CS and its variants as long as
it is evaluated with radiologic and clinical findings by a pathologist familiar
with bone pathology and cytology.

Four hundred twenty pneumonic lungs from lambs were examined for Mycoplasma
ovipneumoniae and Pasteurella haemolytica by an immunoperoxidase technique using 
an extravidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded sections. Histologic examination of tissue sections revealed
strong positive reactions in 60.9% and 68.3% of the lungs against M.
ovipneumoniae and P. haemolytica, respectively. M. ovipneumoniae and P.
haemolytica antigens were observed at the surface and/or within the epithelial
cells, macrophages, leucocytes, and bronchiolar exudate. The location of M.
ovipneumoniae in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells and P. haemolytica in the 
neutrophils was detected immunohistochemically.

Carcinoma of buccal mucosa in smokeless tobacco users: a preliminary study of the
use of cytology for early detection.

Erenmemisoglu A(1), Ustun H, Kartal M.

Author information:

Turkey.

A type of smokeless tobacco, known as Maras powder, is widely used in lieu of
cigarettes in the south-eastern region of Turkey. In the present study, we
evaluated cytological smears obtained from the lesion of lower lip mucosa of 80
smokeless tobacco users. There were severe epithelial abnormalities in seven out 
of the 80 subjects. Punch biopsies from these cases disclosed dysplasia in three 
cases, carcinoma in situ in two, and carcinoma in the other two cases. There was 
mild dysplasia in two punch biopsies of the remaining 73 cases. Oral cancer in
tobacco powder users appeared to be related to the length of use, as it was
observed only in subjects with 15 or more years of exposure.

Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in progressive systemic sclerosis. Report of a case 
diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology.

Paksoy N(1), Elpek O, Ozbilim G, Apaydin A, Gençoğlu A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Akdeniz, Antalya, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) is a systemic disorder involving
many internal organs, including the lungs. The occurrence of a pulmonary tumor
has occasionally been reported, especially in long-standing cases.
Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is the most prevalent histologic type.
CASE: A 35-year-old male with a 12-year history of PSS presented with exertional 
dyspnea and pain in the left side of the chest. Fine needle aspiration cytology
(FNAC) showed abundant cellular material with large, monolayered sheets and
papillary structures. The neoplastic cells had uniform round to oval nuclei and
spacious cytoplasm. Some had intranuclear vacuoles. Phosphotungstic
acid-hematoxylin (PTAH) stain revealed structures in the form of prominent cell
membranes rimming the free surfaces of the tumor cells. The overall cytologic
picture was interpreted as consistent with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The
patient's condition did not permit surgery.
CONCLUSION: In this case the development of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma occurred
over a 12-year period following the diagnosis of PSS. This case emphasizes
diagnosis of the tumor solely by FNAC. PTAH stain was also helpful in the
cytologic diagnosis.

Genetics, Ankara, Turkey.

Allele and genotype frequencies for the HLA-DQ alpha locus were determined for
use in forensic analyses in Turkey. The polymerase chain reaction and the reverse
dot blot format were employed to detect six different HLA DQ alpha alleles, which
were detected among 150 unrelated individuals with allele frequencies ranging
from 7% to 26.7%. The distribution of the observed genotypes was in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The discrimination power of this system in the
Turkish population sample was 0.94, and the allelic diversity was 0.81. This
study provides support for the validity of the HLA-DQ alpha procedure for typing 
forensic samples.

Cytologic diagnosis of yolk sac tumor. A report of seven cases.

Mizrak B(1), Ekinci C.

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Cytology Department, Ankara University Medical School, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Yolk sac tumor (YST) is a rare neoplasm that affects children and
adolescents.
CASES: Fine needle aspiration biopsies from seven patients with YSTs were
reviewed. Eosinophilic hyaline cytoplasmic bodies and irregular deposits of
basement membrane-like material were easily recognizable in aspiration smears.
Some of the tumor cells contained cytoplasmic vacuoles. These features correlated
well with histologic appearances.
CONCLUSION: These findings are significant in the fine needle aspiration biopsy
diagnosis of YST. A preliminary cytologic diagnosis of this tumor is valuable as 
a guide in planning further diagnostic studies and therapy.

Serotonin causes acute gastric mucosal injury in rats, probably via 5HT1D
receptors.

Gidener S(1), Apaydin S, Küpelioğlu A, Güven H, Gelal A, Güre A.

Author information: 
(1)Dokuz Eylül University, Medical Faculty, Department of Pharmacology, Izmir,
Turkey.

5-HT-induced acute gastric mucosal injury was assessed in rats by using 5HT1,
5HT2, 5HT3, 5HT4 or muscarinic receptor related drugs. Rats were treated with
antagonists i.p. and 30 minutes later either vehicle, 5-HT (20 mg/kg) or other
agonists were administered s.c. The stomachs were removed 4 hours after the last 
injection and mucosal integrity was assessed by light microscopy using a
histological ulcer index (HUI). The HUI was found to be significantly increased
following 5-HT administration (1.57 +/- 0.3) when compared with controls (0.14
+/- 0.1). 5HT1 agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (20 mg/kg) produced acute gastric 
erosion and increased the HUI (P < 0.05). The HUI in the animals receiving 5-HT1D
agonist sumatriptan (7 mg/kg) was found to be 1.62 +/- 0.24. 5HT2 antagonist
ketanserine (2.5-15 mg/kg), 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron (1-5 mg/kg), 5HT4
antagonist DAU 6285 (1-10 mg/kg) and atropine (1.5-30 mg/kg) exerted no effect
whereas 5HT1/2 antagonist metitepine (0.05-0.5 mg/kg) caused a dose dependent
inhibition of the effect of 5-HT. The results from this study demonstrate that
5-HT causes acute gastric mucosal injury and this injury is probably due to the
activation of the 5-HT1D receptors.

Author information:

Comment in
    J Pathol. 1995 Apr;175(4):367-8.

A sensitive staining method for nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) is described, 
using blue toning of AgNORs. NORs are loops of DNA which are transcribed into
ribosomal RNA. NORs can be demonstrated by staining with silver nitrate, since
NOR-associated proteins are argyrophilic, producing structures termed AgNORs.
Normal blood lymphocytes were stained with both methods. The number and
resolution of NORs increased 2-3 times by blue toning (30 mmol/l FeCl3, 11 mmol/l
potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and 33 mmol/l oxalic acid) compared with silver 
staining. A significant difference in the number of NORs was noticed between
silver-stained and blue-toned cells (P < 0.001). The blue toning technique thus
appears to be more sensitive in detecting NORs than the AgNOR method and may
prove a useful alternative for applications in histopathology.

Finci R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Gülhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey.

Hyaline or amyloid-like substances may be seen in several oral lesions. Some of
these originate from epithelial cells and some from connective tissue components.
In this study, amyloid-like material causing gingival enlargement in three
patients, with eyelid involvement in two, was examined using histochemistry,
immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. These accumulations did not share
the classical features of amyloid such as green birefringence under polarized
light after Congo red staining. Our findings suggest that epithelial degeneration
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these amyloid-like accumulations. 
These substances may be the result of defective amyloidogenesis and our cases may
represent an oral counterpart of ligneous conjunctivitis or colloid milium of the
skin.

Fine needle aspiration cytologic findings in two cases of malignant
lymphoepithelial lesion (MLEL) of the parotid glands are presented. Aspirates of 
both cases showed individual or cohesive clusters of tumor cells intermingling
with mature lymphocytes. Cervical lymph node aspirates in both cases were similar
to those seen in the parotids. Our findings suggest that neither cytology nor
histology of the cervical lymph nodes is conclusive in establishing the primary
site of a metastatic lymphoepitheliomalike carcinoma. MLEL of the salivary glands
must be included in the differential diagnosis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Akdeniz
University, Antalya, Turkey.

Human placental villi from all three trimesters of pregnancy, in 90 non-smoking
pregnants and 244 cigarette smoking pregnants, were investigated. In smokers, the
numbers of syncytial knots and cytotrophoblastic cells increased, depending on
the cigarettes per day, syncytial buds and vasculo-syncytial membranes decreased 
as the pregnancy proceeded. The mean birth weight and placental weight in smokers
were decreased, depending on the cigarettes per day at the third trimester. The
ultrastructure of placental villi from smokers were compared with that on
non-smokers. The villi from smokers had abnormalities of the microvilli, focal
syncytial necrosis, decreased syncytial pinocytotic activity, degenerated
cytoplasmic organelles. Using a morphometric method, the basement membranes were 
measured throughout pregnancy. The mean thickness of the basement membranes of
trophoblastic layer and fetal capillary were found to not only increase with the 
maternal smoking during pregnancy but also attain the maximum in the heavy
smokers by the third trimester of pregnancy. There was increased collagen in the 
villous stroma and shrinkage endothelial changes in fetal capillaries, in smokers
the deleterious effect of the cigarette smoking on the placental barrier was
heavy damage. As a result of impairment of placental barrier, the transports
between mother and fetus were hampered.

Cytological changes in the thyroid glands of 120 patients who had received 131I
treatment for hyperthyroidism were examined in detail. The cytological material
was obtained by fine needle aspiration cytology. The patients were divided into
four groups according to the amount of time elapsed after the 131I treatment. The
control groups were selected from euthyroid patients with hypoactive or
non-functional solitary nodules and patients with Graves' disease who had not
received 131I therapy. The thyrocytes revealed degenerative changes in the
immediate period after cessation of treatment. One year after the treatment some 
non-specific changes, such as oxyphilic metaplasia and regeneration, were seen.
No malignant change has been observed clinically or cytologically during up to 20
years of follow up since receiving 131I.

Fine needle aspiration cytology of oral cavity and jaw bone lesions was performed
on 102 patients. The cytologic diagnoses were compared with the results of
histologic examination. Thirteen of the 15 histologically malignant lesions and
71 of the 87 histologically benign lesions were cytologically diagnosed
accurately. In 12 (92%) of the malignant and 69 (97%) of the benign lesions,
specific cytologic diagnoses were given that proved the same or very similar to
the final histologic diagnoses. This study showed that the overall accuracy of
fine needle aspiration cytology in the oral cavity and jaw bones is high and is
not significantly different from that obtained in other body regions.

Aspiration cytologic findings in a case of benign lymphoepithelial lesion (BLL)
of the parotid gland are presented. The aspirate contained a polymorphous
lymphoid population, histiocytes, myoepithelial and ductal epithelial cells and
numerous bluish, calcified bodies. A cytologic diagnosis of benign nonneoplastic 
lesion, consistent with chronic sialadenitis and microlithiasis, was made. The
clinical impression of neoplasia was inconsistent with the cytologic findings.
Subsequent histologic examination showed classic BLL with microcalcifications as 
an unexpected feature. The value and limitations of fine needle aspiration
cytology in the diagnosis of nonneoplastic salivary gland lesions and the
differential diagnosis of BLL are discussed.

Most patients with gonadoblastoma have dysgenetic gonads. This rare tumour has
been described in three pregnant women. A fourth case in a 26 year old pregnant
woman who presented with gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma, is reported. She had a 
normal term pregnancy, 46XX chromosomes, normal genitalia, no history of
menstrual irregularities and no signs of hyperandrogenism, thereby differing from
the other reported cases. The germ cell component of this patient's tumour had
undergone rapid overgrowth, most of the tumour comprising pure dysgerminoma. It
is suggested that gonadoblastoma may occur in functionally and morphologically
normal gonads more often than previous case reports imply.

Turkey.

The possible contribution of the silver colloid technique for staining nucleolar 
organizer regions in the distinction between benign and malignant adrenocortical 
neoplasms was investigated. Nine cases of adenoma, eight cases of carcinoma, nine
cases of hyperplasia and four normal adrenal cortex specimens were examined. The 
mean silver binding nucleolar organizer region (Ag-NOR) value in adenoma was
4.29, and in carcinoma 7.16 (P less than 0.001). Adenomas with diameters greater 
than 3 cm had significantly higher Ag-NOR counts than smaller adenomas. For
normal cortex, the mean Ag-NOR value was 2.05 and in hyperplasia, 3.62. The
results indicate that the Ag-NOR technique can help in differential diagnosis
between benign and malignant adrenocortical lesions and thus may have a
prognostic value.

Etlik, Ankara, Turkey.

A case of cementifying fibroma in the right lateral mandible was diagnosed by
fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. The aspirate was a cellular specimen
composed of clusters of oval and spindle-shaped fibroblasts with no atypical
features. These cells were admixed with spherical, calcified structures. A
diagnosis of "consistent with benign fibroosseous lesion, suggestive of
cementoossifying fibroma" was made, and subsequent histologic examination
confirmed this cytologic diagnosis. The clinical, cytologic and histologic
findings in the case are presented, and the value of FNA cytology in the
diagnosis of jaw lesions is discussed.

Nucleolar organizer regions in pituitary gland adenomas.

Bayindir C(1), Doğan O, Unal F, Dervisoğlu S.

Nucleolar organizer regions are DNA segments concerned with the synthesis of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Some specific proteins related to NORs can be demonstrated 
by a silver technique and are then referred to as Ag-NORs. The mean number of
Ag-NORs per cell has been used as a marker of cell proliferation in recent years 
and there is some evidence to suggest that Ag-NOR counts can be used to
differentiate between normal and neoplastic cells. Paraffin block sections of 42 
pituitary gland adenomas and 24 normal adult pituitary glands have been examined 
using the Ag-NOR staining technique. Touch imprints of nine adenomas and 12
normal adult pituitary glands were also examined using the same Ag-NOR staining
technique. Using light microscopy at x2000 magnification, the Ag-NORs were
located as black dots in the cell nuclei and the mean number of Ag-NORs per cell 
was determined. No significant difference was observed between blocked sections
and imprints of adenomas or between imprints and paraffin sections of normal
glands. However, a significant difference was observed between the mean number of
Ag-NORs in pituitary gland adenomas and normal glands in paraffin block sections 
and touch preparations (P less than 0.001). The modified Ag-NOR technique can be 
a useful aid in the differential diagnosis between normal pituitary gland tissue 
and pituitary adenomas, especially during surgical operations.

Department, Bornova-Izmir, Turkey.

A total of 160 endocervical specimens collected from 72 symptomatic and 82
asymptomatic women attending a gynecology outpatient clinic were investigated for
genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection by the use of tissue culture and DFA
test. The infection rate was 42% for symptomatic and 23% for asymptomatic patient
groups. The sensitivity rates of the DFA test in the symptomatic and asymptomatic
groups were 84% and 75%, while the specificity rates were 89% and 95%,
respectively. The DFA test had an overall sensitivity of 80% and specificity of
93%. There was 90% agreement between the two techniques. Therefore, DFA is
recommended as an alternative to tissue culture where laboratory facilities are
limited and genital chlamydial infections are highly prevalent.

Effects of ketamine, thiopental sodium and propofol on muscle contractures in rat
diaphragm in vitro.

Ulker S(1), Tok D, Kosay S, Oyman S.

Author information:

Turkey.

The effects of commonly used intravenous anaesthetic agents ketamine, thiopental 
sodium and propofol on the caffeine-alone or halothane-plus-caffeine-induced
muscle contractures were investigated to determine safety for use in patients
susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). The muscle strips from rat diaphragm 
were exposed to one of these anaesthetic agents prior to challenge with caffeine 
8 mmol/l alone or halothane 3% plus caffeine 8 mmol/l together. None of the three
agents induced contractures when added alone. Ketamine 100 mumol/l and thiopental
sodium 300 mumol/l augmented neither caffeine-alone nor caffeine-with-halothane
contractures significantly and these two agents appear to be safe for use in
MH-susceptible patients. In contrast, propofol 150 mumol/l augmented these
contractile responses significantly and may not be recommended for use in
patients known to be susceptible to this anaesthetic complication.

Data on 1,000 medicolegal autopsies have been compiled by the Morgue Department
of the Adana branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine of Turkey, and have been 
reviewed to determine the local differences in causes of death, as well as age
and sex distributions of decedents, in medicolegal deaths in this region. This is
the first report on this subject in this region of Turkey. Unusual categories of 
death and incidences of death are also discussed. The results of this study show 
that the number of medicolegal autopsies and the rate of natural death in Adana
are quite close to those of some other cities of Turkey and some foreign
countries. Contrary findings are revealed in the frequencies of the causes of
death.

The protective effects of methyl cellulose and conoid shields for lagophthalmos
and corneal hypaesthesia in leprosy.

Istanbul, Turkey.

Lagophthalmos and corneal hypaesthesia are amongst the most frequently
encountered lesions in leprosy and they can easily give rise to blindness. Many
measures (such as eye drops, protective conoid shields, muscle exercises,
surgical treatment etc.) have been used to protect the eyes under such
circumstances and this paper examines the protective role of methyl cellulose and
conoid shields in 41 patients. All of them had lagophthalmos (5 mm or more) and
corneal hypaesthesia. They were divided into three groups. Group one had 15
leprosy control patients (27 eyes) who did not use methyl cellulose or eye
shields. Group two had 16 leprosy patients (28 eyes) and they used methyl
cellulose and eye shields when they felt discomfort in their eyes. Group three
had 10 leprosy patients (17 eyes) and they used methyl cellulose and eye shields 
regularly. Statistically significant improvement was seen in group three. Further
studies on larger groups of patients including the effects of different
concentrations of methyl cellulose, on Schirmer test and tear break up time, may 
be of value.

Neurotoxic acrylamide and neurotrophic melanocortin peptides--can contrasting
actions provide clues about modes of action?

Edwards PM(1), Sporel-Ozakat E, Gispen WH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Bogaziçi University,
Istanbul, Turkey.

Experimental acrylamide neuropathy has been studied as a model of degenerative
neurological disorders of the 'dying-back' type for over 30 years. Functional,
histological, ultrastructural, electrophysiological and biochemical aspects of
acrylamide neuropathy have been described and several hypotheses concerning the
mode of action proposed. However, the mechanism whereby acrylamide causes axonal 
degeneration and inhibits nerve sprouting remains unknown. By analogy with
agonist/antagonist comparisons used by the pharmacologist, we have reconsidered
the acrylamide problem in the light of the opposite effects summarized in Table
1, of neurotrophic peptides related to ACTH/MSH (collectively termed
melanocortins). The contrasting effects on sprouting and the eventual quality of 
repair of mechanically lesioned nerves have suggested a mechanism whereby
sprouting may regulate perikaryal adjustments to injury. We have also posed the
question as to whether a common biochemical mechanism, namely selective
proteolysis of neurofilament protein may underlie the opposing effects of
acrylamide and melanocortins on nerve sprouting. This possibility implies a
hitherto unknown role for neurofilament protein turnover in neuronal maintenance 
and repair, a suggestion that may provoke further research and discussion.

The first of the three groups of rats was taken as a control and the other two
groups were injected with high (15 mg/kg) and low (5 mg/kg) doses of ferric
ammonium citrate given intramuscularly twice daily for 5 days. Pyelonephritis was
produced in all groups by intravenous inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus.
Serum and urine of each rat was collected periodically and their iron content was
determined. The severity of pyelonephritis was evaluated by determination of
bacterial growth and pathological lesions in kidneys after 10 days of bacterial
inoculation. The results showed that parenteral iron administration markedly
aggravated pyelonephritis development in rats. But there was no significant
difference in the severity of pyelonephritis between rats treated with high or
low iron doses.
